# lucy_deiwald_trans-reddit-corpus
Raw Data and scripts used to build a trans reddit corpus containing ~85 million words.

The individual raw data is sorted by year and month.
01 equals January, 02 February etc.
These are generated by "running parser.py" on pushshift's monthly data

The "subreddit_view" folder includes all submissions of the year filtered by subreddit, 
generated by running "subreddit_filter.py" and the {name}-result.json files contain the search terms 
specified in "word_analyser.py" and also a link to the submission of every word.

"copy_formatter".py is used to output the .json format into a .csv file.

Make sure you have python3 with nltk and pandas installed.
Create the required folder structure and change the location variable in the
respective files to the root folder of the data.
