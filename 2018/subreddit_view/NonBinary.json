The most amazing thing is that once I figured out I'm not cis, it took me all of an hour to figure out *exactly* where I fit in the transgender spectrum. I am both female and male. Even though I was 47, there was no adjustment for me, no upset or doubt. It was immediately liberating, a relief to finally have an answer to why I'd felt so out of place from childhood. My identity settled into my bones easily. Perhaps because I never knew it was there to hide it. I've just gone with it, never knowing what it was. When I started coming out to family and friends, a common response was \"yeah, that makes sense\" or \"I didn't have a name for it, but I knew it.\" Sometimes I think I was the last to know.\n\nOver the last year that led me to explore exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge. Did I want to make any kind of transition? Presentation (clothes, hair, etc)? Hormonal? Medical/surgical? I experimented a bit. I tried testosterone, and it was right, until it wasn't. I bought some men's clothes. Got my hair cut short.\n\nFor a while I was kinda stuck in the middle, situationally one or the other for short periods of time, but usually both, not really a mix in the middle like an androgyne person, but able to see/feel/be both sides more or less equally. Then I went on the strongest masc swing of my life. I felt like I was a transguy, completely. I couldn't see the girl in me at all, except for my continued love of all things girly and sparkly. I loved my testosterone, and began to consider a full physical transition. It lasted several months. Then I went on the first *totally girl* swing of my life. It was my dearest wish from the time I hit puberty to really FEEL like a girl. I would much rather be cis female than any other option. And I loved it. I quit testosterone and went *full girly* and it felt as amazing as I imagined it would. I'm still on that swing. At the moment I feel like I'm cis female, but I know my guy side will eventually come back.\n\nI've also figured out that while my guy side is a guy, and wants to be a guy, for the most part, I don't want to look like a guy, I want to be a guy. I like my outer girly appearance (perhaps my guy side is okay with it because I'm not particularly naturally feminine in build) and love girly clothes and sparkly things. But I also get an odd dual pleasure out of wearing all guy clothes - and making them look totally femme.\n\nSo, one year in and I am amazed to be able to say I've pretty much figured out who I am and what I want.

When I was 14/15 I discovered the concept of being transgender and came out as genderfluid. I thought about this for a while and realised I might actually be a 100% binary trans man. It was too overwhelming to deal with so I went back into the closet.\n\nA few months ago I came out again, but as a trans man. I asked people to use he/him pronouns and use a new name for me, for christmas I got male gendered presents and I started living as male for a month or so. It was great. Then something happened (I met my boyfriends family) and I realised that I won't be able to transition for the foreseeable future so I became \"okay\" with that. I'm not sure if I'm in denial or not. Now when I think about presenting as male, I feel weird, almost dysphoric. \n\nI started dressing overly girly and wearing makeup and wigs like I've done several times in the past. I have a history of trauma and mainly like appearing as a girl to get attention from men. (I know, it's awful.) I like the way I look in female clothes because I get complimented and think of myself as attractive. I feel more confident and sexy as a girl but it feels like an overly-dramatised version of myself, like it's just acting and eventually i'll stop pretending and be \"me\" again. I do enjoy acting like a girl though. I have dysphoria but it comes and goes, sometimes it's severe and sometimes it's not there at all. \n\nWhen I present as male, I feel more \"me\" but I don't feel attractive at all. I don't know if me switching between these girl and guy phases means I'm genderfluid or whether I'm just in serious denial about my gender and seeking validation by dressing as a woman. If a cis guy cross-dresses for sexual reasons, they're not trans, so wouldn't it be the same for a trans guy? (Only it would mean they were infact male)\n\nAny input?

Yesterday however things came crashing down and I\u2019m in the midst of a full blown identity crisis right now.\n\nA little bit of background: I\u2019m a 27yo AMAB and I\u2019ve low-key been questioning my gender and sexuality since roughly the end of puberty - so for about 10 years. As a child/teen I\u2019ve been totally fine with being a boy and the prospect of only dating girls. At 17 I came out to myself as bi, triggered by the fact that i had developed a crush on a male friend of mine. In the years ~5 years after that I continued to question my sexuality as I went through the \u201cbi-cycle\u201d and got some practical experience. Result: I\u2019m predominantly attracted to women but also to men, to a lesser degree though. \n\nOn to the gender part: I wasn\u2019t fully comfortable with the male role for that same period of time but until recently didn\u2019t put a label onto it. I\u2019ve mainly played women in video games for about 10 years, I\u2019ve been given a female nickname by at one point of which I approved, so it stuck, and I first acknowledged feminine aspects of my identity in a non-playful/joking when I stumbled upon the \u201cGenderbread Person\u201d. But to me all of that wasn\u2019t a denial of masculinity so much as something extra. I thought of my masculinity as just being somewhat more sensitive and non-macho. That changed last year when one of my favorite YouTubers ContraPoints (if you don\u2019t know her, srsly check her out, she\u2019s amazing) came out as genderqueer. I guess seeing you respect adopt a non-binary identity makes it less scary to see yourself that way. I thought of **agender** as a term that could fit me but so far hadn\u2019t committed to it. \n\nEnter the worst sex of my life. Yesterday I had a one-night stand with a women and it was terrible. What really got to me is that other than all my previous partners she didn\u2019t treat me like a person, she treated me like a **man**. Everything she did was done with the assumption that I am a man: Foreplay? Not needed. Erogenous zone? Just the dick. Body that is meant to be desired? Just hers, never mine. Dirty talk? Meant to boost my masculinity (god, that was irritating). Throughout the whole process I had to steer her away from that.\n\nI had never realized this before but everything that I had ever enjoyed about sex was not explicitly gendered. The sex I had with women could have been either straight or lesbian (if we consider the social roles involved). The sex with men could have been gay or straight. For years while trying to figure out my sexuality I\u2019ve only considered the other persons gender and never my own. \u201cWhat portion of me is gay, what portion is straight?\u201d Surprise motherfucker, some part is actually lesbian!\n\nSince I live in a large city in a western country surrounded by progressive minded people the issue of gender doesn\u2019t come up in the rest of my life that often but I think the pattern just described applies. I\u2019m fine with the way I\u2019m treated as long I\u2019m not expected to be a man. \n\nAnd now I\u2019m sitting here with the unavoidable conclusion that I\u2019m not in fact a man. I don\u2019t know what I am. Agender, genderfluid, maybe even trans women (I really hope not, that would have some uncomfortable consequences in terms of transitioning)? Outside the occasional societal pressure I don\u2019t feel that uncomfortable with myself. I accept my body, i just don\u2019t like how hairy it is. I don\u2019t have a desire to be seen as a woman, even though I feel good if things about me are feminine. I\u2019ve realized a while ago that the sentence \u201cI am a man\u201d feels like a lie. Other statements like \u201cI am [a woman | genderqueer | agender]\u201d don\u2019t feel true the either though.\n\nTL;DR: Fuck gender.", "date": "2018-01-07 11:19:11", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7oq3aq/long_winded_exploration_of_the_shit_show_that_is/", "author": "ThrowyMcThrow4way"}, {"title": "AFAB, 21, stuck in a confused thought cycle about NB/Genderqueer identity", "text": "Hey all,\nThis is gonna be a disjointed kind of post, because I am really confused and distressed atm; heads up.\n\nI am AFAB, but since I was introduced to the concept of gender beyond cis female and cis male (about 17/18) I have questioned my cis gender 'status', as it were, on and off.\n\nI have gone through a few \"AHA!\" moments, thinking I'd resolved my confusion, only to have myself revisit the same shit over and over and over.   \n\nI have come to the conclusion that I'm cis female, but I am gender non-conforming twice now, only to self doubt all over again when something triggers the topic within me. \n\nA big thing that I am grappling with is that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Asperger's, which makes me worried that I'm forcefully trying to take on a new persona to avoid who I am currently; that I'm grasping to TRY TO be Enby/Demi, instead of ACTUALLY being Enby/Demi .  \n\nThe last month or so I've had the repeated thought of \"I don't WANT to be a cis woman!\" and I am trying to figure out if that's because I'm legitimately NOT or because again, I am desperately trying to be something else and just don't want to be ME; if that makes sense?\n\nI feel like, if someone said to me \"Okay tomorrow you will be a \"passable\" man\"  I wouldn't be upset about losing my identity as a woman.

I distinctly recall mimicking Renton from Trainspotting's [pose](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e5/ae/db/e5aedb63e0f8b65dc67c5f85215ea5b4--trainspotting-poster-renton-trainspotting.jpg) and purposefully lowering my voice around male peers to break out of the \"like other girls\" mould.  \n\nI look at all male hardcore bands and wish I looked more like them, [aesthetically](http://www.fearlessrecords.com/fearlessrecords/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movements_10000.jpg) but also ROCK a dress and love getting made up.  \n\nBasically, around women I feel out of place and not feminine/pretty enough, and awkward, and around men I feel tiny and too femme and I envy them.\n\nI am so confused and wish there was a way to tell if I don't like being cis because I am NOT CIS, or because I am so desperate to be ~different~ and NOT ME.   It might be fruitful to mention that my best friend is MTF Trans; but I met them AFTER I started questioning at 18 (1.5 years later-ish?) so I am not sure that is a factor here.   \n\nThanks for reading my ramble!", "date": "2018-01-07 16:24:02", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7orgvj/afab_21_stuck_in_a_confused_thought_cycle_about/", "author": "CupcakeCat96"}, {"title": "some personal issues", "text": "so, first off, i'm nonbinary, specifically, i identify as bigender. i've recently felt very.. alienated lately.

So, when I went to the bathroom or showered, and was kinda grossed out by my genitals, I figured that was completely normal. Or, when I saw a woman in a dress and wondered what I might look in it, I figured everybody had feelings like that. Come to find out, that is not really the case. But, nevertheless, I never thought that my feelings were strong enough to warrant any meaningful deviation from the norm.\n\nEven after the increased in trans awareness over the past few years, I still did not see myself as a part of that group if only because many of the stories, and the way they were presented all seemed to come across in the same way. \"I always knew I was X despite constantly being told I was Y, but now, I am able to realise my true self.\" But since I was not entirely certain, or did not feel as strongly about my identity growing up, I felt that I did not belong in said group. It seemed as though if I was a particular way, I would know it, or would at least have always suspected. Since I didn't, I figured I wasn't.\n\nIt's also hard to know whether or not my feelings \"qualify\" me as part of these groups because when asked what dysphoria or whatever else feels like, people find it hard to describe. So, here I am, wondering if what I'm feeling is similar to what others feel, and neither of us can describe what that feeling is.\n\nAnyway, over the last few years I've been interrogating how I feel about certain things, and begun to suspect that I might be nonbinary. But, since the \"feelings\" that make me think this do not present all the time, when they are in remission, of sorts, I begin to doubt whether or not they were ever really there at all. I visit the LGBT Resource center where I go to school in the hopes that the environment might bring them about. But, all I see around me are people who feel completely certain in who they are. And all it reminds me of is how certain I am not. And let me just say that I understand there is no way of knowing how someone really feels based on their outward appearances, but still. I continue to feel out of place.\n\nA while back, I watched [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_alNELGiHI) video and in the description was a link to [this](http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/bsri.html?A1=3&amp;B1=6&amp;C1=6&amp;A2=6&amp;B2=3&amp;C2=2&amp;A3=4&amp;B3=5&amp;C3=6&amp;A4=6&amp;B4=3&amp;C4=5&amp;A5=4&amp;B5=6&amp;C5=4&amp;A6=5&amp;B6=6&amp;C6=2&amp;A7=2&amp;B7=4&amp;C7=5&amp;A8=6&amp;B8=6&amp;C8=2&amp;A9=2&amp;B9=5&amp;C9=6&amp;A10=2&amp;B10=5&amp;C10=2&amp;A11=1&amp;B11=6&amp;C11=6&amp;A12=3&amp;B12=3&amp;C12=2&amp;A13=2&amp;B13=4&amp;C13=3&amp;A14=4&amp;B14=2&amp;C14=6&amp;A15=6&amp;B15=6&amp;C15=3&amp;A16=1&amp;B16=2&amp;C16=5&amp;A17=2&amp;B17=2&amp;C17=3&amp;A18=1&amp;B18=2&amp;C18=4&amp;A19=2&amp;B19=6&amp;C19=6&amp;A20=2&amp;B20=6&amp;C20=2) quiz.

Anyway, they were really pleasant and, while they were there, I really wished I had a dress to put on or something. Unfortunately, the way things are, it would be deemed very inappropriate, and, even if it didn't, because of the way the binary is constructed, and ingrained, to dress in a way that deviates, or is deemed deviant (ie, be read as male and wear a dress) is to commit (ie claim that you now want to be perceived in a particular permanently.) I guess since I feel very nebulous about the situation, I do not want to dress a particular way, thus making a declaration of sorts, only to retract later.\n\nIn the short time that I have been on this sub, I have read about similar experiences others have had, which seem very similar to mine. I hope that maybe some who have, or are currently dealing with something similar might be able to provide me with insight or strategies they've used, or are trying, to navigate this...confusion? Uncertainty? Whatever. Thank you in advance to those who take the time to read this and to those who decide to respond.

It was literally my first sexual experience of any kind with another human being and, slightly misanthropic, asexual-identifying me, had to admit... I really liked it.\n\nIn the weeks after that, I RP,d any moment I could, my character evolved and I woke up a latent crossdressing fetish i always suspected, I was put in miniskirts and on a leash, slapped and called all kinds of nasty names, and I loved it.\n\nThe still-growing problem I'm dealing with even today is, however, when I look up from that screen and into a mirror, there are no big, shiny eyes and sharp, soft ears, no deliciously androgynous body and cute fluffy tail. But instead a depressed-looking\nFellow who has recently started growing facial hair at a decent rate and who can't gain a single pound.\n\nI've unfortunately grown to be shocked and disturbed by my own body in recent months, I can't reconcile my personality with this body, I remember once I tried to shave my legs just to help a little. But the blade was dull and I had prickly feelings all day instead of smoothness. I came to loathe the idea of masculine and feminine things being seperate even more than I already had, and for better or worse, nearly worshipping androgyny as a concept and the highest thing I could attain. One of my friends is beautifully androgynous and as much as Iove him, I do get pangs of jealousy.\n\nI can't stop thinking about how I could possibly look more androgynous without worrying my family, they already suspect some kind of eating disorder because I'm just very skinny. I really don't think I count as transgender. I feel the opposite of a strong inclination towards one side or the other, I just hate having this hairy body and square-ish face structure, doesn't feel like me and is leaving me very, very confused.\n\nPerhaps I've rambled, but I needed to get this internal struggle out somehow, I hope I don't come off as ignorant or unnecessary.\n\n\n\n\n", "date": "2018-01-09 08:44:45", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7p5url/nsfw_tmi_my_sexuality_is_confusing_the_hell_out/", "author": "Cennelath"}, {"title": "non binary person struggling with adult life and gender", "text": "", "date": "2018-01-09 19:40:00", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7p9mfr/non_binary_person_struggling_with_adult_life_and/", "author": "Owliwar"}, {"title": "My dad found this awesome gender neutral bathroom", "text": "", "date": "2018-01-09 19:47:36", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7p9oip/my_dad_found_this_awesome_gender_neutral_bathroom/", "author": "amaranthincx"}, {"title": "Formality Question", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-01-10 00:18:18", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7pbmh8/formality_question/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "a chill server looking for chill trans folk", "text": "", "date": "2018-01-10 02:24:58", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7pcf6p/a_chill_server_looking_for_chill_trans_folk/", "author": "chillyleopard13"}, {"title": "Nonbinary Actors", "text": "During today\u2019s lecture. we discussed the history of theatre and gender.

I'm AMAB and recently getting into femme clothing and presentation, and I really want to get some breast forms to wear until I can start on HRT.

My inclination is towards C because I feel like going too large won't look the way I want, but I also want it to show up enough to look like boobs and not just big pecs. The problem is that I'm 6' 4\", 240 lbs and pretty lean (the weight I think comes from muscle built in the metal shop I work in, and also the fact that I am unfortunately broad shouldered which makes it harder for me to not get read as male) so I feel like C cups have a good chance of being too small on me, but I don't want to overdo it either. I also intend to do anaerobic workouts to keep on as much muscle as I can once I do start HRT since I do like my strength and it is useful for the job I currently do, so even after HRT I should hopefully not shrink too much, which should mean that the forms won't look too much bigger as HRT starts to kick in before I have my own natural breasts.\n\nIn any case, anyone have any opinions? I know that my band size is about 38\", and with regards to women in my family I know that larger tends to be the norm, but I'm just scared of getting the E cup and having it look like I'm doing drag or otherwise being distracting when the ideal would be that I look somewhat like some of my AFAB enby friends who lean slightly femme of androgynous, or even be able to have a shot at passing as a woman when I'm made up really femme.

The second time, it was from a bi girl, who left me for totally different reasons. \n\nThe point is: in both this relationships I felt that things would have been different if I was a man. With the first one I kept thinking to myself that if I was a man we would be dating for sure and happy, and all of the suffering that I was going through would have not happened. When I was with the second girl I used to think something like: \u201cwell she\u2019s bi, so she can love me even if a become a man\u201d.\n\nToday, about a month after the second girl broke up with me, I saw a woman give birth at the hospital where I work. After the baby was born the nurse brought the baby to her face and you could fill the love in the room. The thing is: this girl reminded me so much of my ex, that is was painful to watch. I had to step away. At that moment a thought crossed my mind that I will never be able to get any girl pregnant, because I am not a man and I never will be. And this just augmented the pain. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to make of all of this.

I was just wondering what people's self-image is like when it comes to being in what seems 'a normal' relationship between man and woman (even writing that feels wrong).

Some days I feel great, confident, attractive. My boyfriend couldn't care less about this btw, he's wonderfully supportive always. But whenever our friends are with us and they've got their girlfriends it always makes me feel ashamed. I don't know what it is, but it's like I feel bad for not being what I'm 'supposed' to be. \n\nSo I try to make up for it by accentuating my chest and other typically feminine traits but that makes me want to curl up into a ball and hide forever. (I hate my chest so much and it's the source of the majority of my dysphoria).\n\nI just wish being myself didn't have to feel hard.", "date": "2018-01-12 05:13:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7puegf/being_nb_in_an_opposite_sex_relationship/", "author": "sniffinglilees"}, {"title": "At a year and some months on hrt, I am questioning my gender again", "text": "I am amab, have been on hrt for 14 months.

I thought at the time. I rushed into hrt, rushed into all of it and you know what? I love the changes. I recently changed my legal name and gender marker so even the govt recognized me as female even when my family doesn't.\n\n**WEIRD**\n\nBut now here I am, questioning my gender again. I'll be honest, I don't understand nonbinary genders. I just don't. I respect it and I've known enbies and never had issue using gender neutral language and pronouns. That's easy but I still don't understand the gender.\n\nAnd yet somehow I'm starting think that I might be nonbinary. I love that my body now has most of the qualities of a typical female body. I love my curves and my breasts and my softness. I love the changes in my facial features. I love that I smile more now. I love that I cry more now. When I get to have srs one day, I will love my new parts.\n***\nAnd that is what confuses me. How can I be nonbinary if I love the features of my body that are specific to a binary gender? But I remember the first time someone asked me my pronouns. I remember the conflict I felt. Sitting in a coffee shop at a bdsm munch, having been out to everyone in my life and no one questioning my femaleness ever.\n\nAnd I think no one ever asked me my pronouns because I was obviously female...right? But I honestly hesitated after the question and very nearly said she/her they/them. But I didn't, just stuck to the female pronouns.\n\nI was excited at first to pass as female to complete strangers. I was excited to wear things like skirts and dresses and see a very feminine figure in the mirror. But that wore off and now when I dress very femme, it just feels wrong.\n***\nI find myself most comfortable when wearing more androgynous clothing like jeans, a tank top, leather jacket, and chucks. Like everything I'm wearing but the shoes might be women's clothing but it's definitely not femme.\n\nBut when I dress like that I feel awesome and bad ass and confident. For a while, since I am also a lesbian, I thought that maybe I could give the whole butch aesthetic a try but the idea of wearing purposely masculine clothing makes me feel dysphoric.\n\nI also almost kinda feel like it'd be cool be like a pre-pubescent person again. Like, that sounds weird I know and I hope this isn't creepy. I hope at least someone here might understand. I remember being very thin and baby-faced and having the features of an adolescent but not an adult...and I liked that. I still want to have sex and be sexual which is why the idea of being physically like someone who is pre-pubescent kinda creeps myself out.\n\nBut like, I wanna be an adult child...I guess? Fuck I don't even know. But aside from breasts, I like the idea of not having characteristics associated with either gender. I don't mind people seeing me as female even if that's inaccurate though.\n***\nSo I guess the big question is: Can I be a nonbinary gender but still want a body that is visibly female? Can I be nonbinary and not have a strong desire for gender neutral pronouns?\n\nAnyway, for anyone who read all of that, I thank you. Even if you don't respond, thank you for reading it.

I'm really scared to ask them to use my pronouns because I know they won't understand, and it will just always be a horrible cycle of them misgendering me and then correcting themselves and making a big deal out of it and it just sounds exhausting. \n\nSo I don't know.

So anyway, I started researching top surgery to see if there were different levels to it, and I found that it uses the same technique as breast reduction. I contacted a private gender clinic to request more info and I'm waiting to hear back. But since I've already been rejected for breast reduction, does it mean I don't have much chance of getting top surgery? \n\nI'm just really uncomfortable in my body and binding does nothing for me. I have a pretty small frame, and sports bras somehow make me look even bigger. I don't want to go completely flat, I'd just like the choice of binding (successfully) when it feels necessary, but also being able to wear a bra (even the smallest size) when I feel the need.\n\nSorry for rambling.

What the heck does non-binary mean?**\n\nA. From the Gender Wiki (gender.wikia.com):\n\n*\u201cNon-binary gender (see also genderqueer) describes any gender identity which does not fit the male and female binary.\u201d*\n\nAll gender is a performance, so instead of following someone else\u2019s script, I\u2019m writing my own.\n\n**Q. So what gender are you?**\n\nA. I don\u2019t feel comfortable identifying (or being identified) with any gender.\n\n**Q. Since when?**\n\nA. For many years now I\u2019ve felt uncomfortable being referred to in terms of the gender binary. I\u2019ve used the term non-binary when thinking about myself for about a year.\n\n**Q. Does this change how I talk about you?**\n\nA. Only a little. I use *they* pronouns, for example:\n \n*\u201cIs /u/Kuttle here yet?\u201d*\n\n*\u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve arrived yet. They\u2019re not at their desk.\u201d*\n\nIt also means you should use non-gendered language, such as \u201cchild\u201d instead of son/daughter, \u201csibling\u201d instead of brother/sister, etc.\n\n**Q. But society categorises people into man or woman / but what about \u201cbiological sex\u201d and chromosomes / but my religion says\u2026**\n\nA. I understand that western culture is really hung up on categorising people into either male or female (some other cultures not so much). Gender non-conformity is about stepping outside those things, saying \u201cthat isn\u2019t me\u201d and just being who you are without these societal expectations.\n\n**Q. So this a just political thing?**\n\nA. Any gender issue is considered political, so sure. But I didn\u2019t think \u201cYou know what, I\u2019m going to fight the patriarchy by changing my gender identity!\u201d What I did think was \u201cThis is a thing I\u2019ve been feeling for a really long time and now I\u2019ve worked out what words I want to use to describe it.\u201d\n\n**Q. Are you changing anything about yourself?**\n\nA. You might notice changes in my clothing and other things like hair or makeup.\n\n**Q. Are you still gay?**\n\nA. That one\u2019s kind of complicated. Words like \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cstraight\u201d only work within a gender binary.

I wear trousers. I don\u2019t wear makeup. However I do not identify as male or female, and I prefer they/them/their pronouns.\n\nMost of my friends and family are aware of this, however they continue to use male pronouns for me - this doesn\u2019t tend to offend me as I know there is no malicious intent. \n\nMy partner considers herself a heterosexual woman. The fact that she\u2019s with me does challenge that somewhat, and it\u2019s something we discuss from time to time, however she doesn\u2019t think it makes any difference - it\u2019s a \u201cI\u2019m with you, and that\u2019s all that matters\u201d kind of thing. \n\nSo we present to the world as a heterosexual couple, one male, one female, but just to be clear - I am a non-binary person.\n\nNow we come to the fun part: we are in our 30s and are now at the time of our lives when a lot of our friends are getting married. And time and time again, we are being invited to gendered events. \nI can\u2019t help but feel a little offended, and even misgendered, by being invited to an all-male event, whilst at the same time I appreciate that my friends might have felt equally awkward about not inviting me. \nMeanwhile my SO is in a bind, because she doesn\u2019t really want to go to an all-female event either, however feels immense pressure to go and be girly.\n\nSo... the most recent time I was invited on a stag weekend, I simply said that I wouldn\u2019t be coming. I didn\u2019t make any excuses up, I simply said I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable at an all-male event, thanks for the invite, nothing personal etc. I tried not to make it all about me - and tried not to offend him. He took it really well actually, although he was disappointed that I wouldn\u2019t be attending, he totally appreciated my honesty.\n\nAnd now, the weekend is upon us. My SO and I just had an impassioned discussion about it, but ultimately she chose to go and is at the girls event right now. (Needless to say, I was not invited to that).\n\nI am sitting here feeling a whole load of things: I feel disappointed and let-down by my partner, whilst I respect her decision to go to this thing, I can\u2019t help but feel unsupported by her.\n\nSo... apologies for the very long message. I have no NB friends in my life, so wondering if anyone out there can share how they have dealt with these tricky situations.\n", "date": "2018-01-20 13:01:15", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7rq95e/dealing_with_staghen_dos_aka_bachelor/", "author": "SaltPatience"}, {"title": "Hmmm", "text": "", "date": "2018-01-20 19:56:20", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7rso39/hmmm/", "author": "jjdnorthpark"}, {"title": "Breaking Free of Gender Through Friendship and Attack Zeen.[Pink and Black Anarchy Lit]", "text": "", "date": "2018-01-20 23:39:07", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7ru207/breaking_free_of_gender_through_friendship_and/", "author": "goat-mouse"}, {"title": "Came out before I was ready", "text": "Honestly I just need to vent a little to people I know understand me.

I was the one who suggested they insist on others using \"they\" and correct them if anyone used \"she\" instead of shrugging and dying instead when others say \"she\". \n\nSome more time passed, and after doing the insisting on \"they\" pronouns, they go to their families house for the holidays and said they came out to family, all of which completely invalided their existence. Almost right after that, this shift happened from non binary to gender fluid. I figure, using your name and \"they\" is still fine since it's kinda of a safe option when referring to anyone. Well, not exactly. \n\nNow they \"feel a gender coming on\" and \"switch\" and want me and everyone else to change names AND pronouns (neutral to male and back, female is never okay) depending on how they think they're changing their voice. \n\n I suggested having a reversible name tag so that when they feel the switch, we could switch over based on the tag. They don't want to do that and say it *so* obvious that the voice is switching.

I know gender is incredibly nuanced, but here's what I posted on another formed.\n\nAddon: I'd probably replace the 'female, but!' with 'female, and!'\n\nEdit: I'm fine with labels, and I'm trying to figure out which ones might fit. It was my therapist who has a vendetta against labels.\n---\nThe long short of it is this; I've been questioning my gender for awhile, and I'm wavering between genderqueer/nonbinary and simply being a cis who's over thinking things.\n\n\n\nI don't know where to begin with this. I think my main issue with figuring out my identity is that I am comfortable being seen/identified as a female; however there has been a 'but!' on the end of this sentence for a long time, probably since freshman year [I'm out of HS now]. \n\n\n\nFor quite awhile I've had the thought of \"It would be nice if people could see me as female, but! also not\" or \"I want to be female, but! also not\". A convoluted internal conversation where I struggle with the fact that while I'm AFAB and I don't particularly fight against that, yet I do disagree. But not completely. If I was having a conversation with an other world entity and they were like, hey pass the sugar, also what's your gender? I'd say \"I'm female+, like, female but also not?\"\n\n\n\nA few years ago (like, age 16) I went through a sexual trauma that sent my life into a very weird place. I was 100% sure I wasn't cis. I bought a binder- and wore it- I dressed neutral as possible (I've always had a large chest and hips), and I even went so far as having some people refer to me with he/him or they/them.\n\n\n\nBut then it... changed?\n\n\n\nI finally started processing my trauma, and the feelings just... calmed down. My feelings of 'female, and!' didn't go away completely, but I kind of invalidated myself and said my entire experience was because of my trauma, I'm 10p% cis, stop trying to be a special snowflake.\n\n\n\nBut the problem is back again? Again, after years of internal silence, I'm having these thoughts of being female+. Of wanting to be. Of wanting to be seen by other people as female, but!\n\n\n\nI've reached out to my closest friend about this, and they have been very supportive. They're a binary trans person themself, which is part of why I went to them, thinking they would have some opinions? Maybe? \n\n\n\nThey've pointed out that it doesn't really line up, to them, that I still want to be female. At least partially. And that I have 0 desires to me a man or be masculine. And just. Well, it's put a strain on things, and I regret bringing the topic up.\n\n\n\nI tried speaking with an older therapist of mine, who's also a certified gender therapist. They're very against labels and essentially our entire conversation was them going \"Why do you think about these labels? Call yourself gender experimental! Call yourself 'Gender Weird'!\" and basically. TL;DR: I wanted help laying out the pieces of my puzzle, not be given bags to put the pieces in.\n\n\n\nI'm just. I just spend my days flip flopping on myself. One day I'm confident that yes, I'm genderqueer! It is a relief to call myself that! Isn't it great that I've finally figured out part of the puzzle?\n\n\n\nAnd then there are the days after, where I wake up feeling sick at the idea that I've actually told people I'm questioning my gender, feeling nothing but absolute guilt at opening this door because why would I? Aren't I Just A Girl? I'm cis, there's nothing else to it! I should never have started this conversation! What an embarrassing waste of peoples' time.\n\n\n\nBut there's. Just. Growing up, I wasn't particularly attached to either gender. I recognize that now. I was raised in a very accepting and welcoming home, with parents who have made mistakes from ignorance, not malice. Child me would wear dresses one day, and a shirt with bugs glued to it the next. Who cared? I was a small child. But I would also insist, fervently, that blue was my favorite color, because I knew that's a ~boy thing, and I wanted to be a bit more like a boy.\n\n\n\nSkip ahead a few years, and now I'm at the age everyone else starts dressing up, getting training bras, and exploring makeup. I didn't care. At all. I had way more important things going on, and I remember being very uncomfortable with my body's developments. Makeup was something I thought was silly, felt gross, and looked wrong on me. But most of all, I disliked 'dressing nice'. Dress felt fake. I felt like a fraud. Like a mistake. Wearing heels made me feel panic. 'Makeup' was unnatural and anxiety inducing.\n\n\n\nI avoided dressing up for quite a few years.\n\n\n\nSkip ahead more time. Now I've begun to force myself to wear dresses, skirts, asking to be bought push up bras because obviously large breasts are what I should aspire to have. A bit of makeup, though I'm yet to get any good at it. Yet it still feels wrong. I feel panicky and gross when wearing dresses. 'Dressing up' isn't enjoyable, it makes me want to cry.\n\n\n\nHowever, I am a girl, duh! Thus I should like this. I should wear these things. So I forced myself to.\n\n\n\nMore years ahead. I have a makeup collection, and have gotten pretty good at it! I dress extremely feminine some days. I own several heels. I've forced myself to dress up and warp my closet to the point it's not really an option anymore. And I think I made myself numb? I just made myself numb to the discomfort; I want to wear a straight cut jacket with nice pants and a stylish tie, but instead I wear fancy dresses and heels. Because. Just. It's how things ~should be, y'know?\n\n\n\nI know part of me is female. I know that. I accept that. That is an important part of my identity. But something else feels... off. Not every day. But some days. Some days I get Dressed Up and put on fancy makeup and wear heels and feel good. And then some days I do that and I feel sick. I want nothing but to scrub my face raw, tear the clothes off and toss out all of the makeup and all of the dresses, and just hide in my bed.\n\n\n\nExcept that's just. A really dramatic and honest version of it, since I scold myself whenever I have those feelings. Whenever I feel like that I force myself to just get through it.\n\n\n\nI don't really know what this post is anymore?\n\nJust.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone else feel this way? Please. I've been trying to find forums and posts and threads and just someone else who talks about 'Female+' but it seems you have to feel masculine/male at some point to truly not be a cis woman, but it's never been that way. It's always female and. Female + neutral.\n\n\n\nAm I just? A confused cis female who's maybe gender nonconforming, not gender queer?\n---\n\nThat's the post I made.\n\nTo be honest, I kinda felt relief when I found out about genderqueer/nonbinary identities. But. I don't really know anymore.

I wasn't comfortable wandering around as purely masculine anymore. \nHowever, a year on and I'm still having severe doubts as to my appearance. I could use some advice from the wonderful fonts of wisdom which are these subreddits. \n\nI identify as non-binary/androgynous. I once came across a label: 'masculine-androgen' and it resonated so beautifully in my understanding that I almost leaped to my feet and cheered at the time. To put numbers on it, I feel only 65% or so masculine if that makes sense, my feminine-self taking a less significant but undeniable chunk of space in my identity. The issue Ive been having is how to do justice to this new pillar of my identity. I am the only non-binary individual that I know of in my circle. All of my trans friends and family members are firmly in the binary. I've managed to cobble together core components to my appearance that make me feel comfortable but with no other NB people to speak to/compare notes with, I don't know if... I don't know whether I'm doing it wrong or not. Does that make sense? I suppose it doesn't when I come to think about it because everyone has their own unique outlook. But I really get uncomfortable wondering if everyone sees me as a circus.\n\nA brief description may be in order. The biggest components of my look are my breast forms. They were the element I knew from the get-go that were non-negotiable and which I needed to feel like the real me. They're matched to my build (maybe a little smaller) so they're not over-the-top (at least I don't think so). I'm growing my hair long and wear it in a ponytail and usually have a non-descript hairband in. On special occasions, I have a bow or colourful hairclips in or something, but only in and around the house. I shave as close as I possibly can but ultimately, I'm cursed with a very masculine frame (6 foot tall, large build, wide shoulders, strong core. I used to play rugby once upon a time so perhaps that gives you an idea what I'm forced to work with). \nI try to wear more feminine colours, tones, and styles to try and dilute the masculinity out a bit but it's really tough.\n\nAt a quick glance from the street, I suspect I appear as a \"bloke with boobs\" and I'm not especially happy with that due to the frequent looks and occasional abuse I get from strangers. I'm sure things can be refined, evened out. \n\nHow do you present? Am I unique in my current attempts? Any advice on clothing styles to explore etc? Does anyone have any stories which run in the same lanes as my own experiences?\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts.

I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m just another chick who wants to hang out with the guys, or that I want to be a special snowflake. \n\nI live in a liberal country that is not educated enough about the trans community. So everyone think they are accepting while in reality they really aren\u2019t. At least not in my case.\n\nBut I\u2019m okay with feminine pronouns and I can accept having a female body. At least for the most part. My true dysphoria is socially. I can\u2019t stand it when someone expects me to act feminine, or when other people gender me socially. I live in a male dominated world (I study computer science) and I have to prove myself twice as much to earn half the recognition. And if I don\u2019t act modest and timid then a lot of men tend to be disrespectful towards me. Asshats. They expect me to be so freakin caring and bat my eyelashes at them when I really want to call them an effin dickbag for treating me like their secretary. I\u2019m not sure if this is a problem for all genders, or if it\u2019s even gender related. But I hear a lot of women complaint about similiar things, so I draw my conclusions.\n\nSo just because no one believes me I\u2019ve considered just not coming out at all. The only thing I would REALLY want to change is my name, but I can\u2019t really do that since the name I\u2019d choose is 99.9% male name from Finland (I wonder who that 0,1% person was) and it would be weird for other people to call me that unless I transitioned completely. So I\u2019m going to just do my own thing, then. I\u2019m going to act and dress masculine when I feel like it, or even feminine if I want to. I don\u2019t need to explain myself, as it\u2019s nobody\u2019s buisness. Tomorrow I am going to get that tie with pineapples on it that I really want.

I'm not sure if I experience dysphoria or not. Here's a list of reasons I'm questioning. If anyone can relate or if I sound a certain way please let me know, I know my own subconscious tends to push back on my questioning and brush it aside so I don't know if I'm just blind to the obvious or if it's as ambiguous as I think. So here's a few things just off the top of my head.\n\n* I have always hated my name, it's too girly for me\n* Usually when I wear makeup I feel awkward, I honestly FEEL like I look like a man wearing makeup even though I know I don't. Same thing goes for wearing dresses and other \"girly\" clothes.\n* I'm pretty short and thin but view myself as larger than I am. It catches me off guard when people make references to my size. Possibly because I work out a lot and even though I'm still small, only I can see the progress I've made compared to how I used to look.\n* I work in a male-dominated field and sometimes when I speak at work my voice catches me off guard because I expect it to be deeper. Not sure if this is dysphoria or just me wanting to fit in, but it feels significantly weird emotionally\n* I have downloaded apps trying to see how I would look with a buzz cut and facial hair... they all sucked for what it's worth\n* Previously when I've let myself think about possibly being trans or GNC I've found myself thinking that if only I was taller it would be much easier to make a decision, I guess I'm hesitant about being such a little dude\n* A while ago I was at a festival trying to find a bathroom, ended up in some restaurant using the men's room because whoever was in the women's was taking too long. The door didn't have a lock but I had to pee too bad to care. A guy ended up opening the door without knocking and retreated upon seeing me but I could hear him yell \"THERE'S A GIRL IN THERE\"... it's really hard to explain but this freaked me out. Kinda feels like I forget I'm a girl and when others see me as one I am confused or just feel weird and somewhat bummed about it.\n* My self-esteem regarding my attractiveness is strong enough to where I occasionally wonder if I'm actually narcissistic lol, but if someone calls me pretty I feel like I don't trust it... I have been called handsome a couple of times and though I was confused about why they chose that word, I felt pretty fly\n* (nsfw) At least 9 out of 10 times when I jerk off I'm imagining myself with a penis.\n* When I was younger I played a couple MMO's and on each one had two accounts, one was a female character and one was male \n* As a kid I remember praying that I would wake up the next day as a boy.\n* Related to how I hate my name: I also remember thinking that I would be happy as a boy even with any name, even ones I didn't like, like \"Guy\" (lol?).\n* Also, I remember feeling disappointed as a kid because in my opinion, men couldn't be ugly but women had to work hard to be pretty. For what it's worth, I'm bisexual and also no longer hold this opinion, lol. But my response to it back then was that I was so jealous that I'd prefer being a man to working hard to be pretty.\n* Lastly, being bisexual I do date men and women and somehow I feel more gay when I'm with a man.\n\nI realize that I'm probably not cis at least but something in me is so opposed to exploring beyond that, so this is me trying to get over that. I don't know how, or if I would ever want to, tell anyone else about being anything other than cis. I have long hair and aside from not wearing much makeup and avoiding blatantly feminine clothes I don't think anyone would ever think that I'm questioning this unless I've opened up to them about little things here and there and they thought too much about it. I'm not sure why but I'm nervous to talk to anyone in real life about it. I already posted this in the \"questioning\" subreddit but I wanted to put it here too in case anyone nonbinary can relate or if people think I just sound trans or what. If it's not cool to post in multiple subs please let me know, I don't use reddit aside from lurking on other subs until now so I apologize if that's considered spamming.\n\n\nThanks to anyone who is down to try and help me out.", "date": "2018-02-06 22:38:08", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vrba2/afabquestioning/", "author": "cornSignificance"}, {"title": "Got Caught Twinning with my Bitmoji Today...", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-02-06 23:26:04", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vrnma/got_caught_twinning_with_my_bitmoji_today/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Agender + coming out into the world at last \u2764", "text": "", "date": "2018-02-07 00:13:39", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vrz2k/agender_coming_out_into_the_world_at_last/", "author": "nrh2005"}, {"title": "Is it weird that I mainly feel chest dysphoria when I'm not wearing a shirt?", "text": "Does anyone else feel this way?", "date": "2018-02-07 00:17:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vrzzc/is_it_weird_that_i_mainly_feel_chest_dysphoria/", "author": "Slapmewithaneel"}, {"title": "THIS came in my mail today from the Washington Department of Health!", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-02-07 01:48:31", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vslfo/this_came_in_my_mail_today_from_the_washington/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Got THIS in the mail from Washington Department of Health Today!", "text": "", "date": "2018-02-07 01:50:27", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vslva/got_this_in_the_mail_from_washington_department/", "author": "InkedFutureNullo"}, {"title": "It's Tie Tuesday!", "text": "", "date": "2018-02-07 03:15:31", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7vt5bi/its_tie_tuesday/", "author": "NeitherBoth"}, {"title": "Just had a question", "text": "Hi there!

It looks like \"aporagender\" might suit me well! It's a relief to have a more specific word. :D Thank you all for your help!\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nHey all! First time posting on this site. Please pardon any missteps.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI'm looking for help finding a word for my gender.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nGoing through questioning gave me a much better understanding of my gender, but I'm still left looking for a way to get that understanding across without writing out paragraphs. XD I'd like to find a word for my gender identity that's more specific than 'nonbinary' alone (which is what I currently use) but not too obscure, and I'm running into trouble.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThere may not be a non-obscure word, and that's okay! Nonbinary is better than nothing, and I don't want to end up with a term I'll just have to end up re-explaining anyway.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf I try to describe my gender, could anyone tell me if they know any terms off the top of their head that might fit? (Not looking for anyone to do research on my behalf!)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nMy gender is:\n\n- a \"positive\" sense of gender (not as in \"good,\" more as in \"testing positive\"; I'm not agender, and terms like \"void\" don't describe my sense of gender)\n\n- a single, discrete gender (not bigender/multigender, not experienced as a mix of genders)\n\n- static (neither fluid nor flux)\n\n- neither binary male nor binary female (and not significantly aligned with either)\n\n- unrelated to gender roles/expression/etc\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI have physical dysphoria along transmasc lines (I'm AFAB), but I don't think I could be considered transmasculine because I don't feel like my gender is close enough to male. While I know that if I complete the transition steps I want, I might be read as male, that's more a side effect of the steps instead of a goal. (I'd rather be read as *neither* binary gender, but no one would automatically think \"neither\" rather than \"idk which,\" so I might as well try to relieve my physical dysphoria and take whatever comes.)\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nI also don't see my gender as \"neutral,\" particularly because whenever I see that word come up, it seems to overlap with being agender or otherwise lacking in gendered feeling. That's the opposite of my experience. I don't have \"nothing\" just because it's \"neither\".\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIf I had to put my gender on a line between \"man\" and \"woman,\" then I'd say it'd be in the middle, but I don't perceive it as half-and-half or anything like that. It exists in relation to binary genders but remains its own, discrete thing. My experience of gender is not a duality or a mix. Sort of like how, even though I developed from a combination of my parents' genes, my sense of self arising from that physical combination is not \"half-Mom, half-Dad.\" I'm related to them, but a separate individual. Or like baking a cake: can't make it without the ingredients, but a piece of cake is not the same as having eggs and flour and such, and you wouldn't be able to get eggs back out of a baked cake.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSo, any ideas or comments?

But I'm not a gay man, because I do like women. I'm pretty sure I'm bisexual, but haven't had the chance to confirm (but I don't crave it either so that's okay).\n\nI'm also pretty sure I'm not a transwoman because trying to become an actual woman to me just sounds like locking myself further into a different form, and if at all I'd want more freedom, not less, and not \"the same freedom in different options after great toil and irreversible procedures\".\n\nI think I'm not a crossdresser because well, I've never felt an urge to crossdress. I'd like to be able to wear some girlier clothes as a normal thing; but I don't want to split myself and I'm not into wearing dresses, blouses or makeup - just as I'm not into wearing suits, ties, or having a beard. So yeah, doing strongly gendered stuff just puts me off. \n\nSeriously, it's like some dial in my head has always been misaligned by a notch, or got knocked off at some point, not by a huge amount but by a small-yet-noticeable-amount that shows itself almost everywhere sooner or later.\n\nSAGE said that I \"socialize androginously\" and the combined whatever inventory for MtFs called me \"androgyne\" (and kinda shrugged to the point that a digital self-report test can shrug) - For what that kind of thing is worth.\n\nTrying to look at myself as non-binary, or just as \"other\" gives me a drive to be more in control of my body and to do things that before I just didn't see the point of doing, BOTH boy-coded and girl-coded things.  It makes me look forward.\n\nI'm started to feel convinced it just makes a whole lot more sense.\n\nAnd now, for those that read the whole thing, here's a little joke translated from my mother tongue:\n\nThere are three babies awake in the neonatal unit of a hospital.\nLooking at the immediate surroundings, one of the babies says: \"Hey, looks like I'm a boy, because they gave me blue socks!\", which prompted the next baby to say \"And they gave me pink socks, so I guess I'm a girl?\". After a while, the third baby chimes in with great consternation: \"Guys, I'm fucked.

So I came out to my boss (approx 30ish) and an older coworker (probs 45?). I just plainly presented myself, acknowledging my physical presentation bc I tend to feel more comfortable in Masc business casual clothes. I stated what my gender identity and sexuality were and the fact that I\u2019m pretty strongly rooted in the LGBTQ+ population. \n\nFast forward to last week. My boss took an opportunity when we were alone to kinda confirm my sexuality since she was confused. It was humble and appropriate and I felt respected. No stress. \n\nYesterday, my coworker told me that she and my supervisor had to google what \u201cnon binary is\u201d and it resulted in an EXTREMELY uncomfortable and unexpected conversation with someone who is entirely disconnected from the LGBTQ community. She flip flopped between \u201cmy generation just doesn\u2019t care about bedroom business\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m just so curious, how do they do it?\u201d (In reference to trans acquaintances.)

I don\u2019t think any of the conversation was meant to be combative. I just didn\u2019t anticipate having this conversation with an adult and not a student with ASD who would struggle to understand \u201cgrey\u201d in their very black vs white world. Those conversations have been fine, probably because they weren\u2019t blindsiding. \n\nSo, friends, are there any good resources out there to help enbys who want to be themselves and educate others without reinventing the wheel?

I spent a few more years ignoring the confusion and just trying to get by in life, and not really thinking about why I felt so deeply annoyed with being perceived as female all the time. Now, after returning to school and meeting a whole bunch of young adults who have all these wonderful new words to describe gender, I feel like I'm starting to be a lot more honest with myself and my own gender. With that comes a lot of that old dysphoria I'd learned to shove deep into the closet again. \n\nBut I'm also not a guy. I learned that already. I'm a person who should have a beard, a deep voice, and a ballin makeup game, but doesn't. \n\nI still fluctuate between masc and femme. But I've been wanting more and more to go on T, I have a queer doctor now who would happily make that happen if I talked to her about it, and I'm very conflicted. While I know I'd feel happy if the entire world was a Queer Island and I could go anywhere being my sparkly, bearded self, I'm terrified of the reality of violence against trans women and feminine men, and I know from experience it is safer in some ways to be a masculine-presenting woman than it is to be a feminine-presenting man; it is somewhat safer to be a trans man than a trans woman; and I'm familiar with the territory of safety I have as the body I currently own.

I'm starting to believe I'm not strictly cis, but I'm not sure how far across the aisle I truly identify, yet.\n\nI finally had some free time to socialize with a close friend, the other day. It doesn't happen often, anymore! We've known each other forever. \n\nAs we were catching up, I felt great vibes coming from the conversation, and I suddenly felt like sharing a little more than the usual 'guy' fluff. I started by saying, I'd decided to focus on self improvement this year, and that I'd decided to try therapy, since it was covered by insurance.\n\nHe was intrigued and excited; asked me how I liked it so far?  He'd had rough times in the past, and had thought seeing someone would have helped. \n\nI told him it was great! I was having fun, finding ways to improve my marriage and be more empathetic. I told him... I'd been feeling sort of confined by stereotypical masculinity.\n\n...That's it.\n\n* I didn't tell him I was questioning my gender.\n* I didn't tell him I might be trans or non-binary.\n* I didn't tell him I was curious about hormones.\n\n-even though I am, to all of those things. Just a *sliver* of a hint: \"I'm feeling a little trapped by masculinity.\"\n\nHe immediately agreed; \"yeah, man! They even have a name for it now: 'toxic masculinity,' right? It's all bullshit, trying to tell boys they can't have feelings. I know how you feel!\"\n\nAnd then we played some more video games. We spent the day hanging out, chatting and playing games. When it was time to head back to work life, we brought it in for a hug.\n\nI realized I don't hug friends enough. \n\nIt's not much, but it felt good to share just a hint and have it so well received.  It felt validating, even though it was just brushing the surface.

I wanted to post and made another post asking if that would be alright, and people seemed like they wouldn't mind, so here it is. Let it be known that this does contain mentions of my encounters with truscum and my extremely low confidence. Also, cripplepunk and queercrip are political identities I ascribe to; I'm disabled (a \"crip\"). (End note.) \n\n\n\u2014 \n\nWrite about your gender. \n\n... \n\nMy gender is James. I have always been James, I think. Or maybe they grew up out of the fresh earth decayed from Lex or Wander or Deadname. I do not know, I can't find out. I do not care. \n\nJames is now. James is this year. James is candor and pain and scary conversations about pronouns and how much 'James' I can be. \n\nJames is a one-syllable word with the same first letter of my deadname. It is also the name of a (in my opinion) flamboyantly genderqueer character from the Pok\u00e9mon anime. It is my name. I chose it in thirty seconds, tops. And now people call me that. I think I like it. \n\nJames calls themself male, but really, they're not. Body dysphoria or whatever aside ('cause who cares honestly), deep down, James sexually identifies as a punk. Not a girl, not a boy, not a xeumel or the other X-words people have put a lot of thought into. Just a punk. \nEven though you don't need to be a punk to be a CripplePunk, I'm both. My gender is CripplePunk, is Queercrip, is identity politics no matter what. \n\nThat's probably unhealthy, isn't it? \n\nI don't care. \n\nI am James. My skin is pallor-white and laced with starry scars from things I cannot talk about. My body is webbed and curved and bony, but as I wait I feel it getting softer. I am excited to feel myself growing layers of squish, of fat, of forgiveness. It makes me proud. \n\nMy personality is quite shit. I've been told that many times by people who also have quite shit personalities, but also by people who are quite nice or in between. I don't really care. I'm an extrovert, but years of parental neglect has made other people's opinions on my character not really matter to me. I can get by with a few very little love kernels from people I like. \n\nI don't need many validation kernels for my gender either. Being called a girl doesn't even hurt anymore. It just feels numb. Maybe it carries a faint hot stinging that radiates up from my chest for half a second and then dissipates. Sometimes being called a boy does that too. I mean, I like \"male\" terms sometimes \u2014 boyfriend, husband, 'sir' maybe. Things that used to make me quake from happiness sometimes still feel quite nice. But it's all relative. \n\nNow I feel euphoric when I'm called \"Mx.\" James has been writing this poem in a mixture of first and third person because they like when people use they/them pronouns, it feels sharp and clear and like something other than the numb 's/he's I have convinced myself I don't care about. \n\nI mean, if someone must err, I'd rather they erred on the side of \"he\" rather than \"she.\" \"He\" is what I will one day settle for, when I am an adult who speaks a gendered language. I am sure one day it will feel acceptable. \n\nBut back when I still felt euphoria, I felt it for my queerness, for my certainty and freedom granted within for all eternity by my enbyhood. For that one day, it glittered, it ached. It was\u2014 \n\nIt was everything I knew and everything I wanted, stitched into my skin and plastered onto me, into me, crochet and braided lanyards and embroidered tapestry all at once, \nAll over me, inescapable \u2014 \nMx., They/them \n\nI'm such a loser \n(And I don't care! Or at least, I'm trying not to.) \n\n\n\nBut the mocking internal voice of my \"true transsexual\" scum former self makes it feel ridiculous, impossible, illegitimate and pointless to desire \nSo when it's not respected, should I care? \nDo I even have a right to? \nIf I am one in a hundred, one in a thousand, one in a something and my feeling is unique and unnameable and psychotic and unreal (?\u00bf?), does it count at all? \nMaybe so, maybe not \nI don't care \nI am too scared to talk about it still \n\nAnd yet, and yet, I hope every day that somebody will acknowledge it \nI hope day after day, like I did before, and it never happened, never happens \nThat's okay \nIt's time to leave it \nFor another day.

I didn't know who I was, and I finally realized I was lesbian and came out..  Life got so much brighter, and so much made sense.  It felt amazing, and I just all around felt better.   I don't really like labels, and have never got into the classifications of the \"type\" of lesbian I am.  I am just me.\nAnywho, lets fast forward.  I have always hated my boobs, and tend to wear a very tight sports bra to hide them.  I know I am absolutely comfortable and love being a woman, and I love boobs...just not on me and not my own.  I enjoy wearing boys clothes (tomboy classification I guess), and I also like to wear makeup and sometimes paint my nails.  I am not always comfortable in \"girly clothes,\" but will wear them even if i'm not comfortable. obviously, I strive and support everyone to be who they are now and always have been.  I am a million percent fine with being a lesbian, and support anyone that is who they are and who they always have been.\nI fell in love with my best friend of almost 5 years, and we are now together.

I am truly lucky.  she loves getting cute for not only me, but for herself.  I absolutely love when she does, and thought I would get cute for her.  so I bought a couple skirts and a couple outfits.  I couldn't bring myself to wear them.  it just felt uncomfortable.  I finally put one on for her, and felt so uncomfortable when I did.  she thought it was cute and loved it.  however, I felt meh and out of place.  she knows all of my deepest thoughts, struggles, etc...she asked me one night: gf \"don't get mad, but I want to ask you a question\"\nme \"go ahead and ask, it would be hard for me to get mad at you for asking me a question\"\ngf \"I've known you for a long time..have you ever wondered or thought about you being gender queer?\"\nI had never been asked that, nor really looked into it.

It read as follows:\n\n&gt; A torrid romance ensues between a beautiful young workingwoman and a handsome entrepreneur. \n\nOK, the \"beautiful young workingwoman\" trope is nauseating enough. But what jumped out at me was that users are supposed to instinctively link \"handsome\" with male; the author of the blurb considers the terms to be synonymous. Yep, most dictionaries also make this association (I'm looking at you [*OED* online](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/handsome)). However, dictionaries evolve at glacial speeds, rarely keeping up with so called informal changes to language. I mean handsome as used to describe someone as good looking has been problematic gender wise for decades (at least in some circles). Admittedly, the *OED* online does also define handsome as, \"(of a woman) striking and imposing rather than conventionally pretty.\" This latter definition doesn't save the word from criticism as it stands as a gendered term (though I am wondering whether it would be considered an awesome compliment to receive by some non-male identifying people). But it does show there are other definitions of the word, and therefore not exclusively synonymous with male.

I think I may be one of you. May I introduce myself?", "text": "Hello /r/NonBinary,\n\nIt's a long story, but I think that I may be one of you.  Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.  Maybe I'm something else.\n\nIf I am, I am not properly \"out\" to anyone.  There are a lot of haters in my family, and coming out could be dangerous. (but I'm sure it is for most anyone)\n\nAnyhow, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.  (I previously wrote this if you want to read more about me: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/80fqhd/not_sure_what_i_am_what_do_you_think/)\n\nI've always been a bit odd and I've never fit it very well.  As a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD, but as an adult with access to better information, it's clear to me that I am high-functioning autistic.  I used to fear that I would grow old alone and without family and friends, but I was super lucky to meet a wonderful lady who learned to love me the way I am (mostly) and she became my wife and the mother of my child.  I love her dearly.\n\nI think it is relevant that I have always been exclusively attracted to women sexually and I am deeply committed to my monogamous marriage.\n\nI've always thought of myself as a guy.  However, I sometimes feel urges to behave femininely, and sometimes I wish I could appear more feminine.  (I've actually been chastised by closed-minded family members for this)  I wrote in the thread I linked above that I sometimes feel what I would describe as an unhealthy envy of women's bodies, which I suspect is related to sexual health issues and possibly influenced by pornography.  I was disappointed to read that it typically costs over 10,000 USD for a man to have his beard permanently removed.\n\nI spoke to my wife about my interest in cross-dressing as a sexual fetish.  She was rather put off by it.  She made some remark that she was afraid of me turning into Caitlyn Jenner.  I do not see myself being like Caitlyn.  The way I would explain that is that Caitlyn is a trans-woman.  She identifies herself as a women.  I see myself identifying as someone who has a female identity alongside my male identity.  I can't see myself ceasing to identify with my masculine roles of husband and father.  Being a father means the world to me.  Still, my wife made it very clear to me that she cannot be married to a woman.  She said that if I become a woman, \"we can be friends\".  Perish the thought!  I do not want my child raised without myself as the father.\n\nSo what about clothes?  Without my wife's knowledge, I ordered a pair of tunic dresses online.  They arrived yesterday.  I wanted to keep this to myself.  The delivery came while my wife was giving the child a nap.  Feeling a sense of shame that I was hiding something, I stuck a note on the door: \"no doorbell, please\".  The package arrived during the nap and I carefully discarded the note and stuck the package in the back of a filing cabinet.  I tried on the dresses after my wife and child had retired for the night.\n\nI really hate that I'm keeping this secret.  I just don't know how I can explain this to my wife and what she'll think.\n\nI enjoyed trying on my new clothes, but I felt sad that at least for now, I can only wear them by myself.  One of my dresses is a pleated dress with a floral print.  It fits me very well and helps fill my urge to appear feminine (not that I feel the need to appear feminine 24/7)\n\nOne thing I really love about this dress is that with its long sleeves, I can wear it with leggings and cover up almost 100% of my masculine body hair.  I think that my muscles would also look ridiculous sticking out of a sleeveless dress.  Trying to look androgynous is not for the faint of heart!  I feel like I'm actually rather smart about this!  I also like the fact that the pleats tend to conceal my masculine spare tire and my novice tucking job.  It's actually about perfect for an AMAB non-binary!\n\nThe other thing that bugs me is this:  My wife used to tease me for being girly.  I used to take it in stride.  I thought that it was a \"shit test\" that I had become very comfortable with passing.  One day, I said to her, \"You know, I think you're on to something.  I think that there is a girly side to me, and from now on, I won't hold back from feeling it and expressing it.\"  She never teased me that way again.  I feel wistful thinking about it.\n\nAnother thing is that I've finally acted on my urge to grow my hair out.  It's about 3 inches long and very curly.  Family and friends have always urged me to keep it short because they think it looks handsome and manly that way.\n\nSee, if I were a trans-woman, I suspect I would be wanting to taking female hormones and present as a woman 100% of the time, but that isn't who I am.  But at the same time, I feel stifled by not being able to express myself femininely in demeanour and appearance.  So, I suspect that I might fall into some sort of non-binary category.  Hence, I suspect that I am one of you.\n\nMy top concern right now is that I want to feel comfortable in my own skin, and I don't want to become something that my wife doesn't want anymore.  I think she should be able to accept me as non-binary, but I don't know how to explain it to her.", "date": "2018-03-01 17:42:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj/amab_new_here_i_think_i_may_be_one_of_you_may_i/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "I think I look androgynous.

(Cross-posting from r/genderqueer)", "text": "Okay, diving in. I'm 35 years old and assigned male at birth. I decided I was gay when I was around 10 and changed that to queer a few years ago \u2014 partly because I realized not everyone I'm attracted to identified as a man and partly because I felt increasingly alienated from mainstream cis gay men. I'm not entirely sure when I first began to wonder if I'm not a cis man myself but I began to consider the question in earnest a few months ago. I found the possibility surprisingly exciting and there seemed to be ample evidence.\n\nSome examples of that evidence: - I've never felt very comfortable in designated male spaces (locker rooms, men's bathrooms, etc.) and I've never particularly enjoyed being considered \"one of the guys\" as it seemed an awkward fit. - At High School, all my friends were women (though as an adult it's been all gay men) and I've always hated sports and recoiled from traditionally masculine behavior. - In recent years, I've grown increasingly bored with much of the clothing marketed to men; it's often repetitively styled, limited to plain colors and patterns, and generally downright boring. I've been searching out more color, florals, and unusual patterns to the point of incorporating some \"women's\" clothing into my wardrobe. - For a while now I've found myself fantasizing about living in a society with indigenous/precolonized gender roles because then I could \"just have a sensible third gender.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I've packed a lot of that into the gay identity but as I got older and \"gay\" began to be more clearly differentiated as strictly a sexual orientation I've wondered where that left my gender nonconforming behavior. I got by with \"queer\" for a while. But then something changed.\n\nOne drunken weekend night about a month ago, I shared with my husband that I wondered if I wasn't some flavor of nonbinary. The next day I thought about how I'd blame the booze and walk that back...and then I didn't. Instead, I told more people, and began actively exploring the possibility. The results have been encouraging. I bought more clothing marketed to women and started finding opportunities to wear more gender-mixed attire. I reopened my ear piercings from my 20s and started wearing all kinds of earrings. I've spent so much at Sephora, I've probably put them into the black for the year. I've been enjoying the hell out of all of this. I really like when my appearance feels like a mashup of different gender expressions. I've started having little moments of unexpected delight, like when I see my lipstick imprint on a glass of wine. Once when I came home from work and stripped off my traditionally-male work clothes, I somehow felt better just being naked. Sometimes I look at my cis male friends and mentally set myself aside as another gender and feel a sense of relief to no longer be comparing myself to them.\n\nI've spoken to some trans acquaintances \u2014 including a nonbinary person \u2014 and a lot of this sounded familiar to them. One even said outright, \"sweetie, you're not cis.\" The writing does appear to be on the wall at this point but I suppose I still have doubts. Thirty-five seems awfully late to discover something this big about myself. I'm fine with my body the way it is (though I wouldn't mind getting it in a little better shape). And I'm not sure I've always felt this way. Looking back, there are possible hints but it still feels a bit like it's come out of the blue and that doesn't really sound like so many of the trans narratives I've read. Is it possible that the seeds of this were always there, dormant because of internalized misogyny or whatever, until I nurtured them and now they're blooming? Or have I just...changed? Have I been confusing who I am with who I'm attracted to until now? Does it even matter or is it possible something else is going on and I'm misattributing it? I asked my husband, \"What if I'm not nonbinary and I just want to be?\" and he asked \"What's the difference?\"\n\nSo, yeah.\n\nTL; DR: I think I'm nonbinary or genderqueer (still not entirely sure what the differences is) but it seems to have come out of nowhere compared to so many others' experiences so I have doubts.", "date": "2018-03-02 23:14:31", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/81jog2/hi_im_new_to_reddit_and_new_to_questioning_my/", "author": "MxToYou"}, {"title": "Join our Non-Binary Discord for chats and fun!!

I'm afab (20) and kinda confused if nonbinary/demigirl fits better than female. I started not feeling totally fine with identifying as a woman since more than a year now I guess, back then I didn't even knew much about non-conforming genders. I just noticed that comparing with my friend I don't feel that comfortable being a woman as her. There was kind of a part that wasn't male nor female. Before that I identified as a girl but never thought about it much. I came out as bi/pan last summer and got more into the local queer community and got to know some nb people. Since then my gender questioning got worse. \n\nEverytime we did an introduction round in queer circles with pronouns, mostly it felt wrong to use 'she'. When I needed to choose my gender in formulars, sometimes I don't want to tick the woman box. I feel most comfortable in sweater and jeans, but sometimes I also like skirts and dresses. Also I got into button-up shirts (and felt as if I look like a lesbian stereotype first). Recently I cut my hair short and I feel so much more like me. I never imagined that would be possible with short hair (it was pretty spontaneous). I like to present androgynous (except my face is really soft), but as soon as I look too masculine, it doesn't feel right. Also I don't like it to be mistaken a guy. But I also feel an aversion when someone calls me Miss whatever. I'm not totally sure but I would like to try to pronouns as they/them, xier, dey/dem etc. Also I was always glad that my nickname is gender neutral and I lost connection to my feminine whole name long ago.\nI'm kinda overweight and have pretty large breasts I ignore mostly. I would prefer small breastes I could hide easily if I wanted to. Also I would like to rip out my uterus, not just because bad cramps but it doesn't feel as a part of me. On the other side I'm pretty much fine with my outer genitalia. \n\nWriting all that down I feel lile the labels non-binary/demigirl fits, but my main concern is if it's just imagination because I want to be different as the other enbys in my community. I'm afraid I won't be taken serious and seem like I'm just following a \"trend\" kind of. That's also the reason I feel afraid to talk to anyone from the community. Also I know life is easier as a cis-woman in every aspect and being a enby of colour would make so many things more complicated and I'm afraid of that. \n\nAm I actually nonbinary or a demigirl or just a cis-woman that wants to be special?

(https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj)  This conversation and others have convinced me that I am non-binary in some way, and now I feel the need to tell others about what I feel.\n\nTo start out with, I need to be out with my wife, because one of the strongest indications of my non-binary identity is my frequent urge to wear feminine clothes (but I am certain that this is about more than clothes).  If I'm not out with her, my girl clothes are going to be sitting in the back of my filing cabinet with my tax papers until the day I drop dead.\n\nI previously wrote that my wife expressed apprehension that I might be a trans-woman and said to me very clearly that she could not be married to me if that's what I am.\n\nSo, the first thing that came to mind is the fear that she might give me an ultimatum to either dress, act, and identify as a cisgender male for the rest of my life or have a divorce and become an \"Uncle Dad\", writing a monthly check to her and seeing my child every other weekend.\n\nI don't think that the above is the likely outcome.  I think my coming out is likely to come as a shock to her, but I don't think she'd leave me or give me an ultimatum.\n\nHowever... There is something else that I'm afraid of.  As many of you probably did when you first discovered that you were non-binary, I feel like I don't know exactly how to express myself as non-binary, and some experimentation is in order.  I'm afraid that such experimentation will be heavily censured and stifled.\n\nI fear that she'll have a mindset (even perhaps being unaware of it) that will cause her to exert very strong pressure to conform to a traditional cisgender role upon me.  She might urge me to give up shaving body hair because I've been having trouble with ingrown hairs (yuck!)  She might steer me away from situations where I might express myself femininely.  She might tell our 3 year old that Daddy is going thru a phase.  She might frequently make comments about how nice my hair looks shorter.  As a matter of fact, she used to discourage me from growing my hair by making remarks about how much trouble it would be to dry and set my hair daily.\n\nThe funny thing is that she sometimes seems fascinated by transexual women, but when it comes to me, she wants me to conform conform conform because she's afraid of what people will think of me and of her, by association.  There are also potentially serious professional consequences.\n\nI was wondering if there are any married non-binaries here who could relate to any of these situations or perhaps warn me of other possibilities I need to be prepared for.\n\n**Edit:** I am AMAB", "date": "2018-03-04 04:09:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/81vh1b/afraid_of_how_my_wife_my_respond_to_my_coming_out/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "If you've had top surgery &amp; on HRT, do you identify as male on your ID?", "text": "Hi there, as an NB who identifies not as a man, but wants a masculine-presenting body, I wonder if I have to change my gender on my legal documents to male?

I want to change my middle name, too, but I'm not fully sold on one, yet.\n\nFor personal reasons, I would like my middle name to also start with an M. I would like a neutralish middle name, preferrably masculine-leaning as well.\n\nI have thought of Marius, which is more masculine than I'd like, and kind of a mouthful. My mother suggested Maren/Marin. It's supposedly gender neutral, but I've seen it listed as gender neutral AND exclusively female by some sources.\n\nI like the ring of Micah Maren (whether pronounced like Karen with an M or like mar-EEN) but I'm worried it sounds too feminine.\n\nDoes anyone have some input on this? Does Micah Maren [lastname] sound neutral? Feminine? Or is there a vetter neutral M name out there?\n\nSome have suggested just using my username,  since I go by that more amongst my friends than I do my new chosen name.

I'm currently a cis girl (AFAB), but lately I've been questioning my gender. My issue is that I feel that the ways I'm questioning my gender feel like 'false flags' that I'm just picking up on, maybe seeing something where there's nothing- if that makes any sense at all. My partner recently came out as MTF and I don't know if maybe I'm internalizing things and trying to copycat?? If that's even possible.\n\nI don't really feel any sort of physical dysphoria, except for my chest, only occasionally. Other times I feel absolutely euphoric and I feel comfortable with them. When I wear clothes like sweaters, I feel like my boobs are just popping out there for the world to see and it makes me feel weird and out of place. I've actually realized that's how I feel in a lot of my clothing. I've gotten some tighter-fitting bralettes that eased a lot of that feeling and make me feel good! I've considered a binder, but in my mind I feel like that would be transphobic? I don't know why. \n\nFollowing that point, I've never really felt comfortable in dresses. I've tried to wear them out, but I always feel out of place and like I'm doing something 'wrong' when I wear them. I like wearing them for my partner because she thinks they're cute, but that's about it.\n\nI used to be very against people using they/them pronouns to refer to me, but more recently they've been appealing to me and I've asked a few close friends to use she/they, since 'she' doesn't bother me, but I feel like 'they' would be comfortable for me, too! I went through a little period of time where I considered a more gender-neutral name, but I sort of dropped it for reasons. I don't think I'm uncomfortable with how I am socially perceived, but a lot of it is more how I perceive myself? \n\nWhen I was younger (like 12-13), I wrote some stuff in a journal that really made it seem like I was genderfluid, or maybe the idea of being able to switch between bodies was just...something that appealed to me as a preteen?? I don't know if that's a common feeling. I don't really feel like I'm 'missing' parts, but I don't know if I feel super attached to what I currently have, either. Which is fine! It doesn't cause dysphoria and it's not like I feel /totally/ 'meh' about them. I'm perfectly 'fine' having what I have. I don't feel like HRT is something I would want to pursue...I just like having shorter hair and pressing my chest in when I can, and gender neutral pronouns appeal to me.\n\nSo overall, I feel like maybe I'm blowing things out of proportion-- maybe I'm just a girl who leans a little demi, or is a little genderflux, which for some reason doesn't feel like it would justify calling myself nonbinary (absolutely no offense to anyone who ID's as demi- or -flux! It's a completely personal feeling about myself). Am I just a cis girl who is seeing something where there is nothing?? I feel very confident when I think of myself as nb versus cis, but I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with 'just being' cis. I don't really know how to process this stuff!

I had speech development delays growing up and I suffer from trauma from being bullied in middle school. Growing up, I had to be taught many things that come naturally to most people (mainly social stuff), so I grew up trying to conform to who I was told I should be instead of who I wanted to be. Even though I came out of the closet in high school and have generally been what I thought was the unapologetic me, I've been having significant doubts lately that this actually was the real me. I have come a long way since I first came out as gay in high school - I went from thinking I was masc (LOL what a joke), to kind of accepting that I wasn't but still wanted people to think I was a top (also totally hilarious), to accepting that I seem gay but still uncomfortable about it and still clinging to my boring cishet wardrobe, to deciding to get my first piercing and actually loving my queerness as opposed to just pretending to love it, to realizing that I'm not even a man. And this is where I am now. \n\nI have come out as nonbinary to my inner circle of friends and to the queer facebook group for my university. While most of my queer friends have been good about using they/them pronouns for me, the others literally haven't even tried, even though they were accepting and said they would. I think that part of the reason for this is that I didn't change my appearance at all after I came out. I know that your identity is your identity and you don't have to dress a certain way/act a certain way to prove that, but this has led me to realize that I don't have to conform to any stupid gender roles and I can do whatever I want, and that I truly want to figure out the real me, because I do know for sure that this isn't it. \n\nI have relied on other people for fashion advice and other things of that nature for so long because I grew up thinking that I was incapable of doing these things on my own without looking like an idiot. Toxic masculinity has taken its toll on me and I'm really trying to just break out of that once and for all. That leads to the point of this post:\n\nI have no idea where to start. I am planning on doing a wardrobe inventory and getting rid of a lot of stuff I don't need, but I don't know where to begin as far as experimenting with new styles. A couple of friends helped me buy makeup for the first time recently, but I don't know what to do with that (not that I don't know how to apply the makeup, but I don't know what works for me). I'm struggling with figuring out an appearance that is truly me, when trauma and toxic masculinity have been embedded into my being so much that I don't even know who the real me is. All I know is that I'm queer as fuck, nonbinary as fuck, and ready to embrace a new beginning for myself. But I literally have no idea where to start.

Some of us seem to be neither male nor female, and some of us seem to be equally both, some are more male than female, some are more female than male, and so on.\n\nI just wanted to express some of how I feel and see if anyone relates.\n\nThe earliest sign I can recall of my gender dysphoria is that when I took a music class in my early twenties, I really wished that I could sing like a female.  I wish that I could sing a soft, feminine lullaby or aria.  Of course, gender dysphoria was such a forbidden feeling to me up until recently that I would dare not admit this to anyone.\n\nI think I previously wrote about this, but there is something unhealthy about my sexuality.  I've consistently suffered from sexual difficulties including anorgasmia.  I used to have a girlfriend who seemed to be exceptionally gifted sexually; it seemed as if even gentle sexual contact brought her extreme ecstasy.  To add to my confusion, she told me that she believed that better orgasms were God's gift to women to compensate them for the pain of childbirth.  From this and other experiences, I believe that I feel an unhealthy envy of women's bodies.\n\nI can also tell you that growing up, my father taught me that women are the inferior sex, projecting irrational emotional behavior onto them.  Looking back, I think he is just insecure and narcissistic. He also rants that there is a conspiracy to \"feminize\" young men in the western world.\n\nI remember seeing the James Bond film \"Spectre\".  I was really disappointed.  I thought that it was an excrement sandwich that peaked in the scene where Blofeld tortured Bond by drilling holes in his head.  I thought that this was absolutely disgusting, not to mention that the acting was horrible and the whole scene was absurd.  As for my father, he told me that he disliked the movie because of the high-pitched male singing in the title song.\n\nAnyhow, what does that have to do with how I'm feeling right now?\n\nBy accepting myself as (potentially) non-binary, I've opened the floodgates to thoughts and intuitions where I see feminine parts of myself.  Basically, I think that I am largely male, but there is a powerful feminine part of myself that has been repressed all my life.\n\nThis part of myself... I'll call her Alice for now.  I don't know if I see Alice as feminine because she is actually feminine in a literal sense, or maybe Alice simply represents aspects of myself that seem feminine because of what I was taught about how a man should be growing up.  But whatever Alice is, she seems very good to me.  She is very gentle, tender, and loving.\n\nHere's another thing.  I have an imaginary friend.  About a year ago, before I came out as non-binary, I asked her to come up with a special name to call me by.  She chose a feminine name for me.  I was a bit shocked and uncomfortable, but she has not called me by any other name since that day.  Whenever I close my eyes and imagine myself with her, we both have female bodies in my imagination.\n\nI have this urge to grow out my hair and wear feminine clothes, which I've been experimenting with at home.  I'm going to come out to my hair stylist next time I see her.\n\nThe biggest thing right now is that sometimes, when I see (non-sexual) fan art of some of my favorite female roleplaying characters, especially when they look happy and playful, I can't help but wish that I could be like them and have a body like them, to be so happy and carefree (even if I know that said characters are actually burdened with having to save the world).  I feel a sense of euphoria at imagining myself in a female body sometimes, but at the same time, I am still very attached to the masculine roles I play in my life.\n\nI still remain exclusively attracted to females, romantically and sexually.  Sometimes, I wonder if that might change if I get into a more feminine mindset in the future as a result of my exploration and experimentation.  I am in a committed heterosexual marriage and I certainly do not want to blow that up.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, I think that in the future, I'm going to make my appearance more androgynous or may be like a \"girly man\", as you might call it.\n\nI just wanted to give words to my feelings.

And as far as I could research it, in the UK at least, they are legally a grey area where it is ok to have them just like you can have a fake number plate that has your name on it and hang it in your bedroom - but you can't use a fake ID to buy alcohol when you are underage, open a bank account, or stick that fake registration plate on your car and leave your driveway without breaking the law.\n\nThe only thing that I want to be 'different' on these IDs is my first name, gender (yeah I know it still has to be binary, but I'm almost never the gender on my real ID) and the picture would be different to suit. I'm over 22 already so have no need to lie about my age or other things. I would never use this to get a bank account, show it to police if they pulled me over, to an employer when they want proof I can legally be here etc. Only shop keepers, door staff in bars/clubs/hotels - things that don't matter much.\n\nSo I wonder has anyone every tried one of those services (in UK or elsewhere)?

So I transitioned from male to female a little over 2 years ago now. When I first started transitioning I initially started labeling myself as bigender but eventually decided that I identified as a female because of dysphoria over my more male features, and honestly a little bit of fear over being nonbinary.

I have friends I love, I'm happy in myself, and I feel like I'm truly alive in the world. But I haven't been feeling the connection and identification with the women I know that I thought that I would. I mean I certainly don't feel it with men and I certainly connect more with the women I know, but I don't find myself feeling the same as them and I guess it freaks me out a little. Like my physical dysphoria is gone  but now I just feel out of place and without a place. Iguess I feel scared and embarrassed by this because I transitioned all this way and have been telling everyone I'm on the binary.

My mental health is passable for the first time in a long time, there's no conflict within my group of friends, my mom (who was diagnosed with stage 4 IBC 18 months ago) is doing better than anyone could have asked so there's nothing going on internally within my family, and I have a job decent enough that I don't absolutely need another.

I am a trans girl and I recently moved countries. It is really great here as there are lots of trans related support activities.

Great I like it, it's fine. However, I am one of only two \"binary\" femmes, and then there is one trans femme nonbinary (everyone else is trans masculine or a trans man).  So, I often leave group meetings trying to place myself in relation to other people. While it seems like some are gender fluid, many of the other people skew towards masculine or feminine. When they describe why they feel they are nonbinary, the reason is usually something along the lines of \"I feel my identity as having male and female aspects, just more towards one side.\" Cool, so do I. I am not a very binary focused person and I am sure that many of my traits are not traditionally femme. But then again, the same is true of my cis partner. I guess my question is the preference, in some cases, against the language of \"man\" and \"woman\"? Is the preference for the nonbinary label an act against let's call it gender rigidity, seeing binary gender a fixed? In which case, my identity differs only really in my choice of labels. I see myself and most people as being on a spectrum I just feel like I can stick with \"woman\"\u2014which is how my body feels\u2014and reject the arbitrarily assigned roles and shitty baggage.

It was awful, but then it wasn't.", "text": "My context: I identify as agender/nonbinary and usually present neutrally. People tend to read me as female unless I make an effort to present in a very masculine way. I live in an area with a decent queer population but not a ton of trans awareness, so most people tend to read me as a butch lesbian without thinking gender identity might be relevant to my presentation. I'm usually ok with that, since I also identify with dyke culture to some degree and I'm the sort of agender person who finds it seriously ironic that not identifying with the concept of gender means I end up explaining gender to people all the time, so I don't mind just not having the conversation. But... you will understand that this is a compromise that can lead to uncomfortable situations.\n\nI get my hair cut at a little local barbershop. Good barber shops are among my favorite things. This is a traditional shop in many ways: no hipster stuff, no brews on tap, no fancy styling, just a trained barber who gives me a solid $10 haircut that looks exactly like I want it to every time. But it's also not the kind of shop that has Playboy mags in the waiting area. I have always experienced it as a friendly space with good banter.\n\nSo, I'm in there a couple days ago for my usual shearing, and there is a group of several guys ahead of me all getting cuts, with two guys left in line. They're just having typical bro conversation and leaving me alone while I do introvert things on my phone and wait... until the last guy in line sits down for his cut. This guy starts going off about how much he hates... well, just about everything I value, actually. There are plenty of Trumpsters on the fringes of this city, so I'm used to hearing/ignoring a lot of this. But when he starts in on trans issues, saying things like \"there's just no moral decency left in the world any more\" and \"if you're a human, you can't just up and be an airplane\" and \"they're gonna try to get rid of real men and women and take over\" and \"it's Sodom and Gomorrah out there,\" I feel the blood starting to drain from my face, my heart rate rising, that floating feeling coming on... all that fun triggery stuff. \n\nHe's leaving no room for anyone else to speak, and I wish I could jump in, but I don't feel safe--I'm surrounded by this dude's bro friends in a small shop without a whole lot of other people nearby. I assume this is not directed at me; he has probably read me as female, as most people do; he also hasn't said anything about gay issues, which would be less socially acceptable to rant about in this city, so I think he's just an oblivious asshole rather than a deliberate troll. I know that if I say anything, I'll out myself. I physically can't make myself speak. I feel myself trying to make my body small. I'm staring at the same text message on my phone unable to read the words, angry with him for thinking it's ok to blast like this and angry with myself for being unable to do anything but keep breathing. I finally get to the point where I think I should just leave. But I need a haircut, and I've waited a while, and I don't want to let this guy chase me out of my usual barber shop.\n\nFinally, he pauses his rant long enough to ask the barber, \"Do you know what I mean, man?\" And the barber says, \"No, I really don't know what you mean. I don't agree with anything you just said. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think your opinion is wrong. Hey, I'm done--do you want to look at the back?\"\n\nAnd the guy just stops talking, pays, and leaves with his whole group. \n\nI then get the reliable haircut I came for. There isn't as much bantering with the barber as there usually would be, since I'm still coming down from what just happened. Again, I feel I want to say something, but I can't. I have all these conflicting feelings. I would have liked for him to step in and stop the guy from going off like that before it happened, but that's not his job any more than it is mine. He has no clue I am trans any more than the random guy, so he probably thought those words weren't hurting anyone who was actually present. But they were, and I do wish he would have taken that extra step to make his shop feel safe for everyone. \n\nBut on the other hand, the second he replied the way he did, I felt so incredibly relieved, like the weight just lifted. I don't care what a random asshole thinks. I do care that my barber doesn't agree with him, and I give him credit for saying so, and it did shut the guy up when he did--just a little late. I'm grateful to him and a little resentful towards him all at once, which of course makes me feel greedy for wanting just a little more than I got. He could have said nothing at all, and I would still be triggered, and I might have just walked out. But instead I feel safe again and I got my hair cut.\n\nWhen it's time to pay, I tip well (as always), and I say, \"This is for today's haircut. The next time I come in, that will be for what you said to that guy.\" He shakes my hand and smiles, and while you can never really know from a simple gesture like that, it feels to me like he understands more than just what I said. And I go about my day.\n\nI don't think anyone in this situation did exactly the right thing, but I also think it's rarely possible to do exactly the right thing. All I know is that I got triggered, bigtime, but I walked out of that place with the same great no-drama masculine haircut I like, and I felt good again. Maybe even a little better than I had before, because I already knew there were transphobic assholes all over, but I didn't know that my barber isn't one of them. Now I do, and I can keep coming back to this shop even though I had a nasty experience there today. That feels like a small victory, even if it's not a pure and glorious one.\n\nI'm not feeling like I need support over this; I'm just sharing an experience others might be able to identify with, and would welcome any ideas about how others handle situations like this.", "date": "2018-03-18 16:55:14", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/85cfxw/had_an_experience_at_the_barber_shop_it_was_awful/", "author": "abyssinian"}, {"title": "I was subscribed to A LOT of problematic subreddits and I am ashamed of myself for even subscribing in the first place.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-03-18 19:00:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/85daxr/i_was_subscribed_to_a_lot_of_problematic/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": ".", "text": "", "date": "2018-03-18 19:51:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/85dnr8/_/", "author": "Dannyboiapples"}, {"title": "Feminists join men-only swim in protest of proposed law to enable people to self-identify as male or female", "text": "", "date": "2018-03-18 20:52:47", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/85e3kr/feminists_join_menonly_swim_in_protest_of/", "author": "-Be_like_water-"}, {"title": "Rambling about my therapist and how I feel about HRT", "text": "Hi all, I'm new here, my name is Sal, I'm AFAB and I'm 17 years old.\nI've known I'm nonbinary for probably around 2 and a half years, maybe a little more.

She kept asking me questions I couldn't answer like \"What don't you like about being a girl?\" \"What stereotypes do you associate with girls that makes you not want to be one?\"\n\nI rarely get dysphoria. Like maybe once every 6 months. When I do it's *super intense* but there's no reason behind it. Nothing makes me not want to be a girl. I would be fine being a girl. I'm just happier nonbinary.

I graduated from college with a degree in journalism, but haven't yet been able to get a full-time job in that field. Since my nickname doesn't sound like a real name, I tend to use my legal name on professional stuff, including all the articles I've gotten published from school, internships, and freelancing.\n\n-\n\n**The dilemma:** I'm AFAB and my legal first name is EXTREMELY feminine. I want to legally change my name to my nickname since my birth name has been making me more and more dysphoric, plus it's annoying not having any documentation to prove the name I actually go by. Problem is, I feel like I need to keep my original first name as part of my legal name, or else I'll have to either out myself every time I apply for a job, or not be able to use any of my old writing samples, which would make getting a real journalism job basically impossible. I could legally change to [Nickname as First Name] [Birth First Name as Middle Name] [Last Name] and say that I \"use my middle name in print because it sounds more professional,\" but that would still make my name very feminine overall and not do anything for the dysphoria.\n\n-\n\n**The brilliant solution I came up with yesterday:** Two middle names, one feminine and one masculine. I could legally change to [Nickname as First Name] [Birth First Name as Middle Name #1]-[Masculine Middle Name #2] [Last Name]. That way, I could still pull the \"I use one or both of my middle names in print because they sound more professional\" thing without having to throw away all my old career progress, while still having the satisfaction of an overall gender neutral name and the name that I actually go by in real life legally recognized as my first name.\n\n-\n\nI realize this is all very specific to my situation, but I figured I should post it anyway just in case it's helpful to anyone else out there who has stuff published under their birth name, or any other sort of ties that would make totally ditching the birth name difficult.

I don't shave, wear make up, or wear a bra. My clothing style is androgynous. I am this way because I find it to be low maintenance, comfortable, and I don't like the expectation of appearing \"feminine\".\n\nBeing a person who doesn't accept traditional femininity doesn't make me feel like I'm not a woman. The only reason I feel like a woman is because of my body, I've never attached any more meaning to it than that, because other things associated with being a woman are derived through culture and change throughout region and history (i.e. It's a societal creation). I am perfectly happy being referred to as \"she\", I'm happy with girl/woman/female, so on, because they have no bearing on who I am as a person. I can be the exact same person no matter what body I'm in or pronouns I/others use.\n\nIt seems to me like non binary people reject traditional gender roles and prefer to express themselves however they see fit, regardless of expectation. I'm confused as to how being that way makes you not a girl or a boy, or both. Is it about body dysphoria, not wanting to be male or female or wanting to be both at the same time, physically? For those of you who are completely comfortable in your body, why do you identify as non binary? If it's solely because you do not fit into traditional gender roles and prefer to do your own thing, why does a different pronoun or gendered word make a difference? If you are biologically female but identify as non binary, and prefer to go by they, why is that?  Why does \"she\" or \"woman\" make you uncomfortable? Is it the traditional associations with those terms? \n\nIf we can agree that gender is a societal creation, and that you can have a male or female body and dress and act however you'd like, why are pronouns or labels relevant?

I'm not even sure how to go about how to ask people I know to use my they/them pronouns. My name is not legally changed and I go by something other than my name on my insurance.

There are surgeons in my area that specialize in breast reduction and reshaping but I dont know how educated they are about non- binary trans-folk or even binary trans-folk they are. \n\nI have...no idea how to navigate this. Ive never been out to a provider before, and Ill need to get a yearly physical soon anyways. This will be a good thing to learn. Has anyone run into this before?

I live halfway across the country from my parents and am mostly financially independent, so I'm not in any danger if things go poorly or whatever. But nonetheless, I feel like I should come out to my parents about this before I get started. Y'know, in case they decide don't want me coming home later in the summer. And because they'll probably end up finding out from someone else.\n\nAaaaanyway... I think that, if I told my parents I'm not a dude but a woman that they'd fight me on the matter and argue that it's a phase yadda yadda yadda. Ultimately I'd have to keep my foot down on the HRT, and they'd likely be a bit shocked and perhaps upset over the matter. But at least it'd be comprehensible to them; they've been made aware of trans people thanks to the recent surge in visibility.\n\nThe problem here is I don't think I can honestly say I'm not a dude but a woman. 'Cause the thing is, I don't feel like a dude, but I also don't feel like a woman. I mean I think a lot of that has to do with my dude body and whatnot and having grown up with fairly rigid gender roles (and no concept of trans identities until attending a hard-left university). But the fact of the matter is the best I can commit to right now is not being a dude. Maybe that'll change in the future... But that's what's up right now.\n\nAnd so the thing is I'm pretty sure my parents have no knowledge of nonbinary folks. Like I dunno if they've even heard of the concept. If they have, they probably see it the same way that they see bi folks: being rebellious teen-type people seeking attention or going through a phase or whatever. They're just not gonna take me seriously, in all likelihood.\n\nI'm not saying my parents are bad people, by the way. They're just not woke or nothing. They've a pretty old-school understanding of the world... They didn't go to liberal arts schools. :p\n\nAnyway, point is...

There is nothing wrong with having androgyny as a core component of your NB identitity.\n\nBut there is something wrong with perpetuating the idea that \"more androgynous\" = \"more NB\" or \"passing as NB\", or that others seeing you as androgynous means your NB identity is correct and valid. \n\nThere are plenty of folks who have non-androgynous NB identities, and I believe the perpetuation of the ideas stated above are harmful to NB folks who don't identify as androgynous or seek to portray an androgynous aesthetic. \n\nIt leaves us wondering if our femme or masc appearance is actually NB, especially if it \"matches\" our AGAB, because we don't have an appearance that is \"different\" from our AGAB whether it is androgynous or the other extreme end of the femme-masc spectrum or something else.

And what if it wasn't a guaranteed cure? Would you take it if you could live with the condition and it wasn't fatal?\n\nThat feels like the rock and the hard place situation I find myself in with the idea of transition. Like, fuck, I can't make that sacrifice. Losing all the things in my life that matter to me would make me suicidal in a way that my dysphoria doesn't. Losing the support structures that literally keep me together feels like burning down my house because I found a spider in it. Maybe that'll someday change and my \"house\" will be plagued with nests of black widows but right now it's just a house spider and I take it outside and hope it doesn't come back in for a while. It's been lurking recently, but it's still just a harmless house spider. Frightening, but not deadly.\n\nBut then of course I'm used to dealing with stuff on my own. I've always been too proud to see a therapist, even though I know I have autistic traits, Pure OCD, mild to moderate depression, anxiety and a ton of baggage left over from being bullied at school, I scrape though by trying to see the best in things and being as functional as I can (and to my credit, I hold down a full time job and the cracks rarely show, which makes me think a therapist wouldn't even diagnose some of the things I've seen in myself as being clinically significant).\n\nMaybe this would be easier if I was binary trans but I'm not. I'd have a path that is a bit clearer but instead there's a list of what T does and some of the side-effects fill me with euphoria and some with terror. I did that gender swap app thing and looked like my father and that's not me either. There's still a feminine side to my emotional identity that I'm not willing to sacrifice. There's a name that's the name my mother gave me one half of and my spouse gave me the other half of and I'm not willing to throw away either part. There are pronouns that I'm so used to that I even misgender myself. There's a job that I would undoubtedly lose (or at least become mocked and derided at). There's a spouse whom I love with everything I've got who, when I broached the subject, said that he could accept calling me \"he\" but not \"they\", because he doesn't believe in non-binary genders and is pretty rigid about the things he's learned in life (He hates even learning a new button layout on a video game controller). I was hurt and tried to stay calm but ended up sounding like I was giving a lecture and even I thought I came off sounding like a douche when I tried to explain. We had to stop talking about it because I'm so raw and confused and can't seem to explain what it really means.\n\nI feel like I'm doing all of this so, so badly and I'm serving nobody, least of all myself. I feel like I'm not ready for any of this, but most of all I feel like the world's not ready for me. And I'm not sure I can proceed down any kind of route without support from my spouse. I'm not like other people. I can't sacrifice my marriage. The love of my life is the one point in my universe that gives me meaning, and I take great pride in the fact that I've been happily married for 12 years. To fuck that up for *this* seems absurd to me based on my own personal priorities in life (your mileage may vary and I'd never judge anyone who made different choices, you have to do what's right for you).\n\nI don't even know how to proceed at this point. I just calmly try to keep talking when I feel brave enough to broach the subject. I try to do little things for myself to make me feel more comfortable. I try to figure myself out best I can and define it so that it's easier to explain, but it's so HARD to put words to this nebulous concept that is gender and dysphoria and the \"wrongness\" I feel.\n\nI do know that it's not going to go away now that I've named it and acknowledged it properly. The dreams are going to continue. I know that the spider is mine to keep whether I want it here or not. I've thought about going to therapy, but that's a financial strain I'm not sure I can afford and I'm afraid I'll either not connect with the therapist or end up being pushed down a road I'll regret later. Or everything will come tumbling out and I'll completely collapse.\n\nI can't live a life of denying who I am or I'll resent it. That's why I came out as bisexual before I married. I understand that. But I'm not sure how to live a life where I accept myself but also make some sacrifices to keep my life the way it is. Maybe I want to have my cake and eat it and it's impossible. But I've always tried to be someone who asks for very little. I'd be okay if I could just mitigate my dysphoria a little bit, do something affirming... but I'm too scared to even like, buy a binder. I bought a sports bra and it didn't even fit like the size chart said because I have large shoulders, and that took so much emotional energy I just feel like I can't... so I wait and I wait, hoping something will change in my life or the world that makes this all easier and less destructive.\n\nI suppose I just want to be told that everything's going to be all right. Only I'm not sure I believe it any more. I'd settle for things being OK for a few more years at this point. I feel like I just got my shit together in life and I deserve to enjoy it... and then all this crap fell out of my closet and I resent that a little bit... does that make sense?\n\nHoping I'm not coming off as shitty or phobic anywhere in this post. Because I don't hate anyone. In fact I like to support trans people who need a boost on a bad day because yeah, I totally get how rough this shit is. And I admire the people who've had to burn their lives down to survive and walk out of the flames as amazing, strong, authentic people. I wish I could be strong enough, but I'm not strong enough. Unless it's 'transition or die' I'm not sure I'll ever be strong enough.\n\nI'm not sure what I need from this post just needed to let some of this stuff out. It's hurting and I need to voice it. So say what you can say, be as cutting as you need to be, but don't judge me if I'm not willing or able to take your (probably good) advice.\n\nThanks for reading.\n", "date": "2018-03-29 08:59:20", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/87zs5w/what_if/", "author": "Reis_Asher"}, {"title": "Not feeling valid", "text": "Edit: Thank you all so much for the affirming comments &lt;3 I appreciate you!!\n--\nRight now, I'm openly identifying as non-binary.

In the day, they are Edie - who is not aware of Gnome - and in the night, her body transforms into her brother Gnome\u2019s male body, and he takes over the control.

My boyfriend was super upset and asking if there was anything we could do to alleviate it. Of course I wanted HRT but that's not really realistic for us right now financially (or socially because of republican family members) so he was trying to figure out other ways to help. I ended up buying a new binder and some gay clothes (plaid jackets shirts with gay or trans slogans on them) which helped but a lot of my dysphoria comes from being in public. I hate the constant reminder that I'm a girl(ma'am/miss/her) and I told him it either feels like I have to be a girl or completely isolated to avoid being called that. So he suggested that if I didn't want to act like a girl in public I didnt have to. \n\nI initially did it because my anxiety is so so bad the only time I was super public I ended up vomiting even though nothing bad happened. Its just very very stressful and I live in a small city in a mostly rural are in Illinois (not Chicago lol tho I wish) so I have no idea what to expect so I just did girl mode a lot. So anyway anyway: being public. I'm terrified and I'm not sure how to do it? Im so scared of people making triggered jokes or saying slurs at me or since I'm nonbinary (agender they/them) I am even more scared of people assigning me gender based off my body parts because my gender is \"fake\" I know I don't have to correct every person like cashiers or strangers on the street.

I came close to do surgery and take hormones to have my body non-binary conforming, based on what is \"expected\" for people who are genderqueer. I had major body dysphoria at that point as genderfluid, being that my gender identity fluctuated through the gender spectrum. An LGBTQ+ psychologist pointed out that what is important is that you are okay with yourself and not pay too much attention to how others perceive you - if surgery helps, by all means, but think about what that entails. That helped me a lot and gave me a lot of strength and empowerment on my identity. I gave up the idea of changing myself to meet society's expectations, and it made me realise how messed up our society actually is.\n\nBut that is my experience. I realise that everyone has their journeys; everyone's lives are different, some more privileged than others. I often hear people say that they want to look a certain way and will go through lengths to reach it. As I write this I realise my post might be seen as something very ignorant, on the other hand, it might be seen as not. While I honestly believe that everyone should do whatever makes them feel happy, me being one of these people, I also wonder why is it not okay to simply be how we are? That it is okay to be a dude with a vagina or a woman with a penis. Is this not something society keeps telling us how we are supposed to be? That the representation of transmen and transwomen are often represented by a muscular man or very feminine woman? That non-binary people are people who obviously look like they haven't got a distinct gender? That kind of ideas messed me up big time for many years; and surely you might have experienced this too? Isn't our body dysphoria a product of society telling us how we are to be? Then the things we do to ourselves to become what society expects us to be? If we do not meet those standards, we are called snowflakes and marginalised.\n\nA few years back, in a Pride, there was a lecture by a gay cis-man saying he was against marriage equality. He was against it because approving marriage equality would only welcome a handful of people into the inner circle of society and elude a country to be \"LGBTQ-friendly\". The rest of the LGBTQ+ community would still be marginalised, and thereby forgotten because \"we finally got marriage equality\". While trans-men who look like \"men\" and trans-women who look like \"women\" is now more accepted, being non-binary or trans without conforming with trans-gender-stereotypes is not. The LGBTQ+ community is a *very* diverse group and it is honestly impossible to put LGBTQ+ people in boxes as there are so many different identities. I honestly love being part of this community, and proudly wave the rainbow flag. I am concerned though that our community, especially the younger generation, are feeling forced/expected to be a certain way. I do not know, however, if these concerns are as ignorant as assuming that feminist women cannot be stay-at-home-moms.\n\nThoughts on this?", "date": "2018-04-06 18:45:11", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8ac0wp/please_do_not_get_me_wrong/", "author": "twitchingJay"}, {"title": "Enby problems", "text": "", "date": "2018-04-06 20:34:36", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8acv3c/enby_problems/", "author": "HexTheRobot"}, {"title": "My favorite selfie, growing my hair out!

[30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir.]\n\nThis is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out.\n\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\n\nI grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. \n\nI was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.\n\nBy high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.\n\nWhen I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I \"put a ring on it\" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my \"first.\" It was the right thing to do.\n\nDuring the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two \"out\" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a \"don't ask don't tell\" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. \n\nAfter around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the \"right thing.\"]\n\nThus began my \"wild oats\" phase. I hooked up with my \"Rachael,\" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.\n\n\n[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]\n\n\nWhich brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. \n\nIt was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.\n\nSue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).\n\nWe were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. \n\n\n[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]\n\n\nThree years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt \"right\" it just felt \"good.\" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.\n\nA couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black \"corset\" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.\n\nShe freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.\n\nThe next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.\n\nAfter a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. \"I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point.\" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think \"crossdresser\" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way \"queer,\" or just beyond the \"norm.\" I knew it meant something to me.\n\nBut I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.\n\nI look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was \"rough\" but we were making it through. \n\nAnd maybe we were?\n\nOne night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1\" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.\n\nI wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would \"act different.\" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was \"a dude in a dress,\" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the \"dude in a dress\" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.\n\n\n[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]\n\n\nI feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a \"purge.\" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.\n\nSue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.\n\nBut it did get normalized. \n\nI broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.\n\nBut I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would \"come out\" because I didn't know what I would \"come out\" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.\n\nWe bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our \"options.\" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself \"wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father.\" And I started crying.\n\nWe had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about \"alternative families during their first pregnancy\" and brought it up to Sue. \"Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that.\" \n\nAfter the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was \"trans-trans.\" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a \"woman trapped in a mans body.\" I didn't feel like there was this \"old me\" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.\n\nLate last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.\n\nI realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the \"girly\" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.\n\nThat month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my \"timeline or endpoint.\" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. \n\nAnd the more I explored \"NBness\" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.\n\nThe floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. \n\nI started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.\n\n\n[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]\n\n\nChristmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.\n\nI don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. \n\nIt wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being \"bitchy\" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.\n\nBut the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.\n\nHer father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: \n\nHe said, \"if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave.\" \n\nI understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.\n\nSue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.\n\nA month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: \n\n1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing\n\n2) She wishes I was \"normal\" again\n\n3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.\n\nNot satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I \"dont care about [my daughter].\"\n\nThat hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me \"youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it.\" I walked past her repeating \"leave me alone leave me alone\" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.\n\nThe woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sue knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said \"here's johnny.\" \n\nI deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.\n\nIt was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.\n\nI was alone. \n\nAnd I've been alone ever since.\n\nI have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.\n\nI've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.\n\nI was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.\n\nI'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.\n\nI have a really great friend from work that started after I was \"out\" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.\n\nI didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough \"notice.\" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.\n\nI had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. \n\nI am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.\n\nI havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.\n\nI thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.\n\nI doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.\n\n\nTL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.\n\n\nEDIT: formatting and spelling\n\n\nEDIT 2: As if you need more to read, here is the contents of my \"coming out post\" I made the day after she left.\n\n\nDear World,\nMy name is [birth name]. I am not a freak. I am not a monster. I am a person. With hopes and dreams and fears and ambitions. I am also non-binary. What does that mean? It means I don\u2019t let the shape of genitalia determine how I interact with the world. It means I don\u2019t shove myself into a man shaped box or a woman shaped box. The shape of my body does not define my role in the world and does not preclude me from finding joy where I see it. In practice, I\u2019ve been experimenting with makeup and a more feminine expression in my clothing choices. I choose the middle path. It shouldn\u2019t hurt you to hear this, and if it does you should ask yourself why. This has been a journey I found myself on over 5 years ago and it has not been an easy road. At times it has been very lonely and painful, but I find that most of that pain and anguish came from holding a part of myself back from the world. I come to praise [birthname], not to bury him. The label only serves to describe my feelings, but it does not define me. Only I define me. And I am [birthname]. The passionate, sympathetic, caring, and loving person I hope you\u2019ve always known me to be. I will not be held hostage by society. I will not be made to think I am \u201cless than.\u201d I am the new normal: a world existing in and on a vast spectrum that \u201cblack\u201d and \u201cwhite\u201d couldn\u2019t begin to describe. Join me or not, but I hope you will. \u270c\ufe0fone love\n\n", "date": "2018-04-08 02:32:31", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8an4qz/i_thought_i_was_one_of_the_lucky_ones/", "author": "beautyinthebeast"}, {"title": "In need of help finding community", "text": "I've recently been exploring my gender, and I've settled on calling myself nonbinary.

For a while I thought I might be trans but that never felt right, and I eventually just ignored and thought \"Oh I'm a guy--end of story.\"  \nRecently, I've gone back to questioning. I feel as thought I'm male but I do suffer with a bit of dysphoria and definitely felt a lot of euphoria in my life.  \nI feel as thought I'd be more comfortable in a feminine body such as filled out hips, curves etc. Yet, I don't know if I want breasts or enlarged female nipples, in fact it's a bit of a huge con for me (even though many who kinda identify the same way I do have told me they got used to the breasts and ended up liking them) and I'm also afraid that my face will become \"so feminine\" that I'd feel dysphoric bout that as well and look like an \"odd looking guy\". I still want to be a guy but verrrry feminine as I relate heavily to that side and want to be able to do it in a way that does make me look like a man in a dress either.  \n\n\nAnother thing that's been confusing me is the difference between aging as a male and aging as a male on female hormones. Will I continue to get more masculine as I grow older if I decide to not go on hormones? Some other physical differences, etc.  \n\nAs you can tell I'm a bit (okay, a lot) confused. I want to be able to pass and wear girl clothes/girly clothes, but when I see female faces/mtfs I feel like that isn't what would make me happy. I guess there is a large lack of AMAB non-binary representation so it makes it a bit harder.  \n\nAlso I'm 24/m/and a larger individual as well. I have \"moobs\" if you will. I'm also in a situation where I can't really express myself the way I'd want (religious family etc). I'll be seeing a therapist soon to talk through this and figure out some stuff hopefully.

They're trying to be inclusive but they're doing it in ways that are the complete opposite!\n\n\n\nAs part of championing diversity, my workplace has begun a so-called Gender Intelligence Initiative.  Frankly, it's horrifying.  The entire premise is a gender-essentialist exercise in biological determinism - think \"men are from Mars, women from Venus\" levels of bad parading as so-called equality.  It revolves around the idea that men and women are in some ways fundamentally different and uses stereotypes as examples.  They literally included the well-debunked \"female brain at rest\" vs \"male brain at rest\" CT scans in the presentation.  The talks and information presented was so bad that it literally led to people saying things like \"so that's why my husband never listens!  Hahaha men!\" and \"see I told you women never make any sense!\".  \n\n\n\nThey presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don't even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!  If you get tested for spacial awareness, visual tendencies and all the other things we bell-curve by gender you may trend in a certain direction in some of them but chances are if you average out all of them you may well end up more vaguely defined in the middle damnit!

So I ignored it.  But now it seems like this is something that people in my office are trying to take forward and to start building ideas around.  \n \n\n\nI don't know how to explain that their attempt to be Gender Intelligent and inclusive is actually making me feel excluded and unsafe without outing myself.

But a part of me feels it's much more likely I'm non-binary or agender. Online in certain parts I've actually been identifying as trans-masculine and it's been working for now but I still don't know if it's really that accurate. \n\nAlso, I know that labels don't really matter but I am obsessed and won't be able to settle down until I get an actual idea of what I can call myself, even if it's just in private.\n\nWell... Here are the facts -\n\n* I don't like she/her pronouns. I don't mind they/them pronouns. He/him pronouns are weird but I think I like these most.\n\n* I have friends both male and female (no NB friends that I know of) and I feel a connection to all of them, but when I'm looking at strangers trying to see if I connect more with the guys or with the girl, it's typically neither. Sometimes it's a little more towards the guys but that depends.\n\n* If I HAD to be seen as one or the other, I'd rather be a guy but I would rather just be neither.\n\n* I honestly, truly wish I lived in a genderless world. \n\n* Some days I feel like I'm definitely non-binary and I'm just fooling myself by sticking to the binary because it would be easier and I have some internalized shit to sort out when I think of non-binary identities.\n\n* I kind of want to identify as agender and say I \"don't have a *specific* gender\" but I know that doesn't really fit the definition all that well.\n\n* When it comes to bathrooms, I very, very heavily prefer gender neutral bathrooms and feel most comfortable there, though I don't hate the women's bathroom and I haven't tried the men's bathroom due to anxiety.\n\n* In a way, I feel like partially every gender and partially none at all, though clearly more male than female. I feel very \"other\" most of the time.\n\n* I get some dysphoria, mostly about my chest, sometimes about my genitals (honestly, my preferred genitals would be the bottom growth on T and nothing else), my name, and mildly about pronouns/being called a girl.\n\n* Sometimes I don't hate my feminine body, but I almost wish it were a costume I could take off most of the time. Which I know is not an option, but it's how I feel.\n\nWell, I think that just about covers it.

I'm AMAB, polysexual (essentially pan, but excluding cis men and possibly cis women), parent, legal alien in a country that's not my birth country, and I consider myself among the first round of millennials. Many years ago, still in the early stages of my \"awakening\", I became more aware of my non-straightness when my then-girlfriend came out to me, telling me she was not born in a woman's body, and my immediate reaction was \"and?\" and i realized that I'm attracted to her as a person, not a person of a specific gender.\n\nIt was around that time that I stumbled upon a kilt store in Seattle. My curiosity drove me in, their sales team was great, and in the end, I left money there, and was so thrilled that i left even more money the next day. My favorite was a version in heather gray, with pleats and four hidden pockets; their most feminine kilt version. Here's a picture of one: http://farm1.staticflickr.com/196/508273770_b1c84ad4c8_o.jpg.\n\nAnd so began the discovery of my own non-binaryness.\n\nThe modern kilt gave me something important: an excuse to wear a skirt in public, including to work. People put it off as a fad, some thought i was a fashion victim. I even got one that matched my suit, so i wouldn't have to wear pants at work functions anymore. A manager at work once told me i should dress more professionally, and i asked him if he said that because of my gender, or because unbiforcated garments are inappropriate (he dropped the matter only after i asked him if we should go to HR together and find out whether they think there's a problem... he didn't want to). In stores, if a kid exclaimed loudly \"this man is wearing a skirt!\" then after the kid's parent corrected (or shushed) them, i could calmly say to the parents: \"your kid is right, though. Technically, a kilt is a kind of skirt.\" and fortunately most of them took it with humor or said they liked it or asked where i bought it :)\n\nEventually, i became more aware that my taste in clothing was not limited to things that are marketed to men. Yet, my anxiety prevented me from deviating more overtly in my presentation. Also, style options were limited: I'm just not that much a fan of floral patterns or glitter, and I didn't want to wear clothing just because it was marketed to women. It also needed to fit me, I needed to like the way it looked on me, and it needed to be comfortable. I also have a few hoodies and t-shirts I like that are purple and/or have some prints that i think are more likely to be worn by women, but nobody ever mentioned anything. Worst that happens is that (usually older) people burst out in laughter in public when they spot the small unicorn on one of my sweaters, and when i turn around to look at them, they apologize and sometimes i can even make very brief small-talk before they skedaddle.\n\nThen i discovered overalls. Sure, they're marketed to men in workwear stores; but it's mostly women wearing them casually (albeit often with extremely short legs or otherwise impractical). But still, bingo: another piece of clothing that i had an excuse to wear. If anything, i may have appeared a bit \"odd\" to others. And heck, they're comfortable! Came summer, though, they got a bit too warm, and i got a bit more daring and decided to hem the legs off one of my denim overalls at knee height. I got a few comments on it, mostly positive, including the most awesome comment of all: After a friend's mum asked me where they sell shortalls for men and i told her i couldn't find any so i had to alter one myself, she said they look \"cute\" on me. Nobody's ever called me that before, and it felt so good! I just never told anyone before how good that comment felt to me at the time...\n\nThat said, to go with my legwear, I sport red Dr. Martens, and I think one of my next pairs will be Docs that i so far always wanted to buy but never dared to, because they're listed under \"Womens\".\n\nI can tell that I am slowly beginning to stop caring what other people think, and to assert myself (thanks again to my therapist for helping me work through those anxieties). If someone says to me that it's odd for a man to wear XYZ, I simply ask them: \"why's that?\" and then watch them realize their own bias. Or if someone says \"they're woman's pants, because the zipper fly opens on the wrong side\" i reply \"really? why... what does the side of the fly have to do with gender?\". All of those conversations have gone well so far, even in other western countries I've visited. The worst comment i got was at a train station in Germany when an older person commented: \"You're quite a colorful bird, aren't you?\" but it was a rhetorical question and i'm not quite sure what to make of it.\n\nBut despite my \"progress\", I find myself looking for more options that I can use to push the boundaries of my presentation without risking too much.\n\nSo far I have: Kilts, Overalls, Shortalls, colorful shoes. Does anyone have other suggestions for what I could add, that fall into this low-risk boundary-pushing category?\n\nTL;DR: Some people think that gender-neutral clothing for AFAB people would mean a hoodie and saggy pants, my search for the needle in a haystack is something like that but in reverse. Something that's more feminine, but on the careful side of things. Something that would offer me an \"excuse\" if i really needed one to defend against assholes.

I hoped I could rant and get some coping  strategies here. I felt so invalidated, so reduced and dirty, maybe someone can understand my feelings.\n \nSo I was grocery shopping with my boyfriend and he wanted to buy me Mon Cheri pralines, which contain a little bit of alcohol. We are small, but at least he looks certainly older than 16, which is the age law for alcohol here in Germany (except for hard alcohol, which you can only buy at 18. I'm 23, btw). We were in line and once the cashier had the pralines in his hand he asked us for a validation of our age. I sighed, because I had a hard day and it was just so pointless. My boyfriend said yes and startet looking for his passport, but he looked at my chest and said he wanted to see *my* passport. I was so angry at that moment, which was apparent, he took the pralines away and said something along the lines of \"well then I'll keep them here\". I felt sick to my stomach. I wasn't even the one buying them, my boyfriend was. I looked forward to eating them, because that was supposed to be the highlight of a shitty day. I know I should've just walked away, but I became aggressive, showed him my passport and mumbled some swear words which he didn't hear. I felt so reduced when he looked at my chest and decided to use his power over me. Since I don't identify as female and my small looking breasts were the cause of this I had an episode of crying and feeling like shit in my body, even though I was looking pretty androgynous today, aside from my breasts.

With the mods permission, I've linked a google form that has a few loosely guiding questions asking about how you identify and how your hair had/has played a role in either shaping your identity or not, and how it plays into your overall presentation and navigation in society. The responses are completely anonymous and you can include as much or as little information as you want. I'd really appreciate if anyone has time to share their stories (anonymously) with me to help add a wider range of voices and experiences to this project than I'd be able to contribute alone. The responses would be used as quotes/paraphrases of varied experiences between people with different gender identities and how their hair has effected them, if it has had an impact at all. No identifying information will be collected and the responses will remain entirely anonymous, unless you choose to specifically disclose your age and gender identity in your response/give me express permission to use those two pieces of information when referencing your response in my project. You can also respond in the comments below if thats easier than filling out the form, just be sure to write somewhere how I can use your story when referencing it in my work - can I pull direct quotes, would you rather it be paraphrased, do you want your age/gender identity to be included, etc. Thanks so much in advance for anyone who has the time to contribute!  https://goo.gl/forms/2fqsFBnrIhbr93yz1\n\nsidenote: I'm pretty new to reddit so if I haven't posted right please let me know how to fix it.", "date": "2018-04-16 15:48:43", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8coijw/hair_and_gender_identity_project/", "author": "space_trashFTM"}, {"title": "My friends got married on Saturday.

I know I'm not at all a woman even if it took steps to pull away from that. First I id'd as bigender(woman and demiboy/boy) then androgyne(still a mix of boy and girl), neutrois, and finally agender(though I\u2019m trying to figure out if agenderflux/agender+male or whatever the mess is more appropriate). \n\n3. The problem now is I can't tell if I still don't want to let go of what's familiar to me and say I'm completely binary trans man and I'm inventing my dysphoria about not wanting phallo because the penis would be too large(although I still don't want it for various other reasons) and inventing it about other things. \n\n4. The problem is that I also have dysphoria about basically everything with this body pre-t. I absolutely know for sure I want t, top surgery, meta w/possible scrotoplasty and the works, but I have such a bad opinion of he/him pronouns, being seen as a man(though I would take them in public to be comfortable because I know I want facial hair etc, it would hurt me if someone who knew I really wasn't a man to use he/him) etc. \n\n5. I know I love women and I've known since I was 12/13, been using the bi label since I was around 14(originally came out as a lesbian). The problem is that if I'm a dude, I know I'm not attracted to men/people who are leaning toward that and that I'm exclusively attracted to women and other non-men, which, in my mind only, means that I can't be bi and would be a straight man, which I just can't take, personally. I also don\u2019t want my attraction to women to have to change, or know that, as a person seen as a man, I would feel like I can\u2019t enjoy the wlw ships I have for a very long time and found an immense amount of identity in(Marceline/Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time, basically all of my ships from Degrassi, ships from The 100, etc, etc) Along with this, I'm scared of cis straight women thinking I'm a man and being into me/wanting me to perform in a way a cis guy interested in women would, and similarly scared of not attracting bi women who are interested in nonbinary people as a nonbinary person.\n\n6. This is just an internalized racism thing and I'm fully aware but I don't want to be a black man. I don't have anything in common with the universal black man experience, mostly because, while it's stereotypical and I know all black men aren't like this, I'm not interested in collecting Jordan's and doing all of that other stuff. Which I know doesn't make anyone a man but in my mind it does, and I don't do those things. I feel like if I was white I wouldn't worry about this part nearly as much for obvious reasons, but I don't want to walk around this world being seen as a black man(which, again I really want facial hair so I would deal with it but it would be severely uncomfortable especially for dating). \n\nMy real thing is that I just want to be me, but with all the 'nonbinary people aren't real/nonbinary people are cis' stuff it's super invalidating and I've literally spent every day for the past month or so probably thinking 'am I really just a trans guy/the best I could qualify is nonbinary trans guy I could never call myself a man/ I like being called a gentleman/handsome etc and I like taking a masculine role in relationships blah blah blah but I can\u2019t just take the final leap'. I just feel like I want to be a man in everything but name/brain wise, if that makes any sense, like I want to \u2018look like a man\u2019 but can\u2019t handle people treating me like one.  \n\nI just want to be able to let this go and focus on being on t etc but it\u2019s gonna be a whole nother year before I can move and start since I\u2019m in college rn with no options. So until then I\u2019ll have to waffle back and forth. \nEdit: Wow okay this is even longer than I thought in reddit format, reformatted.\n\nTL;DR: I want to be a man in everything but name but I'm afraid that that's just me being afraid of being a straight black man, that I won't be myself anymore and won't be attractive/will be attractive to people assuming I'm cis/a binary man. \n", "date": "2018-04-22 21:02:14", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8e66rh/i_know_im_trans_but_i_keep_doubting_whether_or/", "author": "sweatshirtpants"}, {"title": "New Haircut - I told the stylist to make me look like a super hero", "text": "", "date": "2018-04-22 21:09:11", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8e68fa/new_haircut_i_told_the_stylist_to_make_me_look/", "author": "RuthCarter"}, {"title": "Tl;Dr: I want Baphomet's body and I feel like nobody gets it.", "text": "I started T October 2017 and wanted to stop exactly one year on it, as I'd had the changes that I personally needed from hormones. My face and body were perfectly androgynous and I hardly had any facial hair to speak of.\n\nI remembered thinking that facial hair would be this super validating thing for me to have before starting T. I never actually had much chest dysphoria but felt this pressure to bind even though I never really minded my chest. Presently, I quite like it and if I'm being perfectly frank, it sometimes gives me gender euphoria when I'm having a good boob day.\n\nI tried briefly to stop hormones and to express my gender in a more traditionally feminine way, only to feel ostracized by the trans students on my campus and later much of the under 25 LGBT community online. Funny how the internet loves \"softbois,\" or femme trans men, yet finds ways to make genderfluidity problematic.\n\nThose who expressed disapproval were accusing me of enjoying feminine expression as just a sexual kink, which is funny considering that when I'm expressing my masculinity, I wear the tightest skinny jeans I can fit myself into while packing and wear low v neck t shirts to show off my chest hair. I'm a highly sexual person regardless and I express it when I'm feeling it.\n\nFast forward to now, my body hair has become so thick that it almost isn't human in comparison to cis men. It's so thick that if I leave it alone, it gets caught in my clothes and gets ripped out. If I shave it, it's even worse because the stubble is coarse enough to scrape others if they accidentally run their hands over it.\n\nAt this point I'm pursuing laser hair removal just to thin the hair out, not even remove it. Yet because of this, the fact that I've stopped testosterone and have no intention of having top surgery, any trans person I've talked to about this who's my age (24) or younger thinks I'm detransitioning.\n\nBut the reality is that my medical transition has only begun.\n\nIf I had to succinctly explain my gender identity to someone, I would use Baphomet as an example. I'm a total gym rat and I love the muscle mass that T has afforded me but I also love my breasts and sometimes question whether having them bigger would increase my gender euphoria. I miss my curves; I used to have some nice hips and a round butt but T has made them vanish. I'm planning to have metoidioplasty upon exiting the adult industry, where I present as a binary woman. (Not because I need to, I want to make that quite clear.)\n\nI'm open to going on T again in the future. But my main source of frustration at this point is feeling so misunderstood by the community. Others have regarded me as confused or have made harsh remarks about people who detransition, which isn't fair to people who do choose that.\n\nAny time I've tried to talk to someone under 25 about this, I'm always hit with this social justice lecture about how gender is just a social construct and how it's problematic to label primary or secondary sexual characteristics, clothing, makeup, hair, body language, whatever, as masculine or feminine. Give me a break. If those things really were meaningless, then nobody would transition. \n\nIt feels so dismissive when I'm just trying to express myself in the way that works best for me, which should be the ultimate goal of anyone's transition.", "date": "2018-04-22 21:25:21", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8e6c59/tldr_i_want_baphomets_body_and_i_feel_like_nobody/", "author": "Saturn-Ascending"}, {"title": "How to feel validated?", "text": "I'm an AFAB Nonbinary femboy and I really don't know what I can do to feel validated as my gender.

I used to identify as male and am typically read as such. About a 1-1/2 years ago, I ran into a dear friend who used the word \"non-binary\" when telling me about the team at her workplace. She said \"non-binary\" in such a casual context, like any other word, that there was not a good opportunity for me to ask what it meant. But I googled the heck out of it later. \n\nI was more focused on figuring out what \"non-binary\" meant, that i missed the invitation to explore what \"feeling not bound to the gender binary\" could mean to me. Fortunately, several months later, I encountered the gender unicorn, and with no pre-defined sliders, I wanted to fill it out and see where i could see myself on the spectrum. It helped me break out of the binary thinking pattern, allowing me to see myself more wholly, and it felt very liberating. I realized I have never shied away from doing things that some consider girl/women interests\", and don't like to conform to others' expectations, including presentation, and i openly refuse to participate in some \"male\" associated behaviors and activities. So i realized that nothing really had to change, even though i found an explanation, a new perspective, and a motivation to go be myself more, and be more comfortable being myself.\n\nYesterday during a work meeting with my immediate team, a diversity subject came up with a subtle hint to non-binary gender identities, followed by a gender distribution example that mentioned \"20% males\". My team responded \"80% women? How's that equal?\" and without taking a pause to think clearly, i said \"That's not how this works.\" My entire team looked at me, waiting for an explanation, so I continued: \"I mean, it's 2018, is the gender binary really still so important?\". It seemed like my team thought i made a joke, maybe one that they didn't get. Their reaction wasn't threatening or disrespectful, more like baffled or confused. Only one coworker looked at me funny, as if he had already suspected. I saw that my entire team would continue to be blind to the gender non-binary if i didn't take another stab at getting an explanation across. And i thought the best way was to reveal to them that they know someone who is nobinary, and it's OK. I explained: \"I felt it important to mention, because i'm part of the 80% in the example that was brought up. I'm non-binary. It's nothing new, there's just usually no need to tell people about it.\"\n\nI gave no further explanation, and nobody asked a question (not that i expected any). They all continued to treat me the same way as far as I can tell, probably  because we all get along well and they already noticed that i'm not conforming to cis gender norms, even if they didn't have a good label for that. \n\nAt the end of the day today, one of my colleagues came to me and confessed: \"You know, after you told me what you told me yesterday, i went to my spouse and asked her if she knew what nonbinary meant, because i didn't. Usually, she knows such things, but she didn't know either. So i googled it. An hour later, she asked me if I had figured it out and i had to tell her that I've been reading stuff on the internet about it for an hour, that i have a bit of an idea of what it might mean, but i'm still not entirely sure.\" - I told him that this is what it feels like to me sometimes, too, and he replied \"I believe it.\" ;-)\n\nTLDR: when my team misunderstood a diversity-related subject that hinted at non-binary gender identification, i tried to clarify but the team misunderstood again. I felt an obligation to end non-binary invisibility for them, and found the best way was to reveal myself as non-binary, without big explanation, figuring they'd either ask or google it.

Being extremely tall (6ft+), fond of men\u2019s clothing, short-haired, and athletically built, I frequently pass for a somewhat androgynous male unless my name is brought up.

Under the paternal allele section (which I exhibit most of the traits of), they were listed as having a higher proportion of transmen than the control population.

I was about to go hang out with my friends (all boys at the time) in the summer and run around in the sprinklers and I wanted to take my shirt off and run around in my shorts like all the boys. My babysitter at the time told me I had to wear a shirt, even though it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and I remember being crushed. I think it was the first time I realized that being assigned as a girl meant that my life would go in a different path from my friends. \n\nThe next time I remember really rankling against my gender was in high school. I knew I was bi or gay, although I wasn't sure which (still am not), but I was co-president of my school's GSA and doing research online at the time and stumbling across the idea of genderqueer. I immediately latched onto it and did a test drive of coming out while I was at debate camp over the summer between freshman and sophomore year (summer of 2005). It went poorly because teenagers are cruel, so I buried those feelings until college. I went by my assigned name (feminine), my middle name (ambiguous gender) and Vincent on and off over the years depending on the group I was interacting with. I eventually landed on just going by my feminine name because it was easier.\n\nFor the next several years I kind of put it aside because gender identity took a major back seat to the fact that I had some other mental health and trauma that needed to be processed before I could deal with those questions. But then I got help, and my brain had the capacity to start thinking about gender again.\n\nNow when I'm in spaces and I have to identify my pronouns and I use she/her/hers sometimes I feel neutral about it, and other times I feel physically wrong as the words come out of my mouth. I was listening to a friend who is trans the other night about new pronouns, and she mentioned ve/ver/vis and those felt immediately right to me in a way I can't articulate. I feel like I need to start reexamining my gender for my own mental health, and nonbinary with non they/them/theirs pronouns just feels right.\n\nI am very overweight and my body has extremely predominant, even overdeveloped feminine characteristics. I want to start exploring different gender expressions but feel very constrained by my body. And yes, I have tried losing weight but I just don't have a good metabolism and losing a lot of weight would come at the expense of my health. \n\nI mostly just wanted to get this out there in the world and maybe feel less alone? I would also love tips on how AFAB folks with large breasts and hips have started to explore different gender expressions and the experiences people have had with nontraditional pronouns in English.

It makes me feel invalid every time I see or hear a comment like that and it honestly is becoming a problem because I want to be myself, but people just stop me from doing that and it leaves me feeling alone and angry and sometimes even depressed.

Despite coming to a realization about my identity and orientation, I love my partner (AFAB) and we seem compatible sexually. But in the last year or so, I've had increased issues with decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. I still feel strong attraction to my partner, and I get excited during foreplay, but penetration now stresses me out. Each instance of low performance increases my anxiety.\n\nI'm comfortable with oral sex or pleasuring my partner with a toy or my fingers, but they say it's just not the same. They are more satisfied by penetration.\n\nI experience dysphoria with my penis on occasion. It's more of a tool to me than a part of my body. If I transitioned I'm not sure I'd miss it, but it's familiar and I know how it works. Or I thought I did.\n\nI think I have a lot of internalized toxic masculinity from my decades trying to pass as cis male. I'm seeing a therapist, and trying to work through these issues.\n\nMy partner is very supportive and never makes me feel impotent or ashamed, but I know it hurts them. We used to have incredible sex, and I love them entirely, so this has been incredibly frustrating for both of us.\n\nI recently had some testosterone injections, which I've been iffy about in the past because I thought they'd stifle my femme side. Turns out I had low hormones across the board. The shots helped me feel more energetic and my sex drive increased, but I'm still having anxiety over the actual penetration, and finding myself getting soft minutes after getting aroused in foreplay.\n\nWe've experimented with pegging (them topping me, which I enjoyed but didn't climax) and as I mentioned, I really enjoy performing cunnilingus and fingering, to the point that I get a dopamine release similar to orgasm (I call em drygasms), but I have a hard time climaxing if my partner isn't fully enjoying themselves. I can't use a partner in a selfish way. I'm too aware of how hurtful that is. \n\n I honestly sometimes hate depending on my penis so much. It feels transphobic and shitty to not feel like we're having sex if there's no vaginal insertion. If it would just do what I want, then my partner and I could get past this.\n\nOur marriage is great. We've been together 6 years. We communicate, we are emotionally intimate and honest, we enjoy each others company.\n\nSo what gives? I'm willing to try pretty much anything at this point. I just got prescribed some ED drug treatment that my doctors believe will help me get my sexual confidence back, so we'll see how that goes, I guess.\n\nI'm worried my condition could be something that won't get better. \n\nMy partner is a schoolteacher and their job has become a source of constant stress for both of us.\n\nI'm transitioning careers and have been going to school (hard at my age, but I inherited a windfall from my Dad so we had the financial security to go single income).\n\nSo maybe it's just stress. I have an anxiety disorder, my partner has clinical depression. Needless to say, as a leftist, feminist, NB couple this current presidential administration is a source of much fear and stress, so none of that is helping.\n\nThe thing that sucks the most is how this affects my partner's self esteem and their own dysphoria. And I constantly worry that we somehow are going to become less and less compatible even though we deeply care for each other.\n\nFinal note: I go soft when masturbating too, but can usually get it back. I think this is because I'm alone and don't get embarrassed or anxious. I almost never watch porn since I came out. (haven't found a lot that caters to my orientation or preferences that isn't horribly transphobic or sexist). Watched a lot in my teens and early 20s, but cut way back once in a committed relationship.\n\nWhat a mess.\n", "date": "2018-05-05 23:30:46", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8hbapc/dysphoria_is_affecting_my_sex_life_possibly/", "author": "Evil_Unicorn728"}, {"title": "Vegan &amp; Enby?", "text": "My SO just pointed out that all the NBs he knows (3) are vegan.

I\u2019ve been realizing for awhile that I want to dress more androgynously because I don\u2019t like that everyone who meets me instantly puts me right into the cishet guy box, since I\u2019m nonbinary and I consider myself a somewhat feminine gay guy. I don\u2019t know where to start. \n\nHere\u2019s my problem- I\u2019m disabled. I have quadriparesis (incomplete loss of function in all 4 limbs), so I have little leg, trunk, and hand strength. Now, I mostly wear loose-ish jeans or shorts and t shirts. I also wear sneakers exclusively because I wear clunky leg braces that require roomy shoes. It\u2019s not impossible for me to wear anything else, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wearing for years. When I first became a quad it was all I could wear but I\u2019ve been learning how to do buttons and stuff. I just haven\u2019t bothered.

I know t shirts already do, but I sort of want to elevate my appearance more and want to wear more button shirts and polos. What colors and fits? What about pants? I want to look more elevated and put-together, because as a visibly disabled person with a fairly severe impairment I feel like I\u2019m underestimated. Belts are a big no-no because they put pressure on my skin wrong (I use a wheelchair) and my impairment means I don\u2019t always feel skin damage. I\u2019m also a Floridian and I can\u2019t control my body temperature well due to my impairment so layers (more than 2 thin layers) and jackets are out too. I can do buttons when given enough time and the right tools, so button shirts are fine.

There was something about it that made me feel free, as though I were breaking not only biological boundaries, but also binary ones.\n\nIdentifying as female, while it is certainly a wonderful feeling, almost feels ever-so-slightly wrong, in some way, despite my 100% female expression and usage of she/her pronouns, feminine name, yada yada yada... I just feel as though there's a tiny bit of me that misses that feeling coming from identifying as NB. Yet, at the same time, I'm fine with identifying as female.\n\nLet's put it this way: I am perfectly okay with identifying as female with all my main friends and my family. I prefer she/her pronouns over anything else, I love my feminine name, and I present 100% feminine. At the same time, I love that odd sense of freedom gained from identifying as NB, and would like to express an NB identity to, at the very least, online LGBTQ+ friends.\n\nI'm worried that this might not really be a yearn to identify as NB, though, and that it might be a sort of \"transtrender\" scenario. That I'm really just yearning for identifying as NB to feel \"cool\" and \"different,\" especially because I talk to NB people and admire them. This worry is accentuated by the fact that I don't outwardly seem to be NB at all, because of my apparent gear toward female identity. I just wanted to know if it would be harmful in any way to identify as NB given the circumstances, if it really could just be a transtrender-like thing. And, if I were to ID as NB, what gender would I even apply as? Given that I'm so inherently female-seeming, is there really any point?\n\nTL;DR I like the feeling of IDing as NB, but I'm worried it might be a \"transtrender\" sort of thing due to how feminine I present + usage of she/her pronouns + not really minding female identity.

For the past while I've personally done a lot in trying to live better and be better and understand myself and be compassionate. The whole schabang really. Through this, I've really come to understand how restrictive and reductive labels are, just by their very nature. That's just a personal belief of mine based on my own experience, and I was able to prove that to myself by taking off labels as they come up and really benefiting from it. I used to call myself Muslim, but I don't anymore. I still pray and fast and read the Quran, but I don't say I'm Muslim because I don't believe there's one definable cut and dry term for \"Muslim,\" it's too abstract of a concept. And that goes for any religion or any other label. I also meditate and read sutras and take refuge in the Buddha the Sangha and the Dharma, but i also don't say I'm Buddhist for the same reason. Also, I believe living things are always in a state of constant change and that we are a sum of flowing aggregates, and labels do not change, they're unmoving.\n\nAnyways, this is all my roundabout way of saying that I don't really want to define myself by gender. But that's a little tricky for me at the moment. Biologically I'm a male and I'm attracted to women. I've never really felt genderqueer in any way. Also, though sexuality is distinct from gender, I've never been attracted to people of the same-sex. These are all things, however, that I've labeled with man-made terms that I don't necessarily consider to be right or wrong. I'm male and I guess in a lot of ways I act like a traditional \"guy,\" but at the same time however, I feel restricted by the label of \"male.\" I don't want to be called \"male\" because it's a label and therefore very reductive of who I am. But that same idea goes for every other gender label too. I don't want to call myself pangender because that would be restrictive in the same way. Or female, or agender, or any other spot on the spectrum. So what am I then? Is that a thing? It's confusing as hell.\n\ntl;dr: I'm not muslim, I'm not buddhist, but I'm not atheist. I just am. \nIn the same way, I'm not not male, I'm not genderqueer, but I'm not agender. I just am. Is that a thing? Can anyone relate to that? Would love to discuss it with you guys!\n\nAlso, I love all of you guys and when I talk about my beliefs in no way do I mean to impose on your beliefs. Do what you gotta do and I hope what you're doing gets you contentment.

I get a *lot* of \"gender feels\", and have for years. I've kinda grew up around queer spaces and queer discourse from an early age and I've always been interested in gender variance. I've found myself having thoughts like \"it would be really cool to try and look female and see if I could pass\", or \"I wish I could be male and female at the same time\", or \"I feel uncomfortable when I look too masculine, but proud when I look androgynous\". \n\nHowever, there's aspects of a queer male identity that I don't want to let go of. I like being able to hang out as \"one of the guys\", and I like being gay for males. I'm also afraid to lose that sort of privilege, since I already have my experiences invalidated oftentimes just existing as an autistic gay guy.\n\n I don't really mind terms like \"dude\" or \"guy\" at all, and I'm fine with he/him pronouns. However, I hate having chest hair and I don't really feel like a \"man\" (tho the exclamatory form like \"hey, man\" is fine). I also greatly prefer the androgynous form of my name ('Jackie') to the masculine form ('Jack'). When I was a kid, it would particularly infuriate me to be called \"Jack\" - it sounded too rugged and serious, as opposed to the softer, more playful and more mischievous \"Jackie\". \n\nIf it were totally up to me, I'd call myself a nonbinary boy quite openly. I would claim both those identities with no issue. But not only do I have to navigate the cis world, I also have to navigate a queer world where nb identity is often defined in opposition to binary genders. I try and find an nb boy community in the same way as the nb lesbian community, but the nb boy community is mostly soft-masc AFAB people and I don't exactly identify w/ that.

I've been on T (with their knowledge, if not their blessing) for about 2.5 years. I've changed my legal name and I live openly as a nonbinary trans person.\n\nBut I've never let my mom see my facial hair, or even told her about it. I shave it whenever I go home (about twice a year). She has a lot of issues with my medical transition, and remains totally unprepared to deal with the concept. \n\nBack when I came out, she was very focused on \"making sure\" that I wasn't going \"all the way\" with my transition, and wouldn't \"become a guy.\" It's clear that she thinks being nonbinary means not-transitioning-in-any-overt-way, no matter what I say, and she clings to that. She tried to get me to swear I would not grow facial hair (.... somehow, despite going on T. She's a nurse, so you would think she knows how hormones work, but no.) I declined to make that promise, but honestly, I also downplayed it a lot because she was freaking out. Eventually we hit a point where I had done my due diligence by explaining that yes, I am really actually trans and really actually transitioning and might one day be read as a (feminine) guy, and she decided to ignore that, and I gave her some time to process for the sake of family peace.\n\nI was hoping that as time passed, she would chill out a bit and we could have a more calm conversation. But she hasn't. She's worked on my pronouns, which is good, but that's it. And it's just not sustainable to keep hiding my normal appearance from her. So I'm gearing up for The Conversation. But I'm afraid that she's going to accuse me of misleading her (by letting her live in denial) and/or just totally flip out all over again.\n\nDoes anybody have advice?

I have long hair, I take care of my eyebrows, I wear a little eyeliner sometimes, I'll wear \"feminine\" clothes/jewelry, I shave my armpits, and I like sewing a lot. The first cosplay I ever decided to make was very feminine but I just really wanted to do that cosplay. People question my sexuality frequently \\(myself included\\) because apparently I come across feminine sometimes. And honestly it makes me feel really good when that happens. I think I would prefer he/him pronouns because that's what I'm so used to but I wouldn't have any objection to someone referring to me as they/them or she/her. I don't put a lot of weight on it.\n\nBut to the point, I don't know if I'm nonbinary or how I can know for sure or if I'm even allowed to be. I almost feel like I shouldn't be posting this. I feel like I'm doing something wrong just for questioning it. And I'm really sorry if it's inappropriate for me to even be here or if I said something offensive. I've never talked to anyone about this and I just needed to let it out somewhere.\n\n\\*Edit: Thank you all so soooo much! I didn't know what kind of responses to expect but they are all overwhelmingly positive and supportive. I could not be more grateful. You have given me so much to think about and I feel a lot more at ease about exploring gender. This is such a beautiful community and I appreciate every single one of you.

Thanks for having a rad subreddit with a rad community. I'm AMAB and ... maybe genderfluid? or transfemme? or enby? Or ... I don't know?\n\nI've been struggling a lot for the past week to come to terms with how / who to refer to myself as and I was hoping some of the more experienced folk around here could help talk me through what the heck is happening.\n\nOver the past several months, I've been doing a lot of good, hard mental work. I've broken through a lot of my longstanding depression and anxiety, and gotten a much stronger grip on my life. I've done this by finding and making peace with my internal critic, who lives in my head and judges me for not being like everyone else.\n\nUnexpectely, this had gender-identity fallout for me last week. On my commute I started seeing trans themes in some of my favorite pieces of art -- and identifying with them -- and then, I asked myself a question that I'd asked many times and always stopped myself before answering: am I a man?\n\nAnd the answer was: no. You're super not, dude.\n\nEver since then I can't wear most of my old clothes. My name still sounds fine. Parts of my body feel ... off (body hair, facial hair). I now vividly REMEMBER hating my genitals but I've also had 20 years since puberty to get used to them. \n\nI feel most comfortable referring to myself with she/her pronouns and talking in my upper register. However, when I slip into networking or dealing / discussion I find my voice dropping and feel masculinity settle into me. Which feels itchy. It passes after 20 minutes or so. \n\nI've found my fashion sense revert to 90s grunge -- the fashion of my adolescence. The first thing I did the day after I saw it was dye my hair purple and cut thumbholes in a thermal. I've remembered wishing I were Angela when I watched My So Called Life. Fortunately, her layering plaid and grunge gives me \n\nThis does not change the fact that I am a goddam mess.\n\nI've since started to see a therapist. I suspect, if being trans had been something i could consider in my teens without my brain shutting it down with depression/anxiety, I would have been a trans-woman. Now, though, I've spend so long socialized male that I've made peace with some of it.\n\nWhich almost makes things harder, because I sometimes feel it trying to erase the female or nb parts.\n\nAny thought / advice?", "date": "2018-05-20 03:59:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8kqddw/whatwho_the_heck_am_i/", "author": "hlarsson"}, {"title": "First pridefest was pretty dope.", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-20 04:46:36", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8kql7l/first_pridefest_was_pretty_dope/", "author": "_oMeGa_"}, {"title": "How about no?", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-20 04:46:51", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8kql98/how_about_no/", "author": "DoppioConPanda"}, {"title": "So I did it.

Some of you may recall my previous posts.  I have come to identify as non-binary, but as a married father, I face enormous pressure from my wife to present and act as a typical cis-male.\n\nMy dysphoria seems to come in waves, and the peaks can be weeks or even months apart, it seems, but last night, my wife gave me criticism for continuing to shave my legs in spite of the fact that I keep getting razor rash and ingrown hairs.  It's hard to blame her because I look like I have some disgusting skin disease on many days, but the honest truth is that I feel the compulsion to shave because I so strongly dislike my masculine body hair.\n\nIt's become an ongoing source of conflict between us.  She reminded me that when we got married, she married a man, not an enby.  In a way, it's really unfair to both of us that things turned out this way.  I feel like I'm trying to live authentically, but she sees me as the man she loved turning into something she doesn't want to be with.  She said that if I had presented as enby from the beginning, she wouldn't have married me.\n\nBut frankly, *I* did not know that I was enby until recently.  But as I've said before, there are signs going back years that I diligently covered up and ignored.  Growing up, I was harshly criticised for my persona as it was and I was taught repeatedly by my sexist, narcissistic, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic father that *female is inferior* and he was raising me to be a *real man*.  It should come as a surprise to no one that I censored my own thoughts and feelings that it took well into my fourth decade of life to even allow myself to acknowledge what I feel inside.\n\nI finally said to my wife around bedtime today, \"Non-binary is transgender.\"  I can't remember everything I said, but I told her that I feel like I can't tell her the truth because **telling the truth hurts her**, and I can't keep secrets because **keeping secrets hurts her**, so I feel like **I'm doing wrong no matter what I say**.  I think we're going to have some more intensely uncomfortable talks in the coming days because I'm no longer willing to pretend to be something I'm not.\n\nThe thing that just drives me insane is that I feel like she is doing something to me whether she is even aware of it or not.  She is so terrified of this change that she is sending small, but very powerful signals to me that my enbiness is completely unacceptable, to the point that I feel like I'm stepping out of line when I insist on expressing myself.  I'm not even allowed to wear dresses around my own house.\n\nMaybe next thing, I can actually tell my hair stylist that I want a feminine hairstyle.\n\nOh yeah, so here's the other thing.  As I said, I've been shaving my body in spite of getting ingrown hairs and rash.  Well, my wife jerked away from me in bed and even pulled away hard as I tried to hug her, and told me that this is because the stubble on my belly pricks her like a cactus, even just a few hours after a fresh shave.  As much as I love my wife, I find this hard to believe.  For the woman I love to pull away from me when I try to hug her hurts nearly more than I have words to describe.

It hurts so bad it makes me wonder if the two of us would be better off if we separated.  I want to be loved as I am.\n\nI about feel physically sick just thinking about it.  Why does it have to be so bleeping hard to be me?!\n\n***\n\nTL;DR; I finally self-applied the word transgender today.

After some supportive comments and suggestions, I set back out into the world with a new point of view. \n\nI started with Instagram, (a suggestion I was given), and sought out lovely enby people to follow and just find encouragement from. Forgot this was an old account and my (incredibly bigoted) oldest brother followed me and liked one of my pictures that I tagged as enby. Deleted the tag. Deleted Instagram. Again.\n\nMeanwhile on the presentation front, I did some research and bought a compression bra, just as a starter binder in hopes it would help kick start me into this whole gender expression thing. Turns out it was kinda just a waste of money and stretched out quickly to a point where it did as much compression as a regular sports bra minus the comfort. After landing myself a job, I bought a custom binder as a birthday gift to myself, discovering that I'm one of those people that would rather drop a bunch of money on one thing and having it last rather than a little money but have to keep making repeat purchases.  Which isn't an enby fact, but it is still a lesson I learned. I'm kinda at a standstill as far as physical representation, considering there's a lot of things that I can't do because of work dress code policy and the sheer amount of time I no longer have for myself because of my job. \n\nMy days off don't feel like time for me, it feels like recovery. I spend so much time around people with no recharge time, my legs hurt, my back hurts, I feel exhausted. Sometimes I'm caught off guard by the sound of my own name. Sometimes people will call me sir, which I think is just an accident most of the time, but it almost feels... nice(?) when people have to do a double take? Like HA! I almost had you! I know how feminine I look and sound, sometimes I wish I could change it, sometimes I don't care at all. \n\nI don't actually mind appearing feminine, I just wish I had more control over it. I don't really know how else to explain that. I have my binder now, I want to take it for a test run. Get my hair cut and just feel comfortable again. Not to mention its super hot here now and this long shit that I'm putting up with has got to stop. \n\nThis just feels like venting but I don't have anyone to talk to. I have one trans friend but he lives a couple states away and he works a lot. My boyfriend doesn't really know much about all this but keeps telling me he loves me for who I am (even though my brain tries to tell me he's lying). I don't know. I feel like I need to talk to more people who know what I'm going through.\n\n", "date": "2018-05-23 05:11:42", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8lgtgn/how_i_feel_now/", "author": "celestialcerebrum"}, {"title": "Top 10 Unisex Names by Year &amp; Gender-slant (For people choosing a name)", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-23 08:17:07", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8lhpbu/top_10_unisex_names_by_year_genderslant_for/", "author": "A_boy_and_his_cat"}, {"title": "It happened!", "text": "Thank you to everyone who was very supportive.

Not SUPER realistic which was actually a draw for me but trans men have said they have used a urinal with them. \n\nI wanted one to alleviate *some* bottom dysphoria and also while out and about I hate sitting on public toilet seats. I\u2019m very happy to announce that I\u2019ve had zero \u201cpeeing down my leg\u201d mishaps and it is nearly invisible when I pack with it (and super comfy!). I just cut a tiny hole on the back flap of men\u2019s briefs/boxer briefs and it stays in place and packs up. I am on the heavier side (5\u20196\u201d, 38 waist men\u2019s pants). \n\nIt was important to me to find one that didn\u2019t have a bulge as I\u2019m not trying to be read as male. So far I love it. I bought the harness that\u2019s intended to go with it but honestly didn\u2019t need it and found it to complicate things more.\n\n\n", "date": "2018-05-28 20:43:42", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8mt835/stp_packer_review_for_those_afab_humans_interested/", "author": "cadenem"}, {"title": "Help support our non-gendered strategy board game option!", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-29 00:39:31", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8mutu9/help_support_our_nongendered_strategy_board_game/", "author": "CandyandPhilosophy"}, {"title": "Considering SRS?", "text": "Has anyone here had \\(or is thinking of having\\) SRS?

I'm currently questioning.\n\nSo, uhh, I guess this sentiment pops up a lot, but basically I *really don't want to be a \"special snowflake\"* or whatever.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about gender recently and I'm not sure what being nonbinary is all about. So, I'm AFAB and have always considered myself cis\u2014like, I don't really think I've just thought much about this. I found out about being nonbinary and thought it sounded very intriguing, but I'm not sure what being NB really means.\n\nTbh, I think I have \"discomfort\" over my breasts, but I'm not sure if it's dysphoria or something else. I have been avoiding wearing bras for some time because of it, and I wish I could have a flatter chest. I've always wanted a smaller bust size, from when I was young, but I don't know why exactly. I bought a binder but I don't actually wear it since I wear a lot of layers. I am planning on perhaps wearing it during the summer though. Maybe it's just because I think it's cuter and more childish that way, since I don't know if it's a gender thing or just an eating disorder thing (since I have anorexia). I did feel bad about my breasts before my eating disorder flared up though.\n\nIdk, as for pronouns and names and socially considering myself a woman I have no idea what that means, like to consider yourself a woman? I don't relate personally to talks about feminism sometimes but I don't know if that's just because I've not really experienced things that women and girls typically experienced or not. I sort of wish I were described as being more boyish or whatever, instead of feminine or womanly, idk. One time I got a short haircut and was really happy when my mom told me that someone at the salon was confused about my gender. About pronouns I don't know. I don't like being referred to in the third person for some reason\u2014like \"she\" makes me feel awkward, but I don't know if \"they\" would be any better.\n\nThe thing is that I'm not sure what it means to be NB rather than,  idk, just want to mess around with gender roles, and I don't want to be appropriating an identity that isn't mine.

Younger generations are starting to care much less about gender binaries, and have mostly had them forced upon them from an early age anyway. So why would a well\\-meaning journalist reinforce those binaries in a world that is becoming less concerned by the gender binary? I would have thought that a story focused on the 'gender divide' would not itself police that divide, and instead at least raise the issue of gender variant people and what this may mean for social equity into the future.

I had a double mastectomy back in 2014, and at the time it was the right decision. I think, mostly, it was still the right decision overall. But I've been struggling with it more and more lately. When I decided on surgery, I was on testosterone and had been binding daily for a couple of years or so. I was identifying as male and I was OVER wearing a binder. I was tired of having bruises on my hips, I was tired of not being able to breathe or eat comfortably, and I was tired of being absolutely miserable in the summer. It was time.\n\nAnd now that I'm settling comfortably into my nonbinary identity, I guess in my daily life I'm still glad I have a flat chest, and I feel confident about myself out in public. But in my personal life, it's a struggle. I miss my old chest in the bedroom, and as I get older my desire to have children gets stronger and I'm really having a hard time reconciling the fact that I'll never be able to breastfeed future babies. Like, that's a really emotional issue for me. I feel like in my pursuit of happiness that I perhaps made a misstep in my choices. I don't know. \n\nI'm becoming more and more aware as the years go by that I didn't necessarily change my body for ME so much as I changed my body in order to thrive in society. I never hated my chest, but I knew that I would never \"pass\" out in the world the way I was. It just sucks. It sucks that some of us have to make these choices so we can survive when if we were in a vacuum, we wouldn't need to otherwise. \n\nI think I mostly needed to vent about it but I'm also wondering if anyone else has similar experiences or feelings along those lines? And what have you done to help ease that inner turmoil? \n\nThanks for listening.

I had not truly acknowledged it to myself before. I came out to him at the same time I came out to myself.\n\nHe was accepting but also at times struggled with it. He seems to have gotten past that though and I think it's been over a year since its been remotely an issue. He uses my proper pronouns and defends me. He went to support group with me.

In our small community, I've found a lot of love, and some things I've noticed. Everyone expresses differently.\n\nThe well\\-known image that people seem to have of a nonbinary person is an afab teenager with buzzed hair and a jean jacket. This is, for about a year or two, what I thought I needed to be. I spent a lot of time and effort trying to push a look that was androgynous and punk without being actually *out*.\n\nThe first time I saw an amab nonbinary person, I thought they looked like sunshine through my computer screen. Their hair was shoulder\\-length and their eyeliner was fantastic. I'm an afab person, but I saw this enby and realized suddenly, there's no right way to *be* nonbinary. While this is glorious and made me feel immediately more welcome, I realized that I couldn't do the regular nonbinary look. I had the short hair with shaved sides and the jean jackets for a year, but when I grew my hair out to my shoulders, I found that it was the look that* reall*y validated me. I call it my skater boy haircut.\n\nWe have gender roles, even as nonbinary people. Boys are expected to have short hair and sports, girls are expected to have long hair and makeup, and nonbinary people are expected to serve up our most extra and most androgynous looks. Thing is, we don't have a gender to pass as. We're a concept that isn't accepted or really recognized a lot of the time. This realization changed my life. I don't have to pass as anything. I can wear a dress or a suit and it doesn't matter what my body looks like, it doesn't define me. Your body doesn't define you, and you can wear anything that makes you happy.\n\nClothes and looks have no gender, and they don't define us. Wear makeup if you want, wear bowties if you want, wear anything you want. You are who you are, and nobody and nothing can change that.\n\nI'm a nonbinary person, I get dysphoria, so I want a binder, but I also like the feeling of skirts on my legs, so I'll wear my binder and a skirt. Maybe the next day I'll need a break from binding, and I'll wear a bra and a t\\-shirt and jeans, and just go on my way, and I'm still me, I'm still an enby. I wore a dress and heels to Prom, and it was still a nonbinary\\-ass person in all the photos. Clothes and gender have become separate to me.\n\nThis isn't to say that you shouldn't be trying to look androgynous or have the \"nonbinary look\", if that's what makes you feel good, get it and hold onto that. Honestly and truly, I hope every single enby finds what *they're* comfortable with. Do what makes you happy, be yourself.

I never know what term is appropriate to me since it's all so complex. Now I don't even know because I have a dilemma where I am fully aware that I am female and therefore prefer female pronouns (hence the cis-female part), but due to my body dysphoria I obtained gender dysphoria and now I randomly internally yell \"I'm not female!\" or feel uncomfortable when I am referred to as a female. If I could magically get rid of my genitalia, I would (apparently that's called neutrois and I think it's of the umbrella of gender-neutral). I don't know if that would be agender or gender neutral (as I still do not know the difference) but along with that, sometimes I feel I am also genderflux or bigender because I fluctuate between gender behaviors and that makes me feel like there's two halves of my identity. I can't go around saying I'm cis-female/neutrois/genderflux because not only is that confusing and conflicting, it's just silly. I did do some research and I think I just might be a demi-girl (but the gender-flux slightly still fits so I dunno). The problem is that I still wish I didn't have the physical aspects of either gender - which might be androgyny, I think? I think Agender doesn't fit because it's not the same as in-between, I guess. Maybe that's too far but if I could keep a feminine form without all the nonsensical genitalia, that'd be fine by me. Maybe I'm a demi-flux? I don't know... I think about it and at certain points I feel feminine (like when I'm flirty), then I fluctuate and feel masculine (like when I'm angry or undergoing inferiority complex symptoms and desire to feel powerful), and then when I am completely turned off by human anatomy, I feel neither male nor female. I don't know if that's agender, gender-neutral, genderless, or what but I just don't want to be in this body I've got. I've got another kind of dysphoria that's kinda tied with all this but it's too controversial to discuss here... *sigh* Anyway, I'm just really confused and no amount of research seems to help, it just exacerbates the issue further.

No one should be doubted about their stated gender, and it's ridiculous because I have been out basically my whole life, with family who finds it obvious, and a documented history of my years of being dually male and female.  She mentally edited me into a woman, minimally pretended to care/believe when I explained it to her over and over and over, shamed and guilted me if I said I was uncomfortable/having trouble trusting her/unable to be myself around her, shamed me anytime I acted male, said something maximally dysphoric (you're all curves, no edges, calling me a woman when I kept telling her not to, calling me her girlfriend when I said I wasn't).  She reinforced every female quality and behavior and pointedly ignored anything male, like when you're training an animal.  It was painfully slow to change, like when it was clear I'd leave she tried to say \"handsome\" but said it so inauthentically and jokingly it was worse.  She kept touching my breasts when I asked her not to, said I could fight her off if I'd wanted.  She kept ignoring my stated discomfort with PiV sex, pressured/manipulated me into what I now can tell was sexual behaviors that made me more attractively female in her eyes, no contraception (she's AMAB), made fun of me for being worried about a condom breaking and being distressed by taking Plan B.  I kept making excuses for her (because I'm dysfunctional about deserving mistreatment after narcissistic abuse/codependency from childhood).

I made boundaries and set ultimatums and she came to realize how horrible she had been, fell apart.

But she keeps telling me to \"stop dwelling\" and \"not live in the past\" when my damage or emotions surface.  It's gaslighting and not ok, especially because I would never have had sex with someone who was seeing me as a woman and I'm repulsed and shaken and fight-or-flight anytime I have to think about those two months.  Our \"anniversary\" is coming up and she agreed we don't have to celebrate it, can move it to when she first accepted me. I don't want to break up with her because she's otherwise perfect for me (in tons of ways) and I know that she is late in emotionally maturing (after her own child abuse).

Sorry if this has been discussed before.\n\nChapter 4 (page 47-67) contains the results of one of the largest transgender surveys conducted at the time in the US (27k+ respondents). The survey is very thorough. For the most part the respondents where split into 4 groups: trans woman, trans men, non-binary people and cross dressers. Here are some of the statistics:\n\n&gt;Gender identity: 35% Non-binary, 33% Transwoman, 29% Transmen, 3% Crossdressers\n\n&gt;Pronouns respondents ask people to use: 37% he/his, 37% she/her, 29% they/their, 20% do not ask people to use specific pronouns, 4% no pronouns (only name), 4% other pronouns than the ones listed, 2% ze/hir.\n\n&gt;Sexual orientation non-binary people: 34% queer, 21% pansexual, 17% asexual, 10% bisexual, 8% homosexual, 8% sexual orentation not listed, 2% heterosexual.\n\n&gt;Gender that people who do not know they are non-binary usually assume they are: 58% Non-trans woman, 19% Assumptions vary, 17% Non-trans man, 2% Trans man, 2% Others cannot tell their genders, 1% Trans woman, 1% Non-binary.\n\n&gt;53% Sometimes tell others they are non-binary, 44% usually let others assume they are man or woman, 3% always tell others they are non-binary.\n\n&gt;Main reasons for not telling people they are non-binary: 86% most people do not understand so they don't try to explain it, 82% it is easier not to say anything, 63% most people dismiss it as not being a real identity or a \"phase\", 43% they might face violence, 35% they are not ready to tell people they identify as non-binary, 35% the might lose their job or not able to get a job, 24% they might not get the medical care they need.\n\nI was very surprised at how many people identified as non-binary, seeing how little representation there is here on Reddit (both r/ftm and r/mtf are over 3 times the size, and they also seem to be the majority on subs like /asktransgender). \n\nIn a way I shouldn't really be surprised that 58% of non-binary people are seen as a woman vs 17% men, since its socially acceptable for woman to dress as man but not for man to dress as woman, so when most people see a trace of femininity, they'll automatically think woman. But I was really surprised only 5% thought they where trans and/or non-binary. Personally, this is also the reason I don't like to go outside looking more 'feminine' because I don't like how different people treat me when they think I'm a woman.\n\nThe amount of non-binary people that never disclose that they are non-binary and the reasons why weren't very surprising to me, seeing how socially unacceptable it still is, but still made me kind of sad.\n\nThoughts?", "date": "2018-06-11 13:51:50", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8q9ol3/more_nonbinary_people_than_i_thought/", "author": "DylanKing1999"}, {"title": "Question for those identifying with labels other than \"trans\" or \"non-binary\"", "text": "Hello!

If you do, this is great.  This means you have more options when it comes to looking for a therapist (you'll most likely need a letter from them in support of your surgery) as well as locating a surgeon (Dr. Garramone will bill insurance for patients who have out-of-network benefits).  Make sure you understand the fine print of the out-of-network benefits.\nStep 1A: If your insurance does not cover gender-related surgeries, you can appeal this!  There are some great resources out on the internet to help you do this, use Google!  \n\n*Step 2:* Once you know that your insurance will cover such procedures (as they should!) the next thing you want to do is to ask about your deductible and how much it is.  A deductible is something that you need to pay first BEFORE insurance will pay anything.  For example, sometimes it's $500, meaning you need to pay out of pocket $500 before insurance kicks in.  Sometimes people have really high deductibles and in my case it's $2,000.  I'm lucky enough that my employer will cover 90% of that deductible only requiring me to pay $200.  So things like that could happen and you'll want to find out either from parents (if you're using their insurance or your own employer on how that works).  If you're using a government funded plan, you'll want to clarify that information when speaking with the benefits representative. \n\n*Step 3:* Find the procedure policy that indicates what documentation you need to get this surgery covered.  Google top surgery and then the name of your insurance.  This should pull up the policy which will tell you how many letters you need, sometimes it's 2, usually it's just 1.  What the letter should say, for example my letter needed to state how long I was living as my preferred gender and needed specific examples of how my gender dysphoria impacts my daily functions.  You can print out this procedure policy and give it your therapist or doctor, whoever is writing your letter.  This will ensure they include this information in your letter. \n\nInsurance has *30 days* to make a decision on whether or not they will approve a surgery or not, however it typically takes them 5-7 business days.  You'll be notified via snail mail of the approval or denial and from there, you'll either be able to schedule your surgery or file an appeal. There are also great resources out there for a constructing an appeal for an insurance denial.\n\nIt still doesn't feel real and I was happy that I was able to navigate this crazy system.  I worked as an office manager in a Physical Therapy office for 3 years, so I became very familiar with CPT codes, insurance and benefits.

Sorry in advance for the long post...i'll try to sum it up with a tl;dr at the end but no promises :)**\n\nI wanted to share what I hope will be a confidence booster for anyone (like myself) who often struggles with not only self\\-acceptance but anxiety over shopping in the ladies department dressed as a guy/in guy mode/anything that doesn't scream feminine.\n\nOver the past month or so I've kind of forced myself to take some big steps in this journey of self\\-exploration and self\\-acceptance. It all kind of started back in early May when I took a big step of faith and made a bridal appointment at David's Bridal ([read about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8hoqw0/davids_bridal_experience/)). That alone was a huge confidence booster and if you read my linked post, you'll understand why. Since then I've been so much more comfortable in walking into women's stores or the women's department and browsing and trying on clothes, and even being less \"secretive\" that I'm shopping for myself. Most people I've run into don't seem to give me a second glance or even notice there's a guy browsing the racks.\n\nI am still figuring out my identity/expression, but I'm obviously non\\-binary, somewhere between genderfluid, genderqueer or gender nonconforming. I know many people will tell me these terms are quite similar but I'm having trouble settling on one. That said, I'm really unable to present feminine in public at all at the moment. I am married, and my wife is not exactly comfortable with the idea of having a husband who is bending the societal gender boundaries, since this was a revelation I made after we were already married.\n\nSo, being an obvious guy (6'2\", beard, deep voice), I have always found it quite intimidating wander the ladies sections on my own. After my experience at David's Bridal, I've found it easier and easier to shop for myself by myself. Earlier this week I stopped into my local Lane Bryant shop (having heard they were very LGBT friendly), and quietly asked an employee if I could be fitted for a bra (I thought it would help fill out some of my more feminine tops even though I don't really \\*need\\* one), and she said \"oh absolutely!\" and took me back to the dressing room and measured me and asked if I was looking for something in particular. She brought me a few options and left me to try them on, checking on me once or twice and once I settled on one she cashed me out and we got talking and I told her I was going out to a party in public in a dress for the first time with friends and she seemed legitimately happy for me, and it was wonderful!! Having bought my bra, I could resist trying on a few dresses and tops while I was there so I picked out a few and after trying them on (to no avail, unfortunately, wrong sizes and I was running late to a work event at this point) she asked me \"how did those dresses work out?\" which was simply thrilling, openly talking to someone about the dresses I tried on and what I liked about them and what not.\n\nNext day I decided to take this boost of confidence and stop in to Torrid (also very LGBT friendly) at my local mall. I browsed for a bit and one of the salesladies asked me if I needed anything so I asked her about some shoes I was looking for and she brought me out a couple pairs in different sizes and let me tell you \\- in guy mode, in a ladies store, walking around in four\\-inch block heels was an experience, let me tell you!! I had already picked out a few dresses to try on, but being in guy mode I didn't have a bra on, so I marched my confident self over to the bra racks, found one in my size, and confidently asked for a dressing room.

Please, call me Jay.\n\nI'm a college student, a psychology major. I transferred to my university after 2 long ass years at community college. The community I grew up in, and spent near 21 years in, is very much conservative and religious. I'd never met anyone who wasn't straight or not strictly born male or female. Sure, they were and are there, but I only saw them from a distance, and they never stuck around for long. After coming out, they never returned the following school year. They were all demonized by the church or ostracized by the school. Anyway, after I transferred I made some friends my first semester, all of them in the marching band. We never really hung out after season was over though. So I decided to rush a sorority that's associated with the school of music.\n\nThat second semester is what I like to call both the self discovery semester and the beginning of my depression year. Long story short, my Big is gay af, and one of the most amazing humans I've ever met. In fact, a good 3/4 of the sorority is either not straight, not binary, or both. My little homophobic/transphobic ass went for a spin. I learned and I grew. I got really overwhelmed with social things and subsequently came out of some of my social anxiety. I also got overwhelmed with school work and learned the hard way that my major at the time, education, wasn't for me. Start the depression year. It was also the semester I said 'fuck it', and changed my major to psychology. I told no one. Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.\n\nThe beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major.\n\nIn August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September.\n\nIn November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic.\n\nBiromantic asexual.\n\nIt wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit.\n\nThe feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype.\n\nThere are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.\n\nI don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament.\n\nI don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me. Some part of me desperately wants out, and I have no idea if it's a suppressed part of me, or if it's the Jason I've suppressed all my life.\n\nI am Jason when I can admit it to myself, which is most often when I've been drinking. Other times I just settle for some version of what I was assigned.", "date": "2018-06-15 00:13:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8r6pul/feel_free_to_ignore_this/", "author": "timtimmytimmers"}, {"title": "I have a strong feeling i am agender and i would like some advice/support", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-06-15 00:39:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8r6vr4/i_have_a_strong_feeling_i_am_agender_and_i_would/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Would my name pass as gender neutral or is it too masculine?", "text": "Hello.

I\u2019m interested in finding out if anyone is, or was, in a similar situation to me or might have any advice.\n\nI\u2019ve had gender dysphoria to varying degrees since I was a teenager, dealing with it in various ways such as choosing a male name, wearing  men\u2019s clothes (or masculine clothes designed for women), having short hair, etc. I\u2019ve had other mental problems such as OCD, anxiety and depression, which I\u2019ve treated with anti-depressants (I\u2019ve been off them for 10 years now though), CBT and psychoanalytical therapy. A couple of years ago I registered with a gender clinic and have now been prescribed a low dose of testosterone gel, after about a year of counselling with them. \n\nI don't have such intense body dysphoria as I used to, because I've come to terms with my anatomy as being just \"my body\" rather than a \"woman's body\". But I\u2019d love to not be seen as a woman in society. I would prefer to be read as male more frequently by the general public. When I look at myself, I think I look fairly masculine, but it seems others don\u2019t always read me that way and that gets me down sometimes. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m considering HRT. \n\nHowever I am also a bit worried about starting HRT. I think my tendency towards anxiety and obsessive thoughts are making the situation worse. I would really love to be able to pass as male, or at least look more ambiguous so people don\u2019t instantly gender me as female, without having to risk the side effects of T. I don\u2019t want all of them and I know you can\u2019t tell which ones will happen unless you try it. So it feels like a bit of a gamble to me. The clinic haven't been that helpful in terms of guidance, pretty much just saying it's up to me! It's also hard to get frequent appointments with them due to severe short-staffing, so I don't feel very supported.\n\nThe main things I want are to have a more masculine face and body shape, and a lower voice. I can already grow a fair bit of facial hair naturally - not as much as a cis male but I have to shave every day to look clean-cut! But I don\u2019t especially want a beard. I\u2019d like to feel better in myself too, less anxious, and I've heard some people online and in real life say that T has done that for them. Although I guess that\u2019s very subjective and personal.\n\nPossible side effects I\u2019m worried about: acne (I am prone to it even pre-T), head hair loss, possibly gaining fat, and maybe not liking genital changes that might happen. \n\nI have connected with a voice coach, who at our first meeting said I should be able to get into an androgynous or even male range without T! And I\u2019m getting that on the NHS (I\u2019m in the UK) so it\u2019ll be free. So that\u2019s one glimmer of hope for me at the moment. \n\nSo as things stand now, I have the gel, I\u2019ve tried a bit of it to see how it feels to apply it, and that\u2019s about as far as I\u2019ve got! For me, the question is not \u201cam I transgender?\u201d but rather, \u201cwhat should I do about it?\u201d I know some people socially transition before starting hormones, but I don\u2019t really know where to start with that, beyond what I\u2019ve already done in terms of my presentation. I\u2019m quite a reserved person IRL, so to announce to people that they should see me as a man now feels difficult for me.

Until recently I would just identify as \"male-by-default\" or, more jokingly \"gender apathetic.\"   But of late I've been doing a lot more soul-searching on this topic and have begun to realize that I in fact belong in the androgynous/non-binary category.   Although I was already leaning towards this assumption, I decided to see if the internet, in all it's infinite and terrifying glory, had any sorts of \"tests\" available that could shed light on my gender identity in a relatively objective manner.   I found several, ranging from silly, buzz-feed style \"What Hogwarts House do you belong in?\" to what appear to be more serious psychological evaluations.  \n\nSo my question is:  At least for the more \"serious\" gender identity evaluations out there, do you think there is merit to such tests?   Has anyone else taken these and were you surprised/skeptical/offended by the results or questions?   I found some of the questions to be a bit odd, many seemed to suggest that one binary gender or the other was better at different intellectual subjects (i.e language arts versus math), and several just pertained to stereotypical gender-role interests (power tools and cars for men, clothing and sewing for women).   I was identified as androgynous or non-binary in all that I took, though many of the questions were very similar across tests, and I wonder if it wasn't just my pre-existing assumptions that influenced these results.  As someone trained in a \"hard\" science I tend to take psychology with a grain of salt.   I'm not saying it isn't a valid and useful line of research, just that every field of study has it's limitations and potential biases.   Anyway, thoughts, opinions on these tests?\n\nLinks to the two mentioned in the title:\n\n[SAGE](http://hemingways.org/GIDinfo/sage/test.htm)\n\n[COGIATI](http://www.transsexual.org/cogiati_english.html)\n\n\n", "date": "2018-06-17 23:14:30", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8ruvia/thoughtsopinions_on_gender_identity_evaluations/", "author": "Brigalicious"}, {"title": "Loneliness &amp; lack of progress", "text": "Honestly, I've been having a really hard time lately mentally/emotionally, and a large part of that is due to feeling so alone and isolated.

I read the forums and health guides for a while, consulted a doctor about it, and got a prescription for T with informed consent. \n\nMy mother flipped out. I'm an adult and should be able to make my own decisions and she knew I was genderqueer but the news I was trying to change my physical self was unbearable to her. I tried to have her talk to my doctor who told her T is relatively safe and they could monitor me for any negative health concerns of which I currently have none. She wasn't reassured and kept panicking and cried whenever I tried to talk to her. \n\nThe last straw was this week, I took my last injection from my first script and tried to make sure I had the refill bottle handy, turns out my mother stole it and the rest of my needles. I'm living with my parents so she had access to my bedroom and she stole my medication because, as she says, she \"panicked\" and \"wanted me to be safe.\"\n\nThe ONLY way I could convince her to give me my meds back without calling the police was to promise I would stop taking testosterone for a few months so we could discuss it more in depth.

My older brother smoked cigarettes for a very long time but she never stole his cigarettes, and she doesn't take weed away from my younger brother.

She gave my meds back because I promised to stop taking them for a while and taking them behind her back would make me as untrustworthy as she is, but I feel disgusting letting her manipulate what I choose to do with my own body. I immediately bought a lock box for my valuables, including the meds, because I don't fucking trust her anymore.

About 4 months ago I bawled my eyes out after everything clicked in my brain, I'm non-binary. \n\nI'm living in Los Angeles this summer, but I was born and raised in Ohio. I attended the Saturday night of Los Angeles Pride, the night it reached capacity. Immediately I was gendered and assumed to be a lesbian by my lyft driver who was a lesbian. She assumed all the girls I was in the car with were also gay women. Two of the girls are bi and the other was an ally. None of them know I am non-binary, but all were very polite about not pushing me to answer any questions. I don't know them that well as we are just all here on the same summer program and hadn't met until a month ago. Our lyft driver then said some transphobic things and it made me and everyone else so uncomfortable. It was a weird car ride. \n\nWhen we arrived we met up with a man from our program. His face was painted rainbow and he was so excited for pride. After telling the story about our lyft driver to him, I explained I lied to her about being gay so it'd be less uncomfortable and easier to get through. He then asked \"well what are you then?\" Even after explaining I wasn't up to discussing it he pressed me 3 different times the rest of the night. I didn't understand why it was so important. \n\nI'm extremely femme presenting (AFAB ) and I wish I could appear more androgynous just for other people's sake of understanding but I am comfortable in my femininity. My physicality is extremely feminine and I love it, but I shaved my head recently and I'm just always assumed to be a shaved head lesbian girl. \n\nAt pride I just felt so dominated by gay men. I don't want to take anything away from them, but I just was disappointed with the space. I didn't feel free there. I thought it may have been because I was there with acquaintances but I felt all the MCs only ever hyped up gay men. Gay women were talked about even less and I think I only heard something about gender nonconforming people once, and it seemed like an after thought. \n\nI guess I should've learned more about the festival itself before attending. I thought the booths would have more community driven stations, which were there but not in the way i thought. Everyone just wanted to get drunk it seemed. I don't drink much and hate being high in public spaces... it was a huge party I felt like I shouldn't have been invited to. I looked enough like I should be there but still felt people were making the wrong assumptions. \n\nI just feel like I've lost the momentum I was gaining with my confidence. There are so many people I've had conversations with about gender who don't get it yet. I'm scared to explain it to them. My best friend in LA right now rolled their eyes when I corrected myself with someone's pronouns. My partner and I are long distance this summer and he's the person who understands it the best. I feel lost without being close to him and I feel lost being so closeted in a place I thought was the freest place for people like me.

I started painting them maybe a month after I started when I realized that no one knew anything about me and I had an opportunity to pretend I did it all the time. At first, I got a few glances, but no one really said anything (except for one amazing woman) until the office Christmas party, where everyone had been drinking. That's when all of the women were finding excuses to come tell me how much they loved my nails. It was a really great experience because I learned that just because no one is saying anything doesn't mean they disapprove. Since then I've started adding jewelry to my outfits and often get swept up in conversations with women where we talk about each others jewelry and maintenance etc.\n\nA couple of weeks ago I started seeing a therapist to help me navigate the external transition I hope to make, and they mentioned something about the rules we make for ourselves that make it difficult to be ourselves. It's nothing I haven't heard, but in that moment it really struck a chord. I realized I don't want to live a life controlled by fear of rejection or retribution. I also realized that I'm doing exactly that. It's not actual retribution that's stopping me. It's fear. Just fear.\n\nI went to grab a couple of drinks with that amazing woman I mentioned earlier and opened up to her about my identity and we connected and everything was great. This morning when I woke up, I was struggling to decide what top to wear. I grabbed a tight-ish shirt. I grabbed a pink shirt. I looked at some more of my  masculine cut t-shirts and felt frustrated. Suddenly, I realized I was struggling because I really wanted to wear something more feminine, and none of the masculine clothes I typically lean on to achieve that were working for me today. So I grabbed the blouse I bought a few weeks ago, ironed it, drew on some really simple cat eyes and left. No pre-meditation. Today was just the fucking day. I hope the day I walk out the door in a dress is right around the corner :)\n\nBefore I started seeing this  therapist, I was really concerned about how to go about telling my coworkers that I'm non-binary and how to tell them to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I figured after I told them, I could start presenting myself however I see fit.

Everyone I know who binds does so in a way that pushes the chest down and appears to cause some back issues.  I was wondering if there is a way to bind more upwards.  When I use my hands in the mirror, I love the flat look created when I press my chest in and upwards, but I don\u2019t see how that can be replicated through binding.

I thought I would post it, get some feedback and it might be useful to other people. I used a form letter I found on a nb tumblr as a starting reference. I'm 39, live across the country from my parents and have not lived with them for 20 years. I did however work with them and my brother for more than a decade and saw them regularly (if not daily), until about 18 months ago when my wife and I moved our family. My relationship with them is complicated and I'm not sure I'd even have one, if not for my wife and kids. I still feel like I need to come out to them before I really come out openly in public. I plan on mailing them a letter with a flash drive full of articles and local support group info for them. I don't discuss issues of name change, because I already have a gender neutral name and have no plans to change it.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDear Mom and Dad,\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have been thinking a lot about how and when to tell you this. That\u2019s why I decided to write you this letter. I don\u2019t identify as male, but instead what is known as \u201cnonbinary\u201d. This means I don\u2019t identify within the binary male/female definitions of gender, but something outside that. Along with that, I don\u2019t feel comfortable using male pronouns for myself (he/him/his/himself), but prefer to use they/them/their/themself. I know this may seem confusing and unfamiliar, but I have some resources to help you understand. Please read through all of this letter and look at the articles and resources I\u2019ve provided for you before talking to me about this.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As I said, I identify as nonbinary. Although this might seem new or unusual, it is an established and valid gender identity. There is a long history, across many different cultures, of more than two distinct gender identities. The term nonbinary falls under the umbrella of Transgender, as I do not identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. Nonbinary is itself an umbrella term that encompasses many distinct gender identities, but all are outside or between the male/female binary. I understand that using they/them pronouns for me may be confusing at first, but it is commonly used for individual people and has a history of prominent usage dating through centuries of English language and literature. A frequent response to asking for use of they/them pronouns is that it is exclusively for groups of people and not individuals, but they/them is used regularly in everyday language for people whose gender identity is unknown. If someone lets you know you missed a phone call you might respond \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d, if you found a coat on your bed after a party you might ask \u201cDid someone forget their jacket?\u201d and so on. Along with these pronouns, I would appreciate if you would use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as \u201cchild\u201d or \u201cour oldest\u201d instead of \u201cson\u201d, \u201cparent\u201d instead of \u201cfather\u201d, \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d instead of \u201chusband\u201d, \u201csibling\u201d instead of \u201cbrother\u201d and so on. If you\u2019re unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 I know this all may sound scary and uncertain and that\u2019s completely normal. I have my own fears and anxieties surrounding being open about my gender identity, but I ultimately feel it\u2019s a positive and necessary step and would appreciate your utmost support in this. Adjusting to talking to and about me in gender neutral terms may take some time and effort, but it would make me much more comfortable if you could try to do so. I know this is a lot to take in and there can be many strong emotions involved, which is why I have included some resources to give you more information, as well as to direct you to support groups in your area for parents and family of gender variant people. All of which I think could be helpful to you. If after exploring these you still have questions for me or need more resources, I can help with that. I have already discussed all of this with \\[spouse\\] and she has told me she\u2019s willing and available to discuss it with you as well.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I hope you understand that I still love you both and this doesn\u2019t change our relationship. I still love \\[spouse\\], \\[child 1\\] and \\[child 2\\]. Our marriage and family are intact and she is giving me her full understanding and support. My gender identity does not change anything about who I am, apart from the pronouns and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender identity, I\u2019m not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be myself more authentically in all my relationships. I will try to be as patient and calm as possible when answering any questions you may have, but there are some things that don\u2019t need to be asked. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender. When exploring resources about nonbinary people and identities, you may find a lot of personal accounts of individuals pursuing many different types of gender expression and physical/medical transitions, all of which are valid, but may not apply to me personally. There are many people who identify as Transgender and nonbinary, not all of which fit in the \u201cborn in the wrong body\u201d narrative. Personally, I don\u2019t know at this time what transitioning will look like for me and it might change over time. While I would love and appreciate your support, I also ask that you please respect my privacy in this regard. You are free to disclose and discuss my gender identity with others, but I ask that you would do so with the same respect and sense of personal privacy you always have, as your child and an individual and not in terms of my body parts.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 Thank you for reading all of this. I\u2019ve included links to several articles and resources for you. As I said before, please read through all of this letter and the provided resources, before talking to me about this.\u00a0\n\nLove,\n\n\\[Name\\]", "date": "2018-06-28 22:10:43", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8unvyl/coming_out_letter_to_my_parents/", "author": "coreyisweird"}, {"title": "(AMAB) Starting to like myself for the first time in years.

Just plain feeling weird?", "text": "So I would like to apologize in advance if this seems like a massive stream of consciousness thing, because it is.\n\nAnyway, I have been thinking of how I identify lately and attempting to determine where I lie on the trans\\* spectrum. Namely with regards to how I describe myself to others and to myself. You see I am undergoing HRT and my goal is to eventually undergo full genital reconstruction, hair removal except for head, et cetera. That is to say that I desire to, as much as is possible, transition to a place where I would be if I were AFAB as I have found that thus far the limited steps in that direction have made me feel far, far less dysphoric. While I at the same time do not intend to change my clothing style much, or become more stereotypically feminine in my interests. Basically I absolutely adore suits, hiking, and computer science.\n\nIn general I am of the opinion that the purpose of labels is to compress data and that the goal of a good label is to maximize compression while still being accurate and comprehensible to who you are talking to. So from this perspective it would indeed be accurate to describe myself as a woman assuming that definition is of the generally accepted inclusive variety and not one of the more exclusionary definitions supported by transphobes, etc. However, clearly simply having interests that may by cultural gender roles be defined as masculine does not make a person a man, just as feminine interests do not make a person a woman. While stereotypical actions may be gender affirming, I suspect it is very much a culturally related and not related to gender identity. Thus again, clearly by a modern, efficient definition of womanhood I would be a woman.\n\nBut at the same time I do not entirely feel that it is accurate to describe myself as a woman. I feel like I would be in a place where I have no particular reason to be in and would not really fit in. But at the same time I am arguably far further away from men than anything else, even if right now my transition may have been limited. Right now I cannot decide if my identification as non-binary is because I truly am (whatever that means), or it is because I believe being a transwoman would put me in a space of stereotypes that I despise, and thus have come to despise the concept of being a transwoman itself.", "date": "2018-07-02 06:16:42", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8vgf4x/internalized_transphobia_just_plain_feeling_weird/", "author": "404-LOGIC_NOT_FOUND"}, {"title": "My mom just did the \u201cI miss my daughter\u201d thing to me and I managed to not even cry", "text": "I\u2019m proud of myself\u2014 I\u2019m tired of feeling bad about who I am or how I chose to present myself.

So we never had sex.   \n\nSometimes when I read success stories of post-op woman, or seeing their post-op bodies, not only the vagina folds, but also boobs, curvy hips and smooth skin, I am a bit jealous, because I couldn't have those. I am also jealous of those who have female voices. I've tried some \"voice therapy\" to sound more like a girl, so that it feels more real when I want to be a girl. My effort has not been successful. But anyway, I am happy for those transwomen, for they've got what they've been wanting so much. I think in the future if sex-change could be reversible, then I would definitely give it a try.   \n\nFor the rest of the time, I am just a guy. It's like 80&amp;#37; of the time I feel like a guy and 20&amp;#37; of the time I wish I were a girl. I had a girlfriend. When having sex, I was totally OK with being a guy. When I felt like being a girl, we would watch post-op transwoman porn and I would imagine I was the post-op transwoman. It's like they are my proxy, living a fantasy of mine. My ex-gf was fine with it and would sometimes tease me of being a girl. We broke up for other reasons.  \n\nI think that's my story. I used to have another account with a lot of down votes from those mtf people. It turned out that those mtf people didn't think I qualified to be one of them. So I deleted my posts and the account. I don't think I'm gay or bi either.

I'm hoping to get this out of my system, please don't think poorly of me.\n\nFirstly: This person expressed that she was fine with all pronouns and doesn't mind gender-aligned descriptions, so me using female pronouns and calling her a \"girl\" isn't out of disrespect for her identity.\n\nSecondly: I'm not trying to gatekeep or invalidate her. I just really need to get this off my chest.\n\nSo I'm AFAB nonbinary, have been for a long time. But I am not comfortable with being femme at all and I don't really enjoy androgyny. I'm on T and bind, planning on top surgery eventually. I don't use the term demiboy but for a quick explanation that's probably the closest estimation.\n\nAnd one of my friends mentioned in facebook that she was non binary. And I don't want to sound like a gatekeeper but the way she has been handling it makes me very uncomfortable.\n\nShe explained to me that she basically doesn't believe gender exists, it's all social conditioning, and basically invoked the whole \"nothing's real and nothing matters\". She presents exclusively fem and is fine with any and all pronouns, because \"gender is a lie anyway\".\n\nWhich.....idk but I find the \"gender is fake\" stance to be really invalidating towards trans people in general, actually? Like by saying gender isn't real, you're saying that my identity isn't real and transwomen aren't women and etc. etc......it really rubs me the wrong way. My gender is an expensive exhausting pain in my ass I don't want you telling me it's not real.\n\nEDIT: The previous statement is NOT how I'd react to someone who is agender. I'm not offended that an agender person doesn't have a gender, and that fact does not in any way affect my own identity. I AM offended when someone claims to be nonbinary because \"people are idiots and gender isn't real\".]\n\nMeanwhile, I had to unfollow her on facebook because multiple times a day she posts aggressive and accusatory messages about social issues that became too much for me. I have been accused by nearly everyone I know of being too much if an \"SJW\" and even I couldn't stand how viciously this person acts.\n\nSo I'm not trying to make any statements about her, not really. I'm trying to figure out something about myself. Why do I hate her so much? I think it's cause like, my dysphoria can be crippling and my dad stopped talking to me and everytime I interact with someone I'm anxious because I don't really pass as anything right now and I know they'll misgender and I'll be uncomfortable. Meanwhile, she basically just slapped the term on for the sake of perpetuating her social idea that \"gender isn't real\", and it hasn't affected her life at all. Really, I get upset at the idea of us having the same label. Our experiences are so completely different and I feel like she makes me look less valid.\n\nTL;DR: I need to work out my issues with a person I know. I feel like she's using the nonbinary label to push a \"gender doesn't exist\" social agenda and it makes me uncomfortable. I don't want to gatekeep so trust me, I'm not going to invalidate her and if she wants me to start using only certain words and pronouns, I absolutely will.

I am non-binary slightly gender fluid but mostly trans masculine afab.

I absolutely love my birth name Sophia but I cannot stand the constant misgendering. There have been a few days where I\u2019ve genuinely passed as male but as soon as a share my name I\u2019m outed..     \n\nI haven\u2019t decided if I want to legally change my name or not since I am so sentimentally attached to it but I definitely want to at least have a \u201cnickname\u201d I can go by when I want to pass.     \n\nI\u2019m very interested in starting drag so I\u2019ve been thinking of cool drag names as well. If I could find a name that works for both that would be awesome! For example one of my favorite drag kings is Julius Fever, Julius could be used as a regular first name or nickname then adding the last name makes it a drag name. I\u2019m not really expecting to find something that would work like that but it would certainly be a bonus!     \n\nPretty much the only name I\u2019ve seriously considered is the name Eamon (pronounced A-mun). I like it because I\u2019ve never met anyone else named Eamon so I don\u2019t already have an idea of what they look like. It is masculine but I don\u2019t think anyone would question it if I used it on feminine days. I like the way it looks when I write it out (I write E with a backwards 3) and when I sign my initials it looks like a butterfly since my last initial is B. Also don\u2019t judge my priorities but it has wonderful pun potential.    \n\nIt\u2019s a traditional Irish name but I\u2019m worried people will think I made it up and that I will be labeled a \u201csnowflake\u201d more than I already am.  My other concern with it is there isn\u2019t a shorter version I could use as a true nickname. My friends have mentioned people might have difficulty spelling/pronouncing but I honestly couldn\u2019t care less. It\u2019s really not that difficult to spell or pronounce and would take 2 seconds to correct someone.     \n\nI\u2019m not sold on the name Eamon yet and would love some other suggestions!   \n\nTLDR: Transmaculine human needs help picking a name.

I've got FFS scheduled to happen in about 3 months and I *just* got my bottom surgery scheduled for the very beginning of next year.\n\nAnyways, I was going through my wardrobe tonight messing with new outfit combinations and found some of my old \"guy\" clothes that I haven't worn in a while. For whatever reason, I thought \"fuck it\" and threw on a pair of jeans, put on a sports bra to compress my (small) chest, threw on a t-shirt and then tied up my hair under a benie so that it looked short. \n\nWhen I saw myself at first there was an expected wave of dysohoria, I looked almost exactly the same as before I started transitioning (just better groomed and maybe a little prettier). Then, for the hell of it, I grabbed a jean vest that I had lying around and threw it on too. The vest was new, I never used to wear things like it before. This one was something I could never work into my more feminine styles though.\n\nI don't know why or how, but when I saw myself with the vest on, it's like it kinda changed everything. I *really* liked how I looked (though I could feel myself terrified to admit it). Clearly boyish, but with this feminine flair or something. I don't know how to describe it, but it was *different*. I sent a picture to my friend who said I looked \"confident and hot\" and that's honestly how I felt.\n\nI don't know. I definitely didn't feel like a guy/man and I still dont. But wearing the outfit and seeing myself, girl/woman also wasn't quite right. I didn't feel like a butch girl or anything. I know I still want bottom surgery (I hate that part of myself so much...) and I'm *pretty* sure I still want FFS too. But I'm worried now, partly because in order to get the surgeries done I have to present as \" I am 100% woman yup no questions\" and that is maybe not how things are.\n\nSorry for rambling.

I just don't know a whole lot about non-binary but just know that I am different from most people. \n\nA person I am involved with identifies as non binary, and a guy I was dating recently is pre-transition trans. These relationships have caused me to think a lot more about gender and what it all means and the differences between cis and trans. Essentially, I want to know if I feel the same way many people who identify as non binary feel or if I'm cis but just versatile in presentation. \n\nI came out as queer at 15, and that summer I \"came out\" with my preferred choice of clothing. Once I'd realized I like women--I'm a girl--and can wear clothing geared towards guys, I stopped wishing I was a boy and crying that I am not the person I day dream of being (a boy). \n\nI was hardly allowed to wear the clothes I wanted, and so I was often forced to wear clothing geared towards girls. 9x out of 10 I felt very strange and unnatural and awkward in these girls clothes. It didn't feel like it matched how I felt on the inside. It didn't work with my behavior, my body, my movements, my personality. When I presented in a more masculine fashion, it felt right and more me. \n\nEventually, as years went by and I gained freedom and began to understand and embrace myself fully, I stopped feeling so gross and wrong in girls clothes. I could wear what I wanted when I wanted. Sometimes I woke up feeling my masculine self, and would dress accordingly. Sometimes I would wake up feeling feminine and would dress accordingly. \n\nFast forward to now, I'm 25 and there's often no rhyme or reason to what I wear. I can flex back and forth between feminine and masculine fairly easily without feeling strange or uncomfortable or caught in the wrong clothes. I lean towards masculine both in how I feel and in my preference for dress. There are certainly moments where I would feel strange in feminine clothing, but it's not as alien feeling as when I was 15. \n\nOtherwise, I've never had an issue with having female organs for the most part. I have struggled with feeling both masculine and feminine for years, mostly because I sometimes feel lonely when I can't relate to my feminine female friends and because people just generally don't understand me and want to put me in a box. \n\nWhat would you consider this? At 25, I'm not pressed for a new label. I already identify as queer, poly and relationship anarchist lol. But the more I hear and read about non binary experiences, the more I am curious about what I experienced and how related it may be.

(sigh)\n\nBut I made it, and was brought to a room where I was told to take off my top and bra (didn't bother with a binder since it takes me thirty years to remove it), which I had been preparing myself for all week. It's top surgery...someone had to look at my chest at some point.\n\nI was not, however, prepared to be informed that there was a resident shadowing my surgeon, so that would be two men looking at my chest and touching me, but I kept reminding myself that viewing my body from a clinical perspective was waaay different than from a sexual one.\n\nI was prepared to discuss my history and why I wanted top surgery...I was not prepared to be told that as soon as we were done chatting, they'd run the insurance request and schedule a second appointment for right before the surgery. I was referred here by my primary care, but I guess....I don't know, I thought I'd have to fight for it or something, but the general vibe I got was, \"This is happening.\".\n\nI was not prepared to be measured. \n\nI was NOT prepared to be measured.\n\nI kind of just turned my head to the wall and tuned everything out, waiting for it to be over. ((Both men were extremely professional and polite---the surgeon would not even move the folds of my gown away but waited for me to do it ----but regardless....I was not prepared to be measured)\n\nThey took pictures  (sans face), but only after asking if it was okay....I had signed the consent form to take photos and agreed again when they verbally asked but.....I don't know. Our generation has spent way too much time hearing about tech breaches, and having very specific tattoos didn't help me feel confident about my ongoing anonymity.......although, I don't think I could ever be prepared to have pictures taken of my body like that, even though obviously nothing bad had happened.\n\nI cannot emphasize enough how incredibly wonderful my surgeon was....he was so polite, professional, friendly and easy to talk to, appropriate, everything you could ask for in a stranger that got to walk in and see what nobody except your spouse would ever see.\n\nBut then we started talking about the procedure  (the nurse assured me he would go over all the details and answer every single question I had), and I off-handedly laughed when he asked if keeping sensation was important to me, to which I replyed that I'd be fine if he left me with nothing but two scars on my chest. \n\nHe laughed with me and dismissed it at first, but caught something in my response. He gently explained to me that a 100% flat chest is a mastectomy but a male chest is different  (something about the remaining tissue curving a bit to give the definition of muscles or something like that).....and he started asking me quietly (and very gently still), \"Do you want a flat chest or a male chest?\"\n\nAnd he repeated it in the silence as I mentally fought with myself, terrified that if I answered honestly I'd be denied and have my 38D monstrosity forever, and I couldn't risk messing this up when I was so close...\n\nBut I stubbornly repeated that I wanted a flat chest because it was the truth and realizing I didn't even want a male chest left me reeling and confused, which I think he picked up on but didn't say anything disparaging.....and he said I was more than welcome to try and push through for the insurance, but I might have a better case if I had gone through a breast surgeon and requested a cautionary mastectomy due to my medical chart being flagged at a high risk for cancer...\n\nHe assured me that if I did end up going through his office (with or without insurance), he'd be happy to give me the flat chest I wanted, but warned me it was unlikely insurance would cover since I hadn't socially transitioned yet.......but I explained to him that I can't ever fully socially transition without losing far too much, that hormone treatment was highly unlikely, if ever.....and he concluded that perhaps special circumstances could apply, but that it was up in the air.\n\nI left and was prepared to get lost on the drive home (which I did), but wasn't prepared for the jumble of echoing emotions that were ghosting around me. I was stressed but not overtly so, angry but not feeling vindictive, exposed but not taken advantage of, and just a general sense of being overwhelmed even though I wasn't completely sure why. I felt fine and terrible simultaneously.\n\nAll in all, from getting in the car that morning to getting home took a total of four hours, and I more or less haven't stopped shoveling junk food into my mouth since, restlessly moving from one purchase to the next and hoping I can stay distracted. \n\n\nI know I need to sit down and talk this through with myself, figure out what's up.....not being able to freely discuss it with anyone around me has left me frustrated as well.......but my spouse does not support me at all and overtly mocks the whole demographic, so I've just been inwardly feing very overwhelmed and confused, wondering if I've been mistaken about things, or if there's any other factor(s) of which I'm not yet aware......but I guess that's a post for another time. \n\n\n\nTL;DR: Do I even want to be a guy? Is my dysphoria linked to gender issues or something else?

First of all I'd like to thank this community because you helped me a lot when my partner came out as non-binary.\n\nNow I'm the one asking myself questions. I'm an AFAB person who thought of herself as cis up to this point. I kind of had forgotten that I did heavily question my gender for a long time a few years ago - before I knew gender wasn't a binary. I think part of me wanted to be a trans man just so I could know what was up, but I never ever felt like a man. Back then I ended up thinking that not feeling like a man at all qualified me as a woman, enven though now I can't remember if I ever fully felt like one.\n\nThen I sort of brushed it all under the rug, replaced gender angst with a lot of feminist activism, gender studies and the likes... I somehow even forgot how much I had questioned my gender. In the mean time, I was the one who told my trans woman best friend and my non-binary partner that they were, well, trans. So when I started wondering about myself all I could think was \"how could I just find out about myself NOW, after I've helped two people with that?\" It doesn't really make sense but having taken years to come out as bisexual and watching the youtube channel Contrapoints I now think you can be \"woke\" about something and still be in deep denial about yourself.\n\nAnyway. I'm happy when people get confused about my gender, I'm very uncomfortable with performing feminity (I feel better looking androgynous though I enjoy the occasional sun dress), I honestly wonder if cis people even question their gender... On the other hand I have no body dysphoria and no problem with female pronouns.\n\nMore than anything I'm afraid that I've convinced myself I was a woman so deeply that I won't ever know if I really an one? And that I've mixed up the \"gender as an innate sense of identity\" and \"gender as a social construct\" (to me both exist but are very different things, aka gender itself and society-prescribed gender roles) schools of thought too much to be able to know where I'm at.

I'm planning to drop it off later this week (the supreme court debacle has me nervous so I want to get the started ASAP).  Fortunately, the state I live in makes the process very easy: just fill out a very simple petition and drop it off at the courthouse with a check to cover the fees.  However, they have the gender options of \"female\", \"male\", and \"nonbinary\".  All I know for certain is that I'm **not male**.  That has never changed and likely never will change.  But am I truly and properly female?  I'm not really sure.  I used to say I was neuter/agender but that was me trying to avoid the issue of crippling dysphoria.  I built up a full and rich personal identity that doesn't depend on *any* particular gender.  I am a person, first and foremost.  Gender is something else that can be tacked onto that scaffold.  I do have a gender--I can recognize it and admit that now--but all I know is that it's \"not male\".  I think my honest gender identity could be best described as \"femme-lite\".  But that puts me in the female category, doesn't it?  Broadly and loosely, sure.  But that still counts as \"female\", doesn't it?  Doesn't it?  I don't know.\n\nIf there's a big field representing the genders, with one end being \"female\" and the other being \"male\", I stood on the fence running down the middle between the two and took a half-hearted leap towards the female side.  I can see the fields of female identity from where I stand and, one day, I might explore out that way a little bit but probably not right now.  If I look the other way, I see the meadows of male identity and know I'll never step foot over there, not even on pain of death.  My target expression style is femdrogynous/tomboy--I probably won't ever be into dresses and skirts but I'm prescribed estrogen and on the trajectory for GCS.  This sure makes me seem \"female\" but I don't know why It's so hard to commit to that identity.  Is it because I'm still not being honest with myself or because I legit don't feel it's right?\n\nJust typing this out is helping me put things in perspective but I want to make sure I'm not compromising or being dishonest with myself.  A lifetime of dysphoria has taught me how to deny myself and reach for the \"low-hanging fruit\" (compromising, avoiding commitment) rather than what I might want.  But now I don't really know what I want.  Would anyone have any advice or maybe suggest some questions I could ask myself that might help me decide?  What should I look for to figure out whether I'm \"female\" or \"nonbinary\"--at least for the legal record?\n\nThanks everyone!  *HUGS*\n\nEdit: Issue resolved.  I realized I shift between agender and female on a pretty regular basis.  Sliding scale = NB (at least by my standards).

I saw all these messages from feminist groups about all the different kinds of women there are, and thought that my feeling of not fitting in was just me being engrained into a classic model of a woman.. so i still could fit it right? This led to my trying to hyper feminizing my appearance to fit this binary ideal, my boyish body getting in the way of that.

Those people who make you think they support you but they dont. Like for instance my one friend who i first vented to after buying my first binder and how my dysphoria was like fuckin killing me and shit and i fuckin opened up and shit and i croed for like an hour on the phone to her because i just had so much hate for myself and my body and other shit. And i thought she supported me, but i should of fucking knew, the entire time she did ask me questions like \"are you absolutely sure, you might just like the size\" \"wait so you dont wanna be a girl or boy, are yoi sure yoi dont just wanna have smaller boobs?\" \"you really shouldnt spend so much money on a whim\" \"well i guess if youre really committed...\" \n\nAnd when i told another friend, whos fucking great by the way hes the fuckin best, my prefered name she got real pissy and shit and at firsr refused to call me it, and really she doesnt, the only time i am is on her fuckin onsta page or some fuckom shit, and i fuckong should of know or when she saod all those timss \"youre not trans\", \"youre not really nonbinary\" but all those times i excuses her, it was okay because she still \"supported me in spirt\" and all that jazz \n\nBut then we had a 'conversation' which was less of me talking and more of \"her telling me what i really feel\" because apparently \"im just a confused girl who wants a flat chest, and the only reason why is because of the assults, its so sad i was assulted, and of course shes here for me now, but if i had never been assulted i wouldnt 'have dysphoria'and id be a perfectly fine girl\" and i just feel like the worlds biggest fuckin idiot that id believe for even a moment she supported me, for a moment i excused saying shed come around to certain aspects and she did support me. \n\nFor a small moment i thought i had things sorted out with my mom, who was extremely upset when ever i tried to convey to her i didnt want afab. Then we finally sat down and actually talked and i explained i wanted to be neither male or female and she said that she waa okay with that, that she'd still love and accept me. \n\nI sincerely wish she had stopped talking there. She went on to state she was worried id want to get \"the surgery\" on day and how, even though she's \"super progressive and amazing\" and she believes trans people can desire to be the opposite gender, **but** changing your sex is to far, why cant they **keep pretending** to be the opposite gender? (also mom i might not get bottom surgery but I AM getting top surgery on day so youre not out of the field just cause i dont want a dick)I fought the urge to go into full blown argument by reminding myself of the fact she had at least said she was fine with me being nonbinary. \n\nI sincerely wish i didnt \"push it\" with \"my silly questions\" so i asked if shed use my pronouns, but nah shes already got it in grained to her brain and 'it would just feel weird to refer to you as they'. So i then informed her, not asked, that some of my friends already used they pronouns towards me, 'okay, as long as they dont use it around me, i would feel akward', hey since you accept me can i start binding again with out you yelling at me? \"you know how i feel about that, i just said i accepted you, dont push it\", welp how about hair i really wanna fuckim do something about fuckin dysphoria and shits, \"i have told you time and time again, my dad liked girls with long hair so when i was young it was ingrained to me that girls must have long hair\" BUT I JUST SAID I AM NOT A GIRL AND YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED THAT. \n\nbut apparently im a bully, im just trying to bully her into giving me what i want.

I've been lurking here for a few months, I don't post much but try to comment often on all your stunning pictures! \n\n\nTo cut to the chase, I'm an AFAB genderqueer person, and I've recently been heavily considering looking into taking low doses of T to try to feel more at home in my body. I prefer having a more androgynous look, but my face is so round and soft, as well as my body, that I have a very hard time achieving that through clothing and hair. I also go through periods of time where I just *feel* masc, I don't know how to explain it. However, I don't consider myself to be a trans person - just a genderless person who has a lot of traditionally feminine body traits (sans a big chest). My sex drive is even non-existent, which while I *do* identify as asexual, I can't help but wonder if it has to do with hormones and dysphoria.\n\n\nI've been feeling very conflicted about attempting hormone therapy, however. It's not so much introspection on how I personally feel about it as it is ideological self-doubt. Things like, \"There are so many transgender people who desperately want to be on hormone treatment and aren't able to, why should I take it when my dysphoria isn't *that* bad?\" \"Do I really feel this way about myself, or am I trying to be \"T  R  E  N  D  Y?\"\" \n\n\nI know some of this doubt is rooted in discussions in the LGBTQ community from less inclusive members, and some is internalized from my mother, who keeps insisting that she \"had a beautiful daughter and she doesn't make mistakes.\"\n\n\nHow do you all personally feel about hormone therapy without transitioning? And do any of you fine folks who have or are undergoing it have any advice for me?

Earlier this year, I came out to my life partner who is my wife and the mother of my daughter.\n\nI told you about how hard it was for her to accept.  Some of you suggested to me that my wife is a bigot and I might be best off separated from her.  I believe and have faith that she loves me, but she's used to thinking of me as a man that I presented myself as, not some odd trans-non-binary something or another.  It is truly unfair to her that she married me presenting as what I thought I needed to present as instead of how I feel inside.  As a matter of fact, I denied to myself who and what I am.\n\nI do not believe that my wife is a bigot.  I believe that she feels a bit cheated that she didn't get what she thought she was getting.  Time has healed some of the shock from the coming out, but there is more work to do.  She has reassured me that she loves me.  After all, regardless of whatever else I am, I am her loyal husband and the devoted father of our daughter.  She admires me for filling these roles even if my gender identity makes her uncomfortable.\n\nMy father, on the other hand, is a bigot.  I don't believe I will ever choose to be \"out\" to him in any sense of the word.  It is quite possible that I will eventually be outed to him, and that is something I dread.  On the other hand, keeping my gender identity a secret from him seems like a heavy burden to bear.  My father is a man who openly hates LGBT people, and the idea that I could be one disgusts him.  I honestly believe that if were to explain to him that I am trans-non-binary, he would likely insinuate that I chose to become something totally disgusting because I hate him and want to hurt him.  His head would explode. (and it would be my fault, at least in his mind)\n\nAs for my wife, in spite of her assurances that she loves me, which I do take at face value, it is clear to me that there is a long road ahead.\n\nI love my wife very much.  She is a very devoted wife and she doesn't deserve to have to undertake a difficult personal journey to learn to love her husband as he truly is as opposed to as she wishes he were.  I want to make her happy, but I see her longing for me to be something that I am not, and honestly, it breaks my heart because I believe she deserves to be happy.  We deserve to be happy together.  We've never done anything wrong to hurt anyone.  We just want to enjoy our life together and raise our little daughter to grow into a wonderful person.\n\nI hate to admit it, but it's still difficult for me to love this non-binary part of myself.  As I said in the past, I was taught growing up that transgender people are so disgusting as to be practically beyond words to properly describe how disgusting they are.  I know it's a cliche, but my heart is full of love and I feel disgusted that I had this bigotry drilled into my head.\n\nBut back to my wife... she's been saying things lately... It's almost like a passive-aggressive resistance to my gender identity, and it betrays her anxious longing for me to go back into the closet and stay there forever!  Friends, I can't do that.  I don't want to martyr myself for her sake.\n\nThe only way that I've seriously thought about permanently modifying my body is I've thought about having my facial hair removed.  I haven't grown a beard in years.  I visited a few places that provide that service and did research about it, and I eventually told my wife, and she wistfully said, \"Oh, but I like your facial hair\", referring to the stubble that I've come to see like a blemish on my skin as a result of gender dysphoria.  I've mentioned it numerous times, and the response is always the same.  It's like I'm threatening to take a favorite toy away from a child.  How could I do that?\n\nI've been growing my hair out a bit.  It's still only several inches long.  For those of you who don't know, the average person's hair grows at a rate of about six inches per year, so if I want a head of hair reaching down to my shoulders, that will take \\*years\\*.  And yet, it's only been several months since I stopped regularly cutting it short, and she's already making remarks about how \"handsome\" I look with short hair.  Just a few hours ago, she pointed to a picture on the wall taken on our wedding day, telling me how handsome I am with short hair.  Friends, she wants to be married to a man, not an enby.\n\nThat doesn't even begin to cover how she feels about my mannerisms.\n\nHonestly, if my wife were to decide that she doesn't like me the way I am, there are very few people out there who seem to like me as I am.  I am an introvert, not a socialite, and most of my friends are \"pen friends\" and \"internet friends\".\n\nI believe then, that the two of us are at a point where she needs to understand that I am an enby and that I never will be (and never truly was) the man she wants me to be.  It is unfair to her that I presented myself to her as something I'm not, and it is unfair to me that I'm facing pressure to be something that I'm not.\n\nI just don't know how to talk to her about it.\n\nThe only thing I know to do is to have a very frank talk about it.  Tell her \"This is what I am and I am powerless to change that.\" and \"I love you, but you are pressuring me to something that I'm not and it's hurting me, so I need you to stop.\" and perhaps, \"Darling, this is what I am and I know it's not what you want, so can you help me understand how I can make it easier for you because you deserve to be happy.\"\n\nMaybe I do know what needs to be said after all.", "date": "2018-07-13 04:47:15", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8yh1i3/the_long_journey_to_have_this_part_of_me_accepted/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "So in Ontario, you can opt for your Drivers License or Photo ID to have your gender marker changed to X", "text": "I went to my local Ontario Service place and managed to change my gender marker on my License to X.

Ah this post is so hard to write. I already tried and deleted it. Anyway. \n\nI\u2019m AFAB. (I almost just deleted this post again because this is hard to say and I\u2019m not sure what to say and ahhh) However I feel like I\u2019m nothing I guess? I\u2019m uncomfortable with the assumptions brought along with gender. I feel best being referred to as they/them, and my chosen name (though I haven\u2019t been able to ask anybody to do this yet). \nI don\u2019t know if this general sense of unease is dysphoria, and I have this weird bottom dysphoria that comes out when I think about intercourse with women (I\u2019m bisexual) in which I wish I had male genitalia/ male genitalia feels right at the time. I have no desire or feelings regarding my genitals otherwise. I wish my chest was flat, but I think this is maybe just a preference thing to do with my general unhappiness with my body. \n\nSpiritually, I feel like people are just people. While I understand that physical sex exists, I don\u2019t think this should be of note or affect one\u2019s view of the individual. I guess I see the soul and not the physical form, so gender expression is more just personal expression in my eyes. People should just be accepted for who they are at the base level, without uncontrollable factors being taken into account. However I\u2019ll always respect other\u2019s pronouns, and understand the importance of using proper pronouns in regards to one\u2019s well being. I take the way someone identifies as the truth. \n\nA lot of my hobbies are softer and \u201cgirly\u201d, so that\u2019s why I guess I \u201cdoubt\u201d myself the most. However, logically I find this ridiculous because interests are genderless and perceived gendering is a condition of society. I also seem to put more weight on my traditionally feminine hobbies when questioning my gender, where as I\u2019m quick to push aside my traditionally masculine hobbies as not meaningful enough in this context. Again, illogical. \n\nI just feel like a being of nothingness. Just a being that doesn\u2019t desire or align with the visual, physical world. However I don\u2019t really present androgynously, because I don\u2019t put weight into physical appearance determining gender and many of my interests fall into the cutesy/ pastel category. I would find it fine and not at all \u201cfeminine\u201d of a man to participate in cutesy or pastel things, so I\u2019m not sure why I feel so negatively towards myself about this stuff.\n\nI guess I\u2019ll end this here because I\u2019m genuinely just rambling.\n\ntl;dr : \nGender identity primarily feels spiritual with minimal genital dysphoria, \u201cgirly\u201d interests make me doubt myself despite my \u201cmasculine\u201d hobbies, gender neutral pronouns/chosen name make me feel best. I don\u2019t feel \u201cnonbinary\u201d enough I guess, or I feel as though it\u2019s coming from an odd place.\n\n", "date": "2018-07-13 19:11:59", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8ymukx/possibly_nonbinary_looking_for_guidance/", "author": "jellyfishtoss"}, {"title": "Changing name w/CA DMV: anyone used the \"DMV Now\" electronic kiosks?", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-13 23:16:49", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8yorft/changing_name_wca_dmv_anyone_used_the_dmv_now/", "author": "freeingmason"}, {"title": "Bottom growth on nonbinary people?", "text": "Hi ,im an ftx nonbinary person and would like to start testosterone pretty soon the only thing that makes me hesitant on doing so is bottom growth i know i cant pick what i want from  testosterone but i would like to know how much does it grow every month (couldnt find many updates/researches for some reason??)

I just needed to get it all out...\n\n**TL;DR - my partner of 5 years said he felt pretty ambiguous about his own gender and gender in general, told me he would support me however he could. I had told him that I loved androgynous/masculine styles but had always been scared to look more androgynous for fear of threatening what little identity as a woman that I had (my only link to my gender identity was 'I have a female body and female features, I must be a girl')... but I felt maybe I could relax about this now. He immediately took me on a shopping trip and started picking out men's clothes for me. As we both look pretty obviously cis, we mildly bamboozled a changeroom attendant. It was awesome.**\n\nWhen I began to talk, he asked if he could stop me for a second, and told me he loved me and supported me and would use whatever pronouns I needed. If surgery was going to be a thing, he would do his absolute best to support me but, as we had discussed in a random hypothetical discussion ages ago, the romantic aspect of the relationship would be up in the air til we got to know each other with the new gender again.\n\nI was expecting the second, even though I don't really think I want or need surgery, but the first part was a relief to hear.\n\nPart of my explanation to him was about why I had initially tried to tell him how I felt via one external category: mens' fashion. \n\nDespite really liking men's fashion and androgyny, I was scared to wear it because it threatened my identity as a woman. At the time I thought it was my sexual identity, and that if I went 'butch' it would mean that I would only like women. But when I stopped to think about it, I realised that that was actually really silly--the identity it was threatening was my gender. \n\nDressing in shapeless clothing or men's clothing for comfort was one thing--it was utility only and I wore it whenever I didn't have to go out. Since I based my identity on my appearance, any serious attempt to conceal my gender and/or make me look deliberately androgynous or masculine in a really stylised way would mean I was taking gendered-clothing seriously on an appearance-based level. This would pose a huge, *huge* threat to my gender identity, as its one tenuous link to the rest of my identity would be cut out.\n\n**\nWhen he finally got it, he had the biggest eureka look on his face that I have ever seen on anyone, and told me he'd been in the same position a few years ago--when he was my age. But he resolved it not by finding a non-binary label but defining himself only by himself--eg \"I am [his name]\". He does this with everything so I had a bit of an 'oh duh, of course' moment. Classic him.\n\nAnyway, he told me he loved me again and suggested that we get out of the house to have a bit of an emotional break.\n \nWe went to Target just for something to do, and he suggested we go have a look around. When I started by looking at the stuff closest to the door, which was the womens' section, he said, \"How about we go straight to the mens' section and get you a shirt?\"\n\nI was a little apprehensive out of habit, but still  wanted to do it. Halfway there, he got distracted and started talking about cargo pants, because \"You know I've always thought cargo pants would look good on you.\"\n\nShirt forgotten, when we got to the mens section, he made this adorably huge fuss over choosing the right cut and colour. Here are some quotes from him:\n\n\"No, those aren't cargo pants, we want cargo pants.\"\n\n\"I really wish this one was lighter, like that pair over there, but those aren't cargo pants unfortunately.\"\n\n\"You told me you're trying to get away from wearing black, so how about another colour?\"\n\n\"Yeah, I agree, I like the green better than the tan, too.\"\n\n\"If we're going to do this menswear thing, it's going to be done right!\"\n\nThis is what shopping with him is like every time, even in the womens' section (sadly, he's better at my clothes than I am). This time, I was especially glad he took the lead as I might have lost my nerve.  And he was just there, supporting me. In text he might sound a bit overbearing, but our relationship is such that as soon as I tell him I need some space or want to do my own thing, he backs off.\n\nOnce we were there, he couldn't wait to see what I'd look like. When I came out, he told me how great he thought they looked (they did look pretty great), and had all these different suggestions for how I could wear them and what to style them with.\n\nThere wasn't any particular special moment for me as I tried on the pants, cause, well, they were just pants. If and when I ever suit up fully maybe Ill feel like that.\n\nI think we really bemused the changing room attendant, because we were to all appearances a hetero romantic couple... but the girl in the scenario was trying on guy's clothes and the guy had clearly chosen them for her and was offering pretty sophisticated opinions on fit and style. She was really polite and friendly and chatty, but you could practically see the wheels turning in her head as she tried to figure out what was going on.\n\nTo be honest, that whole experience in the changeroom, of just being myself and enjoying something 'odd' while being with my partner, who was uber supportive and just being himself too, was the highlight of the whole trip. Plus I do enjoy making other peoples' lives a little more surreal.\n\nWhen we came out of the fitting room, he said \"Okay, so you know how they look on you--would you like them? Cause I'm happy to buy them for you.\"\n\nI hemmed and hawwed, because we're both broke as shit and I hadn't intended for the try-on session to be more than, well, trying things on. But he insisted he could afford it, and he is slightly less broke than me, so I gave in. And now I have really comfy, durable cargo pants and a boyfriend who loves me and has made it very clear that he still wants to bump uglies.\n\nIt does not even seem real. Like, we've been together for a long time but this is just plain unrealistic. Then again, he's unlike anyone else I've ever met.\n\nIf you actually read all this, wow and thank you. I kind of needed to just share this story somewhere even if nobody does read it. It still kind of makes me want to cry happy tears.\n\nedited to take out some length where I could and add a tldr.", "date": "2018-07-14 08:37:40", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8yrwj9/i_afab_told_my_amab_partner_i_think_i_might_be_nb/", "author": "EvenTangerine"}, {"title": "It's International Nonbinary Day today, July 14th!

I'm FtX, 22, NY based. \n\nI realized I wasn't cis a few years back. At that time, I thought I was gender fluid, and wanted to start T more than anything. Experienced dysphoria almost daily. Now I consider myself just genderless/something else, but I still think I want to start T. The problem is that before, I was with a partner who wouldn't have accepted it. Due to that, I just learned to ignore how I felt and buried it. A few years later, my now fiancee and I have talked it over and we agree that if I start it will be a process to get used to, but it's something we will work on together and he won't leave me because of it. He supports me 100%. \n\nNow, I'm just sort of feeling lost, because for the longest time I felt stuck with the way I am now. I'm very feminine looking, and I feared that my partners would leave if I looked more masculine. But now that it's a complete possiblity that I could start, I don't know what to really make of it.\n\nWhat if I regret it? What if my fiancee starts to not be attracted to me because I look more masculine? \n\nWith that being said, I am actually relatively comfortable with how I look. I want to lose some weight however, and I have heavy bouts of jealousy(?), envy(?) when I see other \"masculine\" looking people, ESPECIALLY andro people. I also feel that this apathy is just a result of my foolishness in putting someone elses desires before my own. Even if my fiancee isn't attracted to me if I start T, I could still make it on my own. He's been the only constant in my life, however, and losing his security would be devastating for a while. But I could make it. I love myself enough to do what I need to do to be happy, but I'm just worried about the potential fallout of starting To and finding out it isn't for me after all.\n\nI dunno.

However, according to everyone around me, my gender fluctuations (between binary masc and binary femme, nearly no middle ground, and the brief periods of time I am both I am at my most dysphoric) have been happening and obvious to anyone who knows me at all at least since I was a teenager in the 1980s. When I came out to two people I hadn't seen since about 1989, the response was \"yep, that makes sense.\" My adult kids also said, \"Yeah, mom, we've always known you were more than *just* female.\"\n\nIt was actually easier before I knew/understood what/who I am. I had mild dysphoria when I was on a guy swing, which has mostly disappeared since I now acknowledge my guy side, chosen a name, and present as male part time while on guy swings. But I was always very happy and comfortable on girl swings, though they weren't as *complete* as they are now.\n\nThere are times when I love being bi-gender, and I kind-of feel sorry for cisgender people who have never had the experience of *being* the other gender. I love *being* a guy, in a completely different way than the way I love being a girl. When I'm fully guy I'm totally relaxed, chill, comfortable, but at the same time thrilled and excited to be there. When I'm fully girl I feel powerful, intense, happy/bubbly and happy to be me.\n\nHowever, now that I'm completely conscious of what's happening, I just want it to stop. I would prefer to be fully cis female. As a girl I'm totally femme, I feel like a cis girl, I am disinterested anything associated with guys, I don't even like unisex shirts. I won't ride a men's bike! I begin to doubt I have a masc side, and that it's all in my head. However, the next best thing would to be fully binary masc - just be completely FTM, and make a full transition to be happy. When I'm on a guy swing I start to doubt my femme identity, and I really feel fully male/transguy.\n\nAs it is I'm stuck going back and forth and it's getting really old, really fast. Sometimes it's worse than the dysphoria I had when I was an egg. When I didn't know what was happening I was like, okay, this is just the way I am, but I'm a girl, just a confused, weird girl. Now I am constantly dealing with my partial transition, maintaining two wardrobes, balancing two gender identities, and I'm getting to the point where I don't know who I am anymore, even at the same time I understand myself better than ever before.\n\nI'm on T (13 months) and loving most of the changes - when I'm totally on a guy swing. My worst dysphoria is physical - presence of breasts (when I'm on a guy swing) and lack of a penis (all the time). This dysphoria has been there since I was 12, but I never knew *why* until recently. But I have to moderate the changes I allow myself. I have to maintain enough guy when I'm on a girl swing, so that when I swing back I don't get an attack of dysphoria, and the reverse, as a guy I have to maintain something of being a girl so that I don't freak out when I swing back to girl.\n\nIf I could burn one of them out of me forever, I would do it in a heartbeat.", "date": "2018-07-17 18:01:54", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8zngf2/question_for_those_with_fluctuating_genders/", "author": "CailanJade"}, {"title": "Still get called ma'am, she, miss and I have to swallow my sadness!", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-17 18:26:07", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/8znoju/still_get_called_maam_she_miss_and_i_have_to/", "author": "Bayylien"}, {"title": "I now know what dysphoria feels like", "text": "Here's some background: I'm AFAB and non-binary, I am also a parent who breastfeeds.

We've always been friends first and foremost throughout our 15 years together and we value trust and honestly very highly in our relationship.\n\nWe spent the whole night going from crying and talking, with him saying some pretty upsetting things as he worked it out in his head, to not talking for hours so he could process/research and then he left to go drive and clear his head for like an hour, and he came back and was SO supportive and loving. I couldn't have asked for a better result, honestly. He's terrified this means I won't want to be with him, which is NOT the case. It's a gender identity thing, not a sexual orientation thing. He wants me to focus on figuring out what this means for me, and then we'll see what that means for our relationship. \n\nWhat's ultimately scary for both of us is if I come to the conclusion that I'm transmale (which I told him is a door I'm not closing as of yet), he might not be able to stay in a relationship with me if I go a certain way in terms of how I present (e.g. going on T or having top surgery).

S has been wearing a binder for a couple of years now, and has wanted top surgery for even longer. The physical repercussions of wearing a binder, as well as the fact that their chest is very large (to the point where even if there wasn't chest-related dysphoria, S would probably need a reduction) are really taking a toll. BUT when it comes to taking concrete action towards getting the surgery (scheduling consultations, etc.) S seems to just freeze up. Their main reason is not wanting take time off work to see doctors (and also not wanting to explain what the surgery is to bosses). I think I might understand the delay better if I didn't see the constant physical and emotional pain this situation has caused them for the past several years.\n\nI want S to be happy, and I know that top surgery will be a huge help. Right now I'm struggling with being supportive without feeling like I'm being paternalistic / doing the thing for them.

When I was younger, even though my mum cut my hair into a bob every time, I got taken for a boy by countless strangers. And it didn't perturb me - I actually enjoyed that fact. One of my early memories is of when my mum put my hair in plaits when it was wet (I think I was reluctant) so it would go wavy once dry. When I saw the result, I cried. It was horrible. I looked like a *girl.*\n\nI remember looking in the mirror and holding my hair back, imagining myself as a boy. I thought I might make a good one. But how embarrassing would that be? It's impossible. And I'm so short.\n\nSecondary school was a bit more difficult, due to the oft-cried phrase, \"is that a boy or a girl?\"... well, obviously it was embarrassing. When people ask me, I don't know how to answer. Partly because it feels like a jibe, but partly because I don't want to answer. Often I say I'm \"whatever\". When people ask my pronouns, I'm just like..  \"use what you want dude\".\n\nEven now I get taken for a boy. I'm not sure if this makes me uncomfortable solely because they must also assume I am 15 at most, or just because that's not how I identify, or just because I'm embarrassed for them! I know that I've internalised a lot of transphobia/homophobia from my dad, and that I don't want to come out as anything just because of what he might say, how he might taunt me, that kind of thing. I also know that I want to present sort of masculine, and have always resented the arse that my dad made clear that I had. (nothing sexual there, just inappropriate jokes/comments)\n\nMostly I just feel like a person, and definitely don't want to be taken for a girl. Being called \"girl\", \"lady\", any of that crap, makes my intestines tighten. Being looked upon by a male partner as a girl makes me uncomfortable. Thinking about it, this is probably why sex has been kind of a problem.\n\nRecently I was thinking along the lines of \"right well though I feel sort of agender I'm going to keep my pronouns as she/her because otherwise I'm giving in to gender norms\".. but I'm starting to realise that part of gender identity is to do with how you want people to treat you. I'm starting to realise what social dysphoria actually is, and that it exists, and that I have it. I always thought the only dysphoria was physical dysporia and being misgendered. And also, I may have physical dysphoria. I'm never sure what to think of my breasts. Fortunatlely they're small. I never wear dresses or skirts - because I hate how they make me feel.

Saw a psychiatrist a couple years ago for help with PTSD. She was all on board and super cooperative right up until I mentioned that I'm pansexual and nonbinary. The conversation immediately became \"well you clearly can't make up your mind about anything. You clearly have an identity disorder\". I was immediately shut down and told to come back for tests (I didn't and surprise! I show no signs of BPD which she told me was my diagnosis despite not having run the test yet.)\n\nCut to today, I had an appointment with my GP to talk about the results of my bloodwork and to talk about methods of taking my hormone of choice. Instead, he said he recieved my file and had a couple more questions about something he saw before he can start me on hormones. Turns out this psychiatrist put \"Patient has identity/personality issues, questionable PTSD but unlikely\".\n\nLuckily my GP is more willing to listen, and we talked about treatment specifically for PTSD because he believes that that's a more likely diagnosis after talking a bit about the circumstances that lead me to that. I left with information about starting medication to finally get my PTSD under control - which dont get me wrong I'm SO HAPPY someone was finally willing to listen and I'm gonna get something dealt with that should have been a long time ago.\n\nThe problem is more so that my doctor wants to put off prescribing me hormones until we talk about mental health more. Which wasn't going to be the case if I didnt get flagged by a transphobic/queerphobic psychiatrist. It also takes about a month to get in with my GP in the first place, and this is the second appointment with him to talk about gender/hormones/mental health. He told me that he's not saying no or even maybe and that he acknowledges hormones are right for me.\n\nI just can't help but feel like this psychiatrist I saw once YEARS ago is still hindering my ability to finally transition. I know I'll get hormones eventually, but instead of starting this month like I was on track to, it's being delayed AGAIN by at least another two months.

(long post sorry in advance, will put tldr)", "text": "Hey everyone! \nI've been thinking of posting something like this on various social media/support groups but I'm worried about how it will be received. You all seem lovely in the responses I have read from the archived posts, so thanks in advance for any and all responses!\n\nI read another post about a month ago regarding this topic (forestmango 's post) but it didn't answer all of my questions so I hope it's okay if I post this here?\n\nI'm a cis(?) woman currently questioning my gender.\n\nIt has a lot to do with not understanding/feeling alienated from womanhood/femininity in one breath (and being okay with that, having the freedom of being andro-presenting, rejected girly things/never liked them in the first place) but also I feel ashamed because I am not \"feminine enough\" for my current gender.\n\nBeing currently identified as an adult woman, I feel constantly pressured to present fem all the time and to conform to the gender binary. I never did when I was a kid- but it's nice to look nice and get complimented for your efforts. (It takes so much energy out of me to present fem when I'm not feeling fem) But I'm not sure if that's because they think I look nice, or they like the fact that I'm presenting \"correctly\" to my assigned gender.\n\nI have no idea what it means to be a woman (take away the female biology) truly but I really want to know. It's so hard for me to grasp. I feel like Ariel wanting to be a part of the 'pretty fem world' but never feeling welcome unless I bring the correct dress code and even then- I still feel left of center in women's spaces. It's a weird disconnect/connect situation that I haven't quite figured out yet. \n\n(I was thinking of opening a conversation with some of my trans-fem friends and ask how they would describe womanhood and how they feel it, but I'm not sure if that's a shitty question that I shouldn't ask.)\n\nSome days I can really feel the fem energy very strongly but most days I just feel like a person and I want to be treated as such. I've come to terms with I might be genderqueer/genderfluid moreso than non-binary or cis but I don't want to take away from people who are really aligned with those labels. \n\nWhenever I look at my own face and it doesn't align with what I have in my head I can't recognize myself and I feel so sad that I can't just be the way I want to look, or accept myself as is.\n\nI also feel a strong desire to express my truth (through music, I'm a musician in a lot of women//trans//GNC empowered spaces) -that you don't have to be feminine/fem presenting to be a valid woman. But how can I do that if I don't even believe it in myself? I want to be confident that you can be andro/masc + a woman, or feminine and Non-Binary but I haven't accepted myself as either of those when I know I should.\n\nI don't want to invade any spaces or take any resources I'm just really lost and uncomfortable in my own skin.\n\nI can't tell if I'm having trouble being myself (A GNC fem/andro cis woman) and accepting that that is okay!\nOR\nActually a Non-binary person who feels different energies and has/wants a strong connection to womanhood and the women around me.\n\nI'm so sorry if this came off as very rambly. My non-binary friend that I spoke to last year (amab) said that the feelings I have would still make me cis and I believe them to a degree but I still feel as if something is off.\n\nI've been trying out She/her and they/them pronouns recently and it feels really nice! Rebecca Sugar one of my favorite creators just came out as a Non-Binary woman and that made me feel really at ease to know someone else might get it! But if I'm not Non-Binary, I don't want to incorrectly use the label.\n\nThanks again for reading this whole dang thing, I've been feeling very restless about this for so long. Part of me knows you can be an andro woman and be valid, but that doesn't feel quite right. Everything that comes with womanhood and femininity sucks in this world because it's perceived as \"lesser\" so that might add to it? Maybe some internalized misogyny in there? If anyone can relate or offer some advice, I'm open to any and all comments even if they are negative. Thanks again &lt;3\n\n\nTLDR: I (Cis? woman) am questioning my gender.

I've never had an enby as a friend in person.  TBH, most people would have no idea that I feel like an enby because I live with such enormous pressure to conform.  My wife and I have come to an agreement that \"boundaries\" shall consist of me dressing and presenting masculinely when we go out together, but I can do as I please around the house.  (She says she is afraid that someone might do something to us.)\n\nSo... around the house, I wear a dress from time to time, and at first, it's like, \"Oh cool!  I can wear different clothes and see how they feel\", but after a bit, it's like, \"Okay, I'm wearing a dress.  Whatever...\"\n\nTrying to learn to express myself as an enby means far more to me than just wearing a dress or changing my hairstyle.\n\n**The first time I felt a trifle of gender euphoria about not being cismale** was when my wife used to tease me by playfully insinuating that I am gay.  (I am strictly gynoromantic.)  Whenever she did this, I would smile and put on some excessively feminine body language and saying something like \"Oh really, Dear?  You think that I am gay?  I want to hear all about it, Sweetheart!\" and we would both laugh, and **I really enjoyed it**.\n\nWhen I actually have a serious conversation and came out as trans-enby, this fun came to a screeching halt.

I hope you're doing well. Not sure how to properly ease into this so I'm just going to dive in. I'm a somewhat closeted transmasculine non binary person. I currently live in Asia for work and present as my cis gender to make life easier for myself socially essentially. Unfortunately I plan on living in Asia for about seven more years into the future to achieve some personal life goals of mine before returning to the states where I can probably transition medically via HRT to reach a more androgynous place in presentation and potentially in mindset as well. Anyway, I would describe myself as an effeminate (trans)man. I find androgyny to be the ultimate beauty ideal and find myself drawn to androgynous people. I feel like carving a life out in society as a non binary person though can be quite difficult and confusing at times. If someone is sure of their gender, that is if they identify as a binary gender such as male or female, that will reflect in their official documents, etc, but for those of us who don't identify as a binary gender neither of them feel completely right. This is the case for me anyway. I can manage living with the gender I was assigned at birth because I enjoy effeminate things. The rest I'll have to live with and stave off dysphoria with positivity and hope for the future. As much as I want to become androgynous at times there are moments for example when I'm wearing a skirt presenting as female (as usual) and I think about the future, and transitioning and if I appear male to people having to present as male to be socially accepted and that meaning I'd likely have to wear pants or shorts and then feeling a kind of sadness over the loss of being able to openly wear skirts without fear if I have more of a masculine form. I feel like approaching androgyny from the binary female side seems easier than the binary masculine side, in that femininity has more flexibility and freedom than masculinity, at least in American society. In Asia, ironically, in comparison to America, it seems more fluid and free. Men where I live would likely be considered metrosexual in America. Anyway, back to the point. Neither male or female feels right on official documents, so which do I chose? That's difficult. Dating as a non binary person or trans person seems relatively difficult as well and is honestly another part of the reason I suppress my trans identity at times, because navigating the dating world as a cis person (correct term?) is so much easier and the dating pool seems so much larger. That's such a discouraging thing about being trans, the inevitable rejection due to your plumbing situation, which as a transman you have little control over because none of the options, at least to me, end in satisfying results. Anyway (sorry I'm all over the place I have ADHD) I also think about getting married and having kids some day. I worry about raising kids as a non binary or trans person, though our generation seems more open to such things. I also have no idea what I would wear at my wedding. A dress? A suit? And then when it comes to kids I know I'd want to get pregnant and give birth to them myself, so if I do hormones I have to consider the effects of them on my body and have to go off of them in order to have kids. It's all so complicated. I just wanted a space to vent and wondered if there were any other people out there thinking about these kinds of things.

Confused.", "text": "This is going to be a bit of a rant, sorry.\n\nI call myself a non-binary trans girl, for convenience's sake and a way of saying \u201cnot binary, not a guy\u201d. But I don't know if that label really fits me. What\u2019s actually happening is that I\u2019m in flux between \"girl\" and \"none pizza\", with a lack of gender winning out most of the time. I'm considering laser (I hate having facial hair) and other ways to look more androgynous, but I can probably never \u201ctransition\u201d in the sense of hormones or surgery. Mentally, I'm squicked by the idea of growing breasts; it doesn\u2019t seem to fit my internal body map. And then, this gets stirred together with a general dislike of having my body sexualized and looked at in an objectifying way. I feel like I'm dealing with some DFAB trans issues in a DMAB body, and it confuses the hell out of me. I know agender DMAB folks are out there, and I know the term demigirl exists for those of us who still feel a connection to the \u201cgirl\u201d category, but I still feel like a fake in most trans and even non-binary spaces.\n\nPart of me worries that I\u2019m appropriating an experience that isn\u2019t mine, and that I just want the social benefits of being a girl without any of the social or physical drawbacks. I feel like female-read people are more trusted by others, less likely to come off as creepy when they joke or flirt, have more freedom to act in ways atypical of their gender, and have closer and more intimate friendships. I\u2019m also horribly touch-starved, which feeds into this.\n\nBut then I look at transfeminine spaces, and a lot of the things they list as positives \u2014 yay boobs! yay skirts! \u2014 don\u2019t read as positive at all to me. I feel stuck because I can\u2019t perform gender in a way that both feels good to me and is understood by others. Masculinity is the default for gender, the standard, and femininity is difference and deviation. So anything society views as less gendered is automatically read as male. Fr\u2019ex, I like wearing my hair short, but in other people\u2019s eyes, that doesn\u2019t signify anything other than male. At best, I\u2019m read as a twink, never a tomboy.\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m in my mid-thirties, very slightly built, and have been very thin all my life regardless of what or how much I eat. I look about half my physical age, which I kind of like, but I don\u2019t like talking about it or revealing my real age to people who don\u2019t know me well.\n\nI'm slightly romantically and sexually interested in women, but I don't really consider myself a lesbian, or straight for that matter. Just a person who might maybe have a partner someday, but honestly isn't in a rush to start anything.\n\nSo... demi-ace, demigirl, and agenderflux? I don't know.

I don't want to judge, but I just thought about my body and felt fortunate that I feel that my body is less overtly male than some of the other male bodies I've seen.  I've been experiencing a lot of anxiety lately, and it helped me feel a sense of gratitude for the body I have.  I feel very fortunate that I can be something of an endurance athlete without growing huge muscles to make me feel dysphoric.\n\nI'd like to grow my hair out a bit and have my facial hair removed.  When I wear a dress, I usually wear something modest with long sleeves and leggings or tights underneath.  I'm gynoromantic and I don't want to attract sexual overtures from other guys. ;-)  But then again, I'm presenting strictly masculine outside the house for the time being.\n\nI just want to say that in spite of all my posts detailing my struggles, I'm feeling more hopeful and less anxious today and I'd like to offer to share my positive vibes with everyone else.", "date": "2018-07-30 02:14:51", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9306th/feeling_better_about_my_body_today/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "Sometimes growing hurts so bad", "text": "This is just my theme for lately.

For the past 15 years since I've internalised that \"rule\" and have done everything I could to live up to that cute boy's standard of beauty. When the push up bras didn't do enough, and when my chronic digestive issues caused bloating, I would be left with shame and disgust towards this sad sack of flab I've been destined to live inside. I hid inside hoodies and one piece swimsuits when I really wanted was a belly button piercing and a bikini with board shorts. \n\nI came to the realization that I was nonbinary in December 2017, and started my transition with testosterone injections in May. I wanted to get as far away from womanhood as possible without becoming a man and inheriting all the rules and codes that go with that side of the gender spectrum. I want to just be me. Cute and sweet, but gross and strong as hell. Nails painted one day, building my own furniture the next. Buzzed hair, no makeup, wearing a binder...under a dress. Because fuck the rules. I've wasted likely half my life being a weird girl not knowing I was actually something else entirely.\n\nSince I've started testosterone, my inner self is starting to become my outer self as well. My voice, my muscles, and my genitals are all becoming what I've wanted them to be. I'm also starting to notice a good amount of fat redistribution, with it leaving my boobs and butt and finding a new home on my stomach. And thanks to my healthy intake of alcohol, pickle flavored chips, and gummy peach rings, I've started to develop the beginnings of a nice beer belly. But despite it being what I've fought against since high school, I'm not upset about my tummy being bigger then my boobs. I'm actually pretty proud of it, and I can't figure out why. What I do know is that this is the first time in my life I've looked down there and not felt disgusted about the squishy blob I've found. I fully plan on wearing whatever the hell I want from now on, regardless of the proportions of the lumps on my torso. And hell, maybe I'll even go get that belly button ring.\n\n", "date": "2018-07-30 04:47:57", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9315mf/body_image_issues_improving_after_coming_out_to/", "author": "neverforgetyourtowel"}, {"title": "I Think the Plants Are Enby Too!", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-30 05:48:57", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/931i5y/i_think_the_plants_are_enby_too/", "author": "Summerspeaker"}, {"title": "Definitely 'not a bakery'", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-30 13:36:05", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9343zy/definitely_not_a_bakery/", "author": "goddess_ofthe_stars"}, {"title": "I'm pretty sure I'm non-binary, but not sure I need to come out or even personally identify as such?", "text": "I've always known I lack a strong gender identity, feel pretty much as if I'm agender and I very much present as androgynous, but I've never put all that much thought into my gender identity.

Apologies in advance if none of this makes sense. :/ \n\nSo I've pretty much lived my whole life identifying as female; when I was a kid, though, I would idolize male characters in tv shows and movies. I proudly called myself a tomboy and vehemently rejected anything I deemed \"girly,\" sometimes even wishing I'd been born a boy. Most of the time, though, I didn't dislike that I was a girl, but it was more of the restrictions placed on me and what was expected from me. I didn't really feel like a girl, but I didn't really feel like a boy. As I grew up and became a teenager, I'd watch the way male characters in films would react to situations, even mundane mannerisms like body language and facial expressions; I almost always could only relate to male characters. But like I said before, I was always aware of gender roles (even if I didn't have the terms to articulate it then), so I'd watch these male characters and think, \"Why can't girls/women act like that?\" or \"Why can't I be like that?\"\n\nBy college, I started learning more about gender studies and lgbtqa issues, and I chalked up my childhood feelings as being internalized misogyny--it's not that I wanted to be a male as a kid, I just idolized what those characters represented to me. That said, I've been thinking more and more about how I actually feel in regards to my own gender and identity. And I'm thoroughly confused (such a plot twist, I know). So overall, I feel like I mainly (maybe 55% of the time) identify as female, I think? I'll get more into that--but the other remaining time, I don't really identify as anything. I know for sure I don't want to be seen as male, so I suppose I'd label that other \\~half as agender. I don't experience dysphoria, but I also don't really see my body and think, \"Yup, I feel feminine.\" It's just kind of there, and I've lived my whole life in my body, so I'm fine with it. But I guess I'm trying to figure out, if I feel like I identify as female \\~half the time, what does that even mean?\n\n\\-Besides concealer, I don't wear makeup anymore except for special occasions--same goes for things like dresses. I dress pretty casually and androgynously. But the thing is, that's gender expression. Makeup isn't inherently female; short hair isn't inherently male; etc. etc. you guys already know this.\n\n\\-Do I feel like I'm female because I act in certain ways? Do I feel like part of me is agender because some of my actions don't feel female? But obviously actions themselves aren't inherently female or male either; like I mentioned earlier, it's about how gender roles are presented in media and how we're conditioned to adhere to the binary, right?\n\n\\-And it can't be related to how I feel about my body because I know that body parts aren't inherently gendered. \n\nI don't know if any of this makes sense. I just feel like I'm trying to figure out a way to make sense and order of my feelings and perceptions but with hazy definitions based around abstract concepts. I know I can identify (or not identify) any way that I feel is comfortable to me, but I can't even make sense of what exactly I feel to begin with. :/ ", "date": "2018-07-30 22:11:05", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/938lax/figuring_things_out_with_definitions_that_make_no/", "author": "MyPrivateMaze"}, {"title": "Pretty flowers for pretty queer me", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-30 22:28:57", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/938qnm/pretty_flowers_for_pretty_queer_me/", "author": "neverforgetyourtowel"}, {"title": "Finally got the hair cut I wanted \u2728", "text": "", "date": "2018-07-30 23:04:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9390zg/finally_got_the_hair_cut_i_wanted/", "author": "smxgkid"}, {"title": "Natural AMAB T levels", "text": "Hi all -\n\nI am AMAB non-binary and trying to learn more about T.

I was asked a couple months ago to be in a wedding party and I said yes. It was my brothers fiancee who asked so sure. This was when I was rejecting myself internally and just going with everyone else's flow. Two months ago I finally came to terms with being NB and gay. I've known since forever but just never wanted to say anything. I came out to just myself really, because accepting it was the hardest battle for me. Not out to my family or friends in any kind of way.\n\nI went to a dress fitting a month ago and was overwhelmed. Everyone else in the party is so feminine and was so excited to try on dresses. I was there dressed a little more masculine which I've learned it really all I've ever wanted to dress like. but I wanted to be there to support the bride so I figured I could do a dress for a day. Tried out dresses, they picked one and it was done. I was so uncomfortable. I had to spend $200 on something I don't feel comfortable in and will never wear again. They were talking about not cutting their hair until after the wedding so we could all have matching hairstyles. I have some dysphoria with having longer hair (is that a thing?) so my heart was sinking. I ran after paying. Didn't go out to eat with them because I felt such regret.\n\nLately I've been regretting it even more. The dresses actually had a problem so we have to go back to pick out a new style. I want to cry everytime I think about it. I don't want to be in a dress. I don't want it to emphasize any of the \"womanly\" curves I have. I want to cancel going to this wedding altogether. I probably can't even afford to go (destination wedding) The dress is non-refundable so I guess I could just let go of that $200.\n\n My anxiety thinking about a dress is getting worse everyday. In high school I would wear a ton of dresses to kinda make up for the rest of me not being feminine enough. So I guess that's the root of it. I don't know what to do and I don't know if I'm being selfish. I have no one to tell any of this to. And I'm sure they'd think I'm dramatic for not wanting to wear a dress. I don't know what answer I'm looking for here.

Over the past couple months I've come out to most of the people I'm close to in my life. First my wife, then my parents, my brother and a close friend who I often discuss personal/family/mental health stuff with. My wife is the only one I see regularly in person, the rest are in another state. Although my mom did come to visit within a couple weeks of that (already planned) and we talked about it a lot more. The only person I didn't come out to directly was my best friend, who I've been friends with about 19 years. He also lives out of state, so we usually talk on the phone and msg regularly on Instagram. He's made transphobic statements to me (not about me, he didn't know then...I didn't even really know then, exactly), that caused arguments between us. I always said something, tried to engage his empathy and explain some things to him in a non-confrontational way, but for the most part I had to actively overlook some problematic or aggressively offensive points of view from him, in order to keep our friendship going. So I was really anxious about coming out to him and what his reaction would be. I decided, for reasons beyond just him specifically, to come out kind of casually on Instagram. I posted a couple things, plainly without a lot of explanation, and figured anyone who wanted to talk to or ask me about it could. So a little over a week ago I got this message:\n\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand your posts on being non-binary. You're my friend and I love you. Please fill me in.\"\n\nSo, I explained to him what it meant. In general and for me personally, with some details about how gender dysphoria had been affecting me mentally and emotionally since before we even knew each other. Things we had talked about a lot over the years...depression, anxiety, eating disorders and a lot more complicated feelings. I told him how it was really difficult for me to come out to myself, to my wife and to my parents, but it's helped me tremendously and I'm going to support group meetings and there's been a big positive change in my attitude and mood that's been pointed out to me by people in my life. I ended with this:\n\n\"Short answer is, I don't identify as male or female, so nonbinary. I'm using they/them/themself pronouns now, instead of he/him/himself. I had a lot of confusion and pain about it, before I had the knowledge and language to explain it. Since I figured that out, I feel a lot better about myself. I would appreciate your support, even if it's difficult to understand.\"\n\n....and I haven't heard a word back from him since. That was Wednesday last week. Instagram messenger shows me he's seen my messages. He's posted pictures of him having craft beers and going to car races with his local buddies (non of which I know, he moved to a different city several years before I moved out of state, we usually just hung out solo when visiting, since he got divorced). Part of me thinks he's just processing, researching and figuring out what to say back and how to support me. Although my gut instinct is that if he was supportive he would have just said something generically positive to me right away, then processed it and figured all that stuff out later like everyone else who I came out to did. Hell, my mom sent me a text as soon as she read my letter, saying \"I still love you\" and was honestly pretty clueless about everything I told her when we talked about it in more depth several times after and asked me lots of questions I already answered in my letter. I don't know if this means he's going to just disappear and never talk to me again, be rude to me or accept and support me, but is just struggling with how to express himself or what. I have a strong tendency towards codependent and conarcissistic thought patterns, in coming up with all the ways someone behaving badly could have their own reasons and that sort of thing. Right now I'm just wondering how long I'm going to have to wait to find out what's going on with our friendship. My wife suggested I could just go ahead and call him and ask him what's up, but I said I already put myself out there and just don't have the mental energy to pursue possibly getting rejected or attacked right now. Since I started coming out, it's been a lot of emotional labor to handhold, comfort and educate everyone I'm making myself vulnerable to, looking for acceptance. It gets exhausting after a while.\n\nI just needed to kind of get these thoughts out of my system.

I've never used reddit before but need advice from the internet so I suppose this is the place to go.\n\nI identify as transgender and non-binary. I have feminine and masculine traits and characteristics and like to express myself and my gender in different ways. I'm afab and am not currently on HRT, nor have I had any gender reassignment surgeries. The person I am possibly pursuing a relationship with is a cis male.\n\nThe issue: So things between us have progressed and now we have a sexual relationship but nothing official at this point. He is my long-time best friend and we talked about what it would be like if we were to date (why it would/would not work). One of the things he brought up as to why it wouldn't work is that he is \"straight.\" This confuses me because I am trans, not female, and yet he seems to like me? I questioned him further on this and he explained that he's physically attracted to me now but if I changed my body, he wouldn't be. This was in reference to the possibility of me starting T. Later it came out that even if I let some of my body hair grow he would be uncomfortable and not want to be with me.\n\nQuestion: So I'm confused. He likes me now and that's flattering but also keeps saying he's straight, so I don't know whether or not I should be offended? (also clarified that being \"straight\" to him means being attracted to *female* and attraction to him means physical *and* emotional.) Basically I have a bad taste in my mouth about this but am doubting whether or not i'm justified in that. Is it okay for someone to say I won't love you if you have body hair? Like for me, I understand the going on T thing would be pretty dramatic but like my body hair is natural and I often like myself with a little leg hair and armpit hair. I mean I understand people can't control what they are and aren't sexually attracted to. But is it unrealistic to want to be with someone who would love me for me and love whatever body I felt best in? Is that even possible?

I was the only child of a single mom, I always hung out with the women in my family while the men watched football or talked about hunting, I was always jealous of all the cute clothes girls got to wear, and still today 95% of my favorite musicians are women (though more and more are non-binary \u2728). But as a boy I never knew how to integrate it or express it safely. I think if I had the freedom to express myself without facing patriarchal violence I would have been much more expressive, artistic, musical, confidant, connected, and emotionally healthy. I would have had a much better idea of how to navigate life because I would have been doing so as with my authentic voice. So much of my self-doubt has evaporated since identifying as agender (but there's still plenty left \ud83d\udc40) and whenever I feel most in my power I also feel thoroughly non-binary. I'm grateful to have developed this integrity and clarity now rather than never, but good lord it came with so much violence, abuse, and misery. Sometimes I feel a deep mourning for the agender childhood that I never got to have, but imagining it and giving it to myself as I can in the present (\ud83d\ude2d) is an okay though very very late consolation prize? kind of? ugh\n\nAnyways, on a happier note, I want to say that a good half* of everything I'm saying right now is thanks to all the trans and non-binary kids and young adult books I've been reading lately!! They've been deeply cathartic and affirming, and I want to gush about them right now but instead I'm going to start writing mini reviews for each of my favorites :) I want to support the writers who are supporting me, and help share their stories. Stay tuned.\n\n*the other half (honestly way more) is thanks to all the women, femmes, and queers who have held me accountable and helped me heal from my violence, abusiveness, and masculine/patriarchal internalizations. I really cannot repeat that enough.\n\nThis feeling of finally integrating and expressing feminine binary traits is what has gotten me to start IDing as trans in the past few months. I've been IDing as agender since last September, but only IDing as trans since this past April. I've been having a lot of shifts in how I experience what is often thought of as feminized traits / behavior / experience / etc. Including a vastly deeper understanding of the intergenerational trauma in my family and in the history of the world.

I changed my name on social media and am saving up to have my name legally changed irl. I have begun correcting people who dead name and misgender me, and am getting dead named less and less. Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of \"the guys\". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. \nThese days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn't think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn't straight let alone trans or nonbinary. \nBut even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder. Honestly, I have no idea how I'd go about starting HRT and truly feel no desire, right now anyway, to have any surgeries. Am I supposed to feel this way?

I see a therapist every two weeks and while I chose her because she does have a background in transgender issue, I do not see her explicitly for gender therapy, but rather for an anxiety disorder and depression. Obviously, gender comes up sometimes, but I was urged by my mother and my partner to go to therapy following a severe panic attack I had at a family party, again, an incident that had absolutely nothing to do with my dysphoria.\n\nOne of the things we have talked about a couple of times are about my thoughts on starting HRT, which I find myself going back and forth on constantly. Most of the time, wearing \"womens clothes\" and makeup is enough to calm my dysphoria, but other times it still doesn't feel like enough. I'm almost positive that I'm still non-binary, but the appeal of looking/being read as slightly more feminine (a non-binary transwoman?) sounds amazing. I don't have genital dysphoria, I don't care if I don't grow breasts, and my voice doesn't both me, but I would love smoother/softer skin, finer/less course body hair, and the fat distribution that I've admired in FtM timelines I've seen. I've told my therapist, \"The idea of never feeling like a man again doesn't sound too bad, but the idea of never feeling like a woman sounds like a nightmare.\" Of course, I also have a lot of reservations, namely what if the hormones work TOO well and I look TOO different, scaring off my partner and family.\n\nAnyways, yesterday, something came up during our session that has really got me thinking and flung into a bit of a crisis. We talked about how my anxiety and depression have been extremely high (as in much higher than what I consider my normal level of anxiety) the past 4 or 5 days as has my dysphoria. This led to a discussion about how when I have panic attacks or when something in my life OTHER than dysphoria triggers my anxiety and/or depression, dysphoria often follows shortly afterwards.\n\nWhat I've been trying to figure out is whether or not there is a correlation between the two or if I just happen to have both anxiety AND dysphoria? More importantly, might my anxiety dissipate if I start HRT? In other words, do have anxiety because my body/mind is secretly craving HRT even when I don't THINK dysphoria is to blame? Because I get anxiety from a lot of other things, not just my assigned gender. Namely, my anxiety stems from pervasive thoughts that I'm a failure, that everything I've ever done and ever will do is wrong, and that I'm a burden to everyone I come in contact with. When my anxiety is very high (as I mentioned it has been lately), I often times slap myself in the face repeatedly, pull my own hair, choke myself, and/or yell at and insult myself in the mirror. I don't really care about my own health, I have very little hope for the future, and I wake up every day thinking about how many hours before its socially acceptable for me to go back to bed, but again, these thoughts don't hinge on my dysphoria. Still, could these thoughts be an extension of dysphoria without me knowing it?\n\nI know these are questions that only I can answer for myself, but my question to all of you is whether or not you have heard of this kind anxiety/dysphoria connection or perhaps experienced it yourself?

Just never responded. He's the last person I'm close to who I've come out to. i waited for him to ask me about it, because he's made aggressively transphobic remarks to me in the past (not about me, because he didn't know then, but we argued about it). My wife asked if it was ok if she reached out to him and offer to be a sounding board and I told her it was her business, as long as she wasn't going to chew him out or anything on my behalf. When she offered to tell me what they talked about after, I said no a couple times and I wish I hadn't caved and let her tell me, because it only made me mad. It was kind of the greatest hits of casual transphobia. Constant misgendering (I told him my pronouns in no uncertain terms), he can't wrap his head around even the concept of it, he feels blindsided and betrayed because I never seemed anything but my assigned gender to him (he told my wife he feels like he did when he found out his ex wife was cheating on him), I seem confused and should get back to him when I figure things out, there's just XX and XY, but you know...he just wants me to be happy. All of this to my wife, he's never talked to me. \n\nI offered to send him links with more info to explain in detail, but he never got back to me and asked. My wife apparently also offered and he never asked. The last thing I messaged him was something like \"I would really appreciate your support, even if you don't completely understand\" and I was hoping for even an halfhearted show of support like \"I don't get it, but I support you\", but apparently that was too much to ask. I've been debating whether or not to send him one more message or just write him off. At this point, if he hits me up in weeks or months, trying to be supportive, I feel like it's going to be too late. We don't live in the same state anymore, so we only talk on the phone and text. So if he couldn't just fire off a few words to me in almost 2 weeks, but can trash talk me to my wife, I don't know if the history is worth the emotional labor at this point. It also kind of left me with a bad taste that all of his reactions to my wife were about him and how me coming out affected him and personally hurt, shocked or left out him...but he could never even slightly show empathy to how I feel. When I told him why I came out, I said I had a lot of dysphoria, which lead to depression and anxiety for decades and coming out helped in a huge way.\n\nAnyone have any feedback? I could go either way here, honestly. I stayed confused, questioning and then in the closet so long, I kind of don't even want to waste my time on people who can't at least just show me an ounce of personal respect as a first reaction to me coming out to them.

I am at a point that I want to start solidifying concepts. I have established some constants throughout my games in terms of races sex, reproduction, and gender. For example: Dwarves have no concept of gender and reproduce through a ritual where they craft a baby sized figure from stone, gems, and metal with their friends and family; each member contributing material or to its design (\"May you have wide eyes that see all the beauty of the world\" and then the person who gives that blessing shapes the eyes). Drakin (Dragonborn) in my setting can change sex based on the need of the community (if there are not enough egg layers then the hormones of some will change) and Avians (Aarakroca), males have more show feathers and are more brightly colored. Elves have thousands of recognized genders but there is very little difference based on hormones (all fall into a more androgynous appearance based on human standards) .\n\nIn this draft of the guide I am using two entries for each race \"Sexual Dimorphism\"  to go over typical difference based on hormones and reproduction and discuss and \"Gender Variation\" to go over more of the social roles and views of gender and personal identification and expression. This is the best I have been able to come up with but I am afraid it may not be the best way to sort this of stuff out. These sections will mostly be blurbs, no more than 2 sentences, but I want them to be meaningful.\n\nAny advice on handling this would be amazing.

But in the past I've loved having rough stubble ). \n\nI'm stuck feeling as though I might have a girlish side to explore, but I'm both: a) terrified of opening that door and being \"really trans\" (which I recognize is a medicalist/problematic opinion, and I'm trying to stop thinking it, but it still makes me afraid), and b) afraid that by exploring and claiming labels like \"trans woman\", \"transfeminine\", or even \"gay/lesbian\" (since if I'm a woman that makes me gay??) I'm doing a really bad thing by *appropriating* the experiences of women and gay/lesbian people and nobody in the queer community will accept me because I haven't lived that struggle and I'm not actively trying to look more high-femme or medically transition (yet?). \n\n**Just generally feeling stuck... TL;DR:** \n\n\\- Not sure how to deal with huge washing amounts of fear I get when thinking about if I'm a nonbinary woman or maybe a trans woman (which i basically lock down automatically in my brain, I can't even open that up to rly feel it out, i can only handle it at an intellectual level right now) \n\n\\- not sure how to deal with the guilt of feeling like I'm stepping on other people's identities and stealing their hard-earned labels. This is a really big one right now\n\n\\- not sure if what I feel is a part of my nonbinaryness (maybe I'm a demigirl who's happy to be in a masc-ish body) or if I'm actually a trans woman in severe repressed denial\n\nTHANK YOU &lt;3 \ud83d\ude2d if i should've posted this in a different subreddit (is /r/trans a thing?) plz let me know", "date": "2018-08-10 23:50:34", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/96c4hn/amab_enbystruggling_with_how_to_know_what_kind_of/", "author": "enbyquestioning"}, {"title": "Hey!

Today a client commented on my nail polish and said \"are you some kind of poofter??\" and then said \"you have dyed hair but I don't know what you have in your pants\". And I just had to say \"Um excuse me.\" and quickly move on. \n\nThen I had to be alone for a while and found that it gave me a lot of intense feelings and I just wanted to share them. Clients say all sorts of things when you work with them sometimes personal things, but this got me for some reason, in a way that I could not laugh off. \n\nWhen I was younger I used to like appearing quite androgynous, I had long hair and didn't have much body hair. I was often mistaken for a girl which I didn't like and very occasionally people in pick up trucks would yell the F word at me when I was walking home from school which obviously made me very uncomfortable. I feel like I retreated, instead of trying to figure out who I was I retreated into what I saw as the social safety of masculinity.  \n\nIt was more the social dysphoria that really made me stressed and depressed. I lived in a university college and the toxic masculinity that surrounded me and the things that male residents would say to me because they saw me as a dude (along the lines of 'hey man we gotta get you laid', um no thank you/I don't have time to get into everything wrong with what you just said to me). \n\nIt was only after university that I really 'discovered' the enby world, and it just explained a lot for me. I had been going around calling myself bi, which I thought was what my deal was, and it allowed me to express a certain aspect of my queerness which was fine but it also felt a little bit dishonest to myself. \n\nI had to unpack a lot of my own queerphobia when it came to being genderqueer, 'am I just doing this to avoid addressing my complicity in hegemonic masculinity?' 'is this just a fashion?' all of that, before arriving at the conclusion that I think a lot of people come to which is namely that cishet people don't lose sleep over presenting as cishet, and that it's ok to be fucking confused all day.\n\nFast forward to now, and being my colourful queer self trying to help people, and those feelings that made me retreat into my masculinity when I was younger really came flooding back today.\n\nI'm getting more comfortable with my identity and sharing it with the people closest to me but I just wanted to share this with people.

It was specifically penile and testicular cancer that I was obsessed with, only when I had a mental health breakdown at age 20 did I get hospitalized and convinced I was cancer free. \n\nIt is real embarrassing to admit this but I interpreted the discoloration on the underside of my penis raphe and testicles as cancerous which was rapidly metastasizing from there throughout my body.

I do not claim to know her entire history; however, she has had a lot of difficulty comprehending and using common concepts/practices within our community like sensitivity to trauma and triggers, stating our boundaries, asking not assuming, etc. that goes *far* beyond just being new to a space where these are the norm. She is also more or less completely oblivious when myself and others, either verbally or non-verbally, indicate that we are uncomfortable with her behaviour.\n\nAmong one of the things we are struggling to help our new friend with is they/them pronouns. We've tried correcting her, we've tried modelling by example, we've had a friend who used to do gender workshops in schools take her aside and amicably yet thoroughly explain what they/them pronouns signify and how to use them in terms intended for a cisgender middle school audience. Each time she either blows right past the correction or sort of brushes it off.\n\ne.g.  \n**Her:** \"So I asked Bill if I could come see him.\"  \n**Us:** \"Oh hey, [name], do you remember how we explained what they/them pronouns are?\"  \n**Her:** (*unhesitatingly*) \"Yeah!\"  \n**Us:** \"Bill uses they/them instead of he/him, because Bill doesn't identify as male or female but as non-binary.\"  \n**Her:** \"Yeah, I know. That's why I just said his name, Bill. I asked if I could see him--\"  \n**Us:** \"So instead of 'if I could see him,' we say 'if I could see them.'\"  \n**Her:** \"Yeah, that's what I said. So I asked him...\"\n\nI truly want to be sensitive to the fact that my friend clearly has some barrier to learning they/them pronouns and that she means no harm, but on the same token, she is consistently misgendering most of the people in our circle (and gendering them by their gender assigned at birth - e.g. defaulting to he/him for femme AMAB non-binary folks, even though she herself is transfemme and uses she/her), and no matter how we try, she apparently cannot understand that she is doing anything wrong.\n\nIt is getting to the point where I find it stressful and dysphoric to be around her or even to know that she is talking about me, and I know I'm not the only one who feels that way.

Later in our relationship I DID talk to them...but apparently they were too drunk to remember the conversation.

I'm in that spot again where I feel like I need to end it all. My friend just told me about her sibling who just came out to their fiance THREE WEEKS before their wedding.

I also read about possibly going on low doses but I'm not sure how long it would take to have my voice change but I'll probably still get unwanted changes. \n\n((Please try not to make mean comments, if you plan on making one I really kindly suggest you just leave my post, I just genuinely don't know what to do and I hate hearing myself so much it's giving me a lot of anxiety...I'm sorry I felt like adding this is necessary, at this time I'm in a sensitive emotional state and I really don't want to look at any sour interactions towards me.))", "date": "2018-08-20 07:14:27", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/98rhq5/voice_t/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "A friend took this of me and I was really happy with how androgynous I look, even though you could see my bra", "text": "", "date": "2018-08-20 08:50:25", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/98ryfz/a_friend_took_this_of_me_and_i_was_really_happy/", "author": "jessieisabelend"}, {"title": "NB/transmasc/figuring out, pre-everything.

When I was a child I didn't really think about gender roles much, I just sort of did my thing. I remember not doing boyish things (I'm amab) nor really girly things, I just kind of played outside and didn't think about it, and my parents never forced me to conform to anything. So I went through life just kind of calling myself a boy because....everyone else did I guess.\n\nFast forward to college, when I started learning more about identity, gender, et cetera. I started to question what masculinity really was or meant and not getting a real answer. It occurred to me there were (and are) a lot of \"feminine\" activities and means of expression that pretty much flat-out aren't options for me unless I want to be ridiculed or worse.   \nIt began to occur to me how much people who are otherwise kind to me will overtly shame me or get leery if I seem to stray too far from what they think I ought to do because they see me as male.\n\nEventually I started going by a sort of \"nickname\" that sounded suitably gender neutral based on an online username I use everywhere but here. It just happened to work out that it shortens to an actual real name. So my friends call me that. Once I pushed for having them call me they/them pronouns because that feels nice somehow, but then I got cold feet and backpedaled hard. I'm asking for that again and everyone's been supportive, but they all remember the first backpedal and I can feel myself wanting to run away from the controversy again. So I guess I just want to know if I truly have any right to ask this of them.\n\nThe thing that makes me wonder if I'm legitimately NB is that I don't exactly feel dysphoric. At least not consistently. Some days I'll wake up and see my body hair and facial hair and my broad shoulders and I'll feel intensely depressed that this is me forever. Sure, I can shave, but I have sensitive skin and it hurts no matter how careful I am, and even then I still speak with this gross baritone.  \nBut then other days I'm content to speak in my chest range and let my facial hair grow out and all that.  \nWhat often bothers me more than anything is knowing I don't really get a choice. Unless I radically commit to one or the other people will just default me to male. But wanting to be able to choose isn't the same as identifying myself as one thing or another. Maybe I'm just a man in denial who just likes \"girly\" things sometimes? I don't know. I don't know anyone like me. The only nonbinary people I've met are consistently just....neutral. They're between or without gender, and I feel like I'm just indecisive. \n\nI know it's probably kind of poor judgment to spill things out in a public forum on this level but anyone I've asked in confidence has shrugged and said \"I wouldn't know,\" because none of them are nonbinary themselves.\n\nI would appreciate any feedback or thoughts anyone here might have.

I feel like even my friends categorized me differently (which I later learned was true, I'll get to that in college).  I always just thought I was a tomboy, but I was still different from my tomboy friends, too.  I couldn't place what it was, so I asked my mom, and she said it's because I'm from Pluto.  \"OF COURSE!!\" my pre-teen brain thought.  That explained everything.  I don't fit their Earthly norms because I'm not from Earth.  Perfect!  From that moment on, I was much more comfortable with my being different, and that's what I told people when they questioned my social behavior or anything else about me.  Also, note that I didn't get sex-ed until I was 14, and all I remember is the terrible pictures of STDs.  It was very hetero-oriented from what I can remember, and if lgb stuff was included, that's all it was: \"LG &amp; B\", no \"T\", no \"+\", no gender information.  Anyway...\n\nEnter college.  I've experienced having my first long distance relationship and my first almost live-in relationship.  My first being with a girl, and my next being with a guy.  My parents find out I'm bisexual.  I find out my dad saw it coming and my mom might think it's a phase.  I never confront her about it.  I make a great group of accepting friends, who start calling me an android because of how easily I get through the classwork and pick up on learning new things.  Again, OF COURSE!! I'm a Plutonian android.  That's why I'm different.\n\nThen, in our last months my friends make a realization that we only have 1 girl from our original starting class in our soon graduating class and that's Maria.  So I say \"what about me?\" and I get the happy response \"D?  You're not one of the girls.  You're just D.\"  \"D\" was what they actually called me, short for my birthname.   I laugh about it, but inside I realized they were right.  It was obvious to them, just like being from Pluto and being an android.  The funny thing about the plutonian android thing as that most people just laugh about it until they really get to know me and then they actually start to believe it.\n\nFast forward about 9 years and 3 more boyfriends.  We come to the end of last year, when I met my now girlfriend who is gender fluid.  I still hadn't found the right word for what I was, but she introduced me to binders and nonbinary and so much more.  Hmm, nonbinary?  What is that?  I began my research, which eventually ended up in me joining tumblr and realizing that if I'd been on tumblr when I was 12, I would have figured this all out years sooner than I eventually did.\n\nNow, we come to last night where I'm talking to this new person I met at the Coming Out group that I attended for the first time.  We went through all of the above pretty much, and she makes a comment that just about nails everything together.  The gist of it was: \"I love how you went through all these moments of coming up with your own identity because you were never taught that there was an identity out there.\"  We talked a little about coming out, but didn't get very far before it was time to go home.  \n\n**The Bottom**\n\nIt wasn't until I was responding to someone else's comment on another thread that I realized I can use this all of these stories as a method of getting into the topic with my mom.  Just a simple \"hey mom, remember when I asked you why I was different and you said it's because I'm from pluto?  I want to talk to you about the actual reason...etc. etc.\"\n\nSo yea...gonna let the brew a bit and bring it up at the next group meeting for advice if I get the courage...", "date": "2018-08-21 20:10:02", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/996jug/trying_to_come_out_to_mom/", "author": "iammous3"}, {"title": "ELI5: Official Docs and Principal", "text": "Hi everyone, \nIn an ideal world if post this on ELI5, but given the topic I feel like things might get toxic quickly if I do. \n\nI\u2019m male cisgendered and heterosexual, so I\u2019ll start with the following statement:\nI can not, and do not, pretend to know what it\u2019s like to identify as non-binary or have any other sexual preference to mine and live with the accompanying prejudice and associated emotions.

I kinda sat there and contemplated for a while before giving up and circling F (that\u2019s what it says on everything else)\n\nThe other day I was talking to a friend and he said he couldn\u2019t fight me because he wouldn\u2019t hit a girl. And in my head I was saying \u201cwell then you should have no qualms with hitting me\u201d\n\nTold my parents I wanted to use they/them pronouns. After a week or so, they went back to she. Ugh.\n\nWhy is everything gendered?It\u2019s always \u201cniece\u201d and \u201cdaughter\u201d and I always refer to myself as their child, a neutral title for a younger person.\n\nA kid came out as trans and like everyone immediately switched to the right pronouns for him and everyone was super accepting.

One really good description is in the essay \"Boygasms and Girlgasms\", by Julia Serano, linked here: [http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf](http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf).  It is mostly SFW and covers far more about the effects of MtF HRT than just sexuality.\n\nI think that it's interesting that both MtF and FtM folks typically describe greater satisfaction with their sexuality after starting HRT.\n\nMost discussion of HRT here seems to center around reshaping the body, but Serano conveys a very palpable satisfaction with how her senses have changes and how she experiences life internally.  I must admit that I feel a tinge of jealousy. ;-)  Acknowledging how I felt made me wonder if I'm actually MtF also.\n\nI wasn't really that interested in HRT until I started reading accounts of how people change how they feel inside, not just the face in the mirror.\n\nSo... I'm wondering what experience I could expect if I start HRT as an AMAB enby.  Of course, I don't mind to hear about AFAB enby experiences, as well.\n\nThe first question that comes to mind is what HRT regimen I might possibly benefit from.  I frequently hear of MtF folks taking steps to reduce their T levels to near 0.  My understanding is that healthy cis women naturally have a significant amount of T in their bodies, just far less than men.  As someone who enjoys the outdoors, I would be very wary of dropping my T levels to 0.  And besides, I identify as enby; I think I would enjoy a more androgynous body; I'm not looking for curves to attract guys and I would like to keep the great part of my musculature.\n\nThe second question is supposing that I adopted an HRT regimen that would keep my hormone levels somewhere between healthy male and female levels and it helped me develop a more androgynous body (a big if), how would my \"inner experience\" compare to the inner experiences of binary trans folks?\n\nAMAB enbies, what are your experiences with HRT like?", "date": "2018-08-24 04:36:52", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/99uh72/what_is_hrt_like_for_amab_enbies/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "Another analogy for why you enjoy HRT: You were driving a car with the wrong fuel!", "text": "This is flagrantly stolen from another post I saw out in the wild, but I just have to share it here because it's so awesome.\n\nThe best-known analogy for being trans is \"being born in the wrong body\".\n\nI came across an analogy earlier today I think is just brilliant and particularly relates to HRT.\n\nFor those of us who need HRT, being trans is like driving a car with the wrong fuel!", "date": "2018-08-24 04:42:23", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/99uic2/another_analogy_for_why_you_enjoy_hrt_you_were/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "seeing a doc about starting T tomorrow", "text": "I've been gearing up for this for the last year and a half or so.

I finally was allowed to cut my hair short and boyish, and immediately I recognized myself and felt so good. I hated having long hair so much (I recognize that this is self expression and not gender necessarily, since anyone can have long hair, but it felt like I was a \u2018short hair person walking around with long hair\u2019). I don\u2019t often hate my bottom parts, but occasionally I\u2019ll feel gross about them as well (but I know for certain I do *not* want a dick, I don\u2019t want t, and I don\u2019t feel like a man at all).\nThe anxiousness came back full force tonight because I saw a video of a nonbinary youtuber showing their transition through top surgery. It was a great video, and as it went on it scared me because I already knew I hate my breasts, and I *have* thought about getting them off, I\u2019ve just tried to avoid thinking about it because that\u2019s such a big thing to me. Seeing that video made me realize that I do want that, and it scared the shit out of me being faced full-force with that realization. I have a huge fear of both needles and surgery which doesn\u2019t help, but that isn\u2019t even the main fear. It\u2019s just.. such a huge sudden change (which I don\u2019t deal well with). And it\u2019s permanent. I\u2019ve had nightmares about getting *tattoos* because that idea of unalterable permanence and commitment just scares me.\nAt the same time though I felt relief..? I think from knowing something about how I feel for certain. It\u2019s nice having that mental and emotional confirmation, but of course it\u2019s mixed with the fear that something that I really really want is so *big*.\nI really needed to put this somewhere, and I\u2019d really appreciate some advice/I\u2019d like to know if I\u2019m the only one who\u2019s felt this way about top surgery?", "date": "2018-08-25 11:22:45", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9a63ju/upsetscared_mixed_with_strange_relief/", "author": "LiquifiedBakedGood"}, {"title": "Feeling happy after a festival where I felt ok expressing my true self, came back to my mom kinda liking my nailpolish.

Grow my body hair out. Just what it says on the tin, let everything go and see where it takes me. This decision is easily reversible if I end up not liking certain patches/just can't live with armpit hair. Also, my workplace is not very open for something like this (body hair on AFAB would be seen as unprofessional) so I'm going to invest in a handful of business appropriate leggings/stockings so I never have to go bare-legged to work. \n2.

I will leave it long enough to style for a professional office space.\n3. Get a binder for masculine days. My boobs are obnoxiously big (E cup) so not sure how this is going to go.\n4. Invest in a more androgynous wardrobe. First off, pants are the literal devil, so only skirts for me. But I was thinking I could mix and match masculine and feminine styles and maybe buy some oversized sweaters to pair with those leggings I am buying. Either way, I want to lose about 30 pounds before I start looking to supplement my wardrobe (this number is mostly so I can feel more healthy, but also to get me down to a size range where I know I can find clothes that will fit). I've already started losing weight and am hopeful that I can be down those 30 pounds by the new year and get some new/used clothes as a Christmas present to myself. \n5. Actually learn how to use my makeup kit. I want to be able to make my face more masculine and makeup is the easiest way for me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy biggest concerns: \n\nI'm honestly really nervous about this whole plan. Even though I have been thinking about my gender for 5 years, and toying with the idea of transitioning for nearly 3 months, it's terrifying to actually have a plan in place. I'm mostly scared that a) I won't like the changes to my body/presentation, b) I will face a lot of ridicule for choosing to transition, and c) I will get part way through it and realize that I was kidding myself the whole time and the gender I was assigned is actually correct (this one I know isn't going to happen, but I can't seem to convince my emotions that this isn't a phase). \n\nThe other concern I have is with my husband. He has been unbelievably accepting the entire way (his exact words were: \"It's your body, do what you want. If you want to be a dragon, I will buy you frickin scales. Now hand me the ice cream.\"). However, we have talked about this fairly seriously and his one big thing is that he has always seen himself as very heterosexual and very cisgender, never a question in his mind. He says that he will support me no matter what I decide, but it will just take him a little while to wrap his mind around not being in a straight relationship. So I am a bit concerned about straining our marriage. We've done well so far and I really love him, so I don't want to cause him stress. I'm also scared that my transitioning might harm some of his relationships with his conservative family. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my novel.

For those that aren't the best with other European languages, gender goes a lot deeper than just pronouns (which is most of the language issue in English along with other words that we can mostly get around-sibling instead of brother/sister, spouse instead of husband/wife etc.) and has an effect on nearly any sentence describing someone. For example, if I were to say \"[he is/she is/they are] a good student\" in either language 4 of those words require a gender marker. Literally everything but the verb (verbs are awesome and don't give a fuck about gender). \n\nSo I'm looking for **native speakers** to point me in the right direction for resources or advice on how to approach these to teach them more inclusively (and to better express myself as well).

Which is to say: I wear dresses a lot, I'm on a heavy dose of estrogen, and I almost always wanted to be included with women. I refer to my orientation as \"sapphic\". I love the Prince lyric \"I'm not a woman, I'm not a man, I'm not something you can ever understand\" but after quoting it I always wonder about that first part. And the first time someone who didn't know my pronouns called me \"ma'am\" it absolutely made my day.\n\nBut being nonbinary is also an important part of my identity too. It's a more nebulous, but also more closely held thing. It's tangled up in my spirituality, my very most private thoughts, all the things I never tell anyone. It's more fundamental to me than my presentation.\n\nI think what help me square this circle is the glorious Rebecca Sugar [calling herself a nonbinary woman](http://snapbacksteven.tumblr.com/post/176182701477/rebecca-sugar-at-sdcc-2018-talks-about-being-a).

I guess right now I'm just worried that, if I try to explain this to people, will they accept it? Philosophically I know I shouldn't care, but practically speaking...I'm already so isolated I don't want to say something that might put off some of the people who are willing to accept me as nonbinary and trans. You know? I lose enough people over the stuff that's important to me, as well as over being autistic and constantly screwing up basic social interactions. And I guess it's not even about being outright rejected, so much as being subtly looked down on in some ways.\n\nI guess when I try to write out what I'm worried about here, it doesn't really seem that bad. I've introduced myself as \"a nonbinary lady\" a few times now and no one's questioned it or had a problem with it. I don't know.

However, it's just not fitting anymore, and I want to move a little more forward on my 'quest' to find a different name to go by, inspired by a couple of classmates who also are going by different names, and that two different people (a teacher and another student) mentioned that 'I didn't look like a Jessica'. Honestly, feeling rather relieved by hearing that definitely is a sign. \n\nAcross online platforms, I've been using Jae as a name, and while I do like the name a lot and it certainly feels better than Jessica, I don't particularly feel that it's perfectly 'right' either. So, I'm trying to test some more out, and need suggestions. \n\nI'd say that length varies wildly, because I do like short, three letter, one-syllable names, but there are many others, being four letter and longer, that I also tend to go to. \nI think I'd like to go for the more masculine side of gender-neutral, or more unusual gender-neutral names. \n\nI kind of want to get some ideas that are similar to Jessica, but also some different ones. Because that I feel like it may help, some names that I've always loved includes Corbyn (Cory), Eli, and Sawyer.

I'm late 30s AFAB and I\u2019ve always been androgynous/more masculine-presenting. I've been out as queer for 20 years, but only recently accepted that I'm NB. It\u2019s been a lifelong journey to get here. Though I'm sure younger folks have plenty to teach me, I\u2019m particularly interested in hearing from any older  (\\~35+) NB folks who have discovered/accepted their identity later in life.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing I\u2019m struggling with is whether or not to bother coming out. For me, this involves asking people to use a shortened version of my birth name (90% of people in my life already use the name I like), probably using they/them pronouns (still deciding how I feel about that, I think I like it), and not being called girl, sister, etc. My spouse and some close friends know, and they're great. It's been weird, but OK. I have spent my entire life building a happy queer/liberal bubble around myself, so disclosing my identity doesn\u2019t feel unsafe. I worry a bit about future employment, and I am terrified of telling my elderly parents, but otherwise I feel very little risk. I guess coming out this time around feels less exciting and more like...a hassle?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn the one hand, disclosing my identity is really cathartic because I have been carrying this baggage around for so long, and it\u2019s nice to know other people might begin to see me the way I see myself. This is a huge internal mental/emotional shift for me, but unless I tell other people about it, they will continue assuming that I identify as a masculine woman and a lesbian. On the other hand, it feels sort of anticlimactic and not worth the trouble, unwanted attention, and potential discomfort/confusion from others. At times I feel like I\u2019m making too big of a deal out of this. But then I realize that \u201cnot really worth it/too complicated\u201d was the excuse I used for 20+ years to repress my feelings around gender identity, and that didn\u2019t go so well.

I'm going to take you away to a place where you can experience all of them, and no one here will ever need to know about it.  It will be our special secret because you know what?

You were made this way for a reason, and when you grow up you're going to treat other people kindly, just as I do for you, okay?  You don't need to be afraid anymore.\"\n\nAnd then, she takes me away somewhere, and I become a girl for the duration of this fantasy, and she takes me shopping for swimwear, and I curiously try on everything I can get my hands on, and no one judges that I am foolish, weird, gay, or what have you, and I have a great time, and then she finally takes me back to the beach attired as I desire, and I play in the surf until I am utterly exhausted while my newfound guardian protects me from those jellyfish that I hate so much.\n\nWouldn't that have been a trip!", "date": "2018-08-31 05:06:43", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9bqsqr/ruminating_on_the_earliest_signs_of_gender/", "author": "ExcellentTraffic123"}, {"title": "I thought I fully understood myself (gender and expression wise).

Both genders felt foreign to me.\nWhen I was 15 I got romantically involved with an older boy - he was 20, I know that's pretty messed up- who kept pushing me to be more \"girly\" asking me to wear make up and stop being boyish and it made me so uncomfortable. That until he dumbed me, and it wracked my self-worth.\nAfter that I became obsessed with being a \"girl\" I did everything from make-up to pretty girly cloth and I did succeed and was very female passing and very attractive and I remember I used to get pretty upset when I get misgendered ( when someone uses he/him pronounces) .\nBut it made me miserable, it only fed my insecurities and I felt ugly/worthless whenever I didn't dress like a girl or wore make-up.\nI was pretty depressed then, I didn't feel better until I stopped pushing myself, stopped wearing make-up and overly girly cloth. \nThe more I became gender neutral the better I felt, and that when I learn about Nonbinary.\nIt made so much sense.\nI don't feel like I identify as strictly a male or female, any pronounce is fine with me, even tho she/her is more appealing cause idk I'm  used to it?

Breasts (or the appearance of having breasts) feels different though. Sometimes it's a dysphoria thing, but sometimes it's purely a matter of fit. There are tops and dresses that I own that just don't look good without wearing a padded bra.\n\nSo my question to you all is whether wearing a stuffed bra trivializes my gender identity.

Any time I bring it up, though, he's incredibly evasive and tells me he doesn't want me to have it done, and that he's not sure he'll still be attracted to me. The very strange part, to me, is that he's bi (but doesn't like labels... regardless he's attracted to men as well as women). Nothing I say seems to make sense to him, and any time we talk about it it ends in a fight or us not speaking to each other. I'm really at a loss.\n\nSome background: He's been going to therapy the last few months (his therapist is a transman, for the record) and still refers to me as \"she\" and my birth name, while my roommates do not. Additionally, he immigrated to America to be with me. His excuse of \"I don't want you to change\" seems ridiculous to me since we've both changed plenty over 8 years, and being afraid of change at all after moving 4,000 miles seems a bit ridiculous.\n\nAnyway...

My skin is still soft, my face is still feminine, the curves on my body are still feminine, and my body hair is barely visible. I don't want to go back to having a male body. I don't want that male scent. I don't want the rough skin. The muscular body.

If you haven't heard of it, it is basically a forest which is on a property that has been owned by a coal mining company (RWE) for more than 40 years, and when they aquired it coal was huge and tjey got a contract about owning the entire territory. They have already cut down most of the forest and turned into a huge hole. They have also forced residents in several villages around the forest to move. They gave them housing elsewhere, but still, their home is destroyed, and the government allows this because, well, coal money. The forest is very old and beautiful and there are plant and animal species in it who are threatened to go extinct. So some activists have been occuopying the remains of the forest for 6 years now, to protect it. They live in tree houses and the forest has become a space for all sorts of people where they can just exist, teach each other skills, discuss, sing and live in peace. Also there are a lot of nonbinary people there, since the community is so accepting. But now the government has ordered the police to evict everyone and destroy the tree houses. For more than two weeks now, the whole territory was circled by police and people were randomly searched for \"dangerous items\" such as brushes, ropes and fire extinguishers. (actual examples of what was confiscated). There was a lot of fake news on the media too, some of which was corrected. They maintained things like that activists had erected burning barricades, or that they had dug a tunnel system from which they were to attack police when the forest is evicted. This was complete bs and made up to make the activists look dangerous and crazy.\n\n\nYesterday, the government ordered the police to chase everyone out, for \"fire safety reasons\". After taking away their fire extinguishers. Today a lot of activists were already escorted out. Tree houses were destroyed and the first trees were cut down. \n\n\nIt just makes me so sad. The people who live there have created something so beautiful. It was experimental, peaceful, accepting, and a lot of people got to live as their true self there. They created fascinating art there, tree houses, taught each other life skills. It was so nice and nothing like the image the media paints of it. It makes me so angry that we don't get to live as ourselves in our day-to-day lives. This was a place of freedom. Why does the government not see that this is very important to a lot of people? There are big rallies against it every day now, people are protesting all over Germany. It is not even clear yet if RWE will be allowed to mine and burn the coal because there are several lawsuits going on. \n\n\nI am just so sad and frustrated that this is taken away from us and from the planet. Having been there a lot, I can not stop wondering what life could be like if everyone could live as accepting and caring as these environment activists. The government could force RWE to close all the coal plants because they are older than 25 years and therefore unsafe. But no. Coal profits are more important that humans, the environment, and the beautiful community that has existed there for 6 years now. And God forbid the people experience what it is like to live a life of freedom and acceptance. They might refuse to bend over backwards for their greedy bosses or to force themselves into performing a gender they are not because their job and their literal livelihood depends on it. \n\nSorry for the rant.", "date": "2018-09-13 19:20:32", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9fkz45/need_to_vent_about_political_situation/", "author": "AlfieBilly"}, {"title": "Scrolling through my photos and the ones where I look more andro always make me feel more like myself.

I posted the following on Friday:  \n\n\n\"It's weird to look at old pictures. At this point I can recognize that I looked conventionally \"pretty\" and in some ways miss that, but I also know that when I was younger I felt so miserable in my body and detached from it.\n\nMy body was my enemy and I never felt good enough, and no matter how I dressed or how much makeup I wore, I felt like my body was betraying the way I felt inside. I always wanted to be \"one of the guys\" and I \"wasn't like other girls.\" I wanted to fit in but I also felt like I never would.\n\nIt's wild how different I feel now. 90% of the time I'm completely comfortable with myself and I like the way I look. I don't care what other people think of my appearance. I never thought I would be able to acheive that when I was younger. I always thought I would finally be happy with myself if I was thinner, prettier, if my skin was a little clearer, etc.\n\nNow I recognize that most of my feelings stemmed from physical and social dysphoria. I didn't feel like \"other girls\" because I'm not a girl. I didn't \"fit in with the boys\" because I'm not a guy. I identify as nonbinary and use \"they/them/theirs\" pronouns instead of \"she/her/hers\" or \"he/him/his.\" Some of you may already know or may have guessed, but I've never made a formal announcement because it makes me nervous. Most media and public perception about nonbinary people is negative.\n\nI've felt this way for many years. I remember wishing I was born a boy when I was around 8. I used to pray before bed that I could wake up a boy. It doesn't have anything to do with my interests, my appearance, or who I'm attracted to, just the way I innately feel. Now that there are more resources around gender identity, I've realized that \"man\" doesn't fit as much as \"woman\" doesn't fit. I am nonbinary.\n\nAnyway, I didn't intend for this to be a long or dramatic post. I've been mulling over posting for a while (like 2-3 years while) and feel like there's no real point in waiting anymore. If you have questions or want to know more about what my gender identity means for me, feel free to send a message. I'm not seeking validation or anything, I just want everyone I'm friends or family with to know.\n\nHere's a song that pretty much sums up my feelings: [https://youtu.be/-LX2kpeyp80](https://youtu.be/-LX2kpeyp80)\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI probably didn't word everything as well as I could have, since it was an off-the-cuff kind of thing. But I'm really relieved. So far the post has gotten 78 reactions, all positive. I haven't gotten any negative messages so far. It's possible that I've been unfriended but I don't watch my friends list super closely or have an app to track or anything, so I can't say for sure. I know a few people who haven't reacted or responded yet are definitely anti-nonbinary, but they haven't said anything to me so -shrugs-.  \n\n\nI was planning on coming out this year on National Coming Out Day, but decided to say fuck it haha.

I know what's down there.\nI was always a bit of a tomboy. This doesn't affect your gender, yes, but I still believe it to be an important piece of evidence.\n\nAt age 11-12, I can't pin down an exact point, I started to question myself. Mainly, my femininity. I didn't like being a girl. I never was into the \"normal\" female things. Being a male felt more natural, but still a bit off. After a bit of research, I learned of being non-binary, specifically, to be neither gender. Finally, I found something that felt right.\n\nNow, I know that just because I wasn't a girly-girl isn't grounds for transitioning, my feelings went beyond that. When I was called she, it made my chest feel tight. Wearing feminine clothes was about the most uncomfortable thing I could do. \nMonths later, I finally convinced my mother to let me get a shorter haircut, and it was as if a piece of me had been restored. I started wearing more neutral/male leaning clothes, and I felt better.\n\nThough outwardly I did all this, I was still in the closet. I had told my mother, but we more or less swept it under the rug. She still used my birth name and pronouns. I didn't mind, as I felt coming out at such a young age was a bad idea. I at least had the insight to know that it could have been just a phase. \n\nFast forward to age 15. I had been living with these thoughts of transitioning for nearly 3-4 years. It nearly drove me mad. I was stuck. I dressed neutral, had a short haircut, and strangers even called me by male pronouns or neutral they/them. It was nice, but I wanted more. I wanted people to call me they/them, and I wanted to be called by a different name. \nI can say for sure I wasn't an SJW. Even online, if people referred to me as a female, I didn't go nuts. I felt mature enough to handle being transgender, but I had no clue how to come out to my peers, the rest of my family, and to have my mother be on board. \n\nI asked to get counseling. I assumed it would help me by either letting me live with these feelings, make them go away, or to help me come out.\nNeedless to say, it didn't. \nWhile my counselor was a lovely woman, she basically told me to just find peace where I was. I had been where I was for 4 years. There was no hope of peace.\n\nFast forward again, into highschool. Everyone knew something was up. Substitutes called me 'sir', people saw the way I dressed. It was hard to keep quiet. I was so close to having my secret out, it just needed to be confirmed. Still, my mother and I never discussed it, and when we did, she always told me to keep it in.\n\nNow, at age 17, living with this for 6 years, I'm ready to come out.\nI want to be known as they/them (though if people referred to me as a female, it wouldn't bug me. I just want to come out of the closet.)\n\nHere, though, if my question.\nShould I come out?\nIs being non-binary something bad? I hear the term 'special snowflake' a lot.\nHow should I go about this? How do I live with this?\n\nTl;dr I have known I'm trans for 6 years, and I don't know what to do.", "date": "2018-09-16 16:40:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9gbzc5/young_nonbinary_needing_help/", "author": "AfraidToAskThese"}, {"title": "Trying to figure some things out", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-09-16 16:44:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9gc0gu/trying_to_figure_some_things_out/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Any enbies in the New England area?", "text": "", "date": "2018-09-16 17:53:40", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9gcknr/any_enbies_in_the_new_england_area/", "author": "LeftyEnby"}, {"title": "Having a dysphoric day...", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-09-16 17:57:24", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9gclpa/having_a_dysphoric_day/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Self portrait to celebrate getting a job and coming out!", "text": "", "date": "2018-09-16 18:40:53", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9gcz6t/self_portrait_to_celebrate_getting_a_job_and/", "author": "BeetrootMandog"}, {"title": "Is it rude to just ask for someones pronouns?", "text": "I'm part of a small editorial office.

I have spoken to them before about it, and when I did Dan was still called Diane and when I asked about their pronouns they said: 'use 'she' or 'he', it doesn't really matter to me.' and because I was used to calling them 'she' and 'her', I continued to do so, although occasionally not correcting myself when I would use male pronouns and I noticed they appreciate that. I did use 'she' and 'her' in the story.  \n\n\nTwo weeks ago, I heard that Dan had changed their name. So that has changed, and I am anxious whether their preferred pronouns have changed also. But we don't speak one on one, so I would have to send a message in which I ask for pronouns. Would that be okay?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe thing that has complicated this issue is that I'm genderfluid myself but not out and still figuring things out, so I might have been overthinking this a LOT. I also have a good friend that is a transman that I do talk to regularly, but I don't even dare to ask him because the reason why I cannot be casual with this is that it is a heavy subject for myself also.

I am (currently identified as) non-binary and also a linguist and writer. So, pronouns are very, very interesting to me. English \"lacks\" a third-person singular pronoun, or so we've all heard. Many neopronouns have been proposed (and some people like them) but a lot of people have taken to using \"they\", as \"they\" as a third person singular pronoun standing in for someone who's gender is unknown or ambiguous is already unconsciously in general usage, no matter how much prescriptivists like to deny it.\n\n\"They\" is all well and good. I like \"they\". However I was reading a book with two non-gendered protagonists and it did become confusing as to whether both of the protagonists were being talked about, and if it was only one, which one. We can chalk some of this up to poor editing but it is still a unique problem to the usage of \"they\" as a personal pronoun and one we're probably going to run into as more and more people assert themselves as non-binary and choose to use \"they\".\n\nSo I was thinking... there actually *is* a third person singular pronoun in English, one that is in general usage, it's just used incredibly rarely and is classified as indefinite. And that is the pronoun \"one\". Even though it's labeled as a third person singular pronoun its usage is currently entirely impersonal... when using \"one\", one is generally talking about a hypothetical non-gendered person and in informal settings you'd likely default to using \"you\" for this hypothetical person. However, does \"one\" have potential as this gender-neutral singular pronoun in English we've been looking for? Or is there a reason I've never seen it proposed? Is it just too weird and stuffy?

First and foremost, everyone has autonomy over their own bodies, both to eliminate rape as a widely accepted occurrence (example: half-orcs)  and letting women chose who / when / or even if they procreate. By default, those who can procreate often end up in positions of power because they wield the most important power of all, the literal power of life. Also, sex work is and has always been a thing, it's literally the oldest profession so it's going to be in my world, but of course their work isn't illegal or frowned upon.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the ideas I had was never referring to any of the children or babies with genders or pronouns, and was thinking there would be some sort of \"coming of age\" ceremony where perhaps they would pick a gender / name, etc. I would also like to enter the \"two-spirit\" concept into my world, and one of the main characters is a non-binary half-orc. BUT I am trying to be consciously aware not to rip cultural stuff from Native Americans, since I keep coming back to some of these things in their culture I think just make sense for my world, especially in the further out villages where community is very important. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe hardest part is obviously the \"show not tell\" reveal; as in when my characters interact what are the societal norms established in a non-binary world? Would you ask pronouns right away or in a non-binary world would pronouns even be a thing? Would literally everyone just be referred to as \"they\"?? What about gendering animals?  ARGH. it's seriously making me crazy how freaking gendered everything is in my head and it's massively bogging down my writing. for example, gods / goddesses exist in the world's pantheon, but am aware these are very gendered terms. I thought of just referring to all of them as gods, but honestly I like the word 'goddess' so much and would like for that to mean something as well. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also looking for gender neutral terms I can use. I only have a few things I've already decided I like; \"Ser\" instead of \"sir\" (and in this case it refers to military rank, not gender) and would like to use the term \"folx\" as a catch all phrase to address groups of people. Are there any other typically gendered terms that you have a better word for?? Like I've seen 'fortify' instead of man-up, etc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay I'm probably rambling and I still feel like I've done a poor job trying to explain why I'm posting on here. Basically I just want to touch base with some non-binary people and ask if there is anything else I should be thinking about making sure I do or don't do. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-09-20 15:31:52", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9hg95r/writing_a_nonbinary_world_suggestions_for/", "author": "ohshitzombiesRUN"}, {"title": "Non-binary, Muslim, and a little lost", "text": "I'm non-binary and also Muslim.\n\n\nI currently wear hijab and, though I actually don't believe it's religiously mandated even for binary women (and, regardless, believe very strongly in freedom of religion --\u00a0\u0644\u0627\u064e \u0625\u0650\u0643\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e \u0641\u0650\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0650\u0651\u064a\u0646\u0650), it's something that feels intensely a part of who I am and that I don't want to give up.

So. One of the things that's most frustrating for me in my transitioning process is that I can't for the life of me decide whether I want to try/start HRT or not. I've been back and forth all the time every day for over a year on it now. And I feel like one of the factors that exacerbates the problem the most, and makes me feel even crazier, is how incredibly few examples there are in pop culture of nonbinary AMAB artists or celebrities who are known for something other than queer/trans/gender activism but are vocal about being nonbinary, and also are not on HRT, compared to AFAB celebrities who fit the same description.\n\nFor most of my life I really didn't give two shits about pop culture, and obviously it all should be taken with a heaping dose of salt, but it feels bleak and frustrating to me how clear the message seems to be that if you \"choose\" an identity-path that means throwing away power and privilege rather than gaining it, then there will be no place for you in society as far as the people who hold power over our biggest cultural-media industries are concerned. It's striking to me that with the recent wave of celebrities regarded by the public eye as \"women\" who have come forward about their nonbinary identities, there has been no parallel wave among public figures who are treated as \"men.\"\n\nI don't like that talking about public perception means I have to divide people based on their birth-assigned gender just because other people do, but I feel like that's unfortunately the clearest way to get at what I'm trying to say. In the AFAB camp you've got actors like Ruby Rose, Amandla Stenberg, and Asia Kate Dillon, all of whom have talked publicly about their gender identities; musicians like Angel Haze and Miley Cyrus who have done the same; also musicians like St. Vincent and Grimes, who haven't been quite as clear-cut in their language about themselves as persons but have talked about seeking gender-neutral or -ambiguous or -fluid spaces in/through their work.\n\nAnd then in the AMAB camp you've got... Eddie Izzard. Who is endlessly endearing and whose comedy I adored in high school, but he is fifty-six entire years old and comes from another time. I guess Sam Smith, based on a single comment he made a year or so back? Shamir. Shamir, along with Sam Smith, is more on the same vibe with St. Vincent and Grimes, I suppose, in that they've essentially voiced how deeply *not* important gender is to their work. Whereas Eddie is more of an Amandla or an Asia Kate. But he is not young like those latter two, who are, significantly, super duper young. And whereas there are more public figures I left off the AFAB list, these three AMAB people are literally the only ones I can think of.\n\nI don't doubt that young artists who are unapologetically vocal about their nonbinary identities and happen to have been AMAB are out there doing great work, but it seems like their industries won't reward them in the same way, because their paths don't fit into marketable pop-pseudo-feminist narratives of (*bleughhh here it comes...*) \"female\" \"empowerment.\" So I guess my question is, whose work should I be paying attention to? What young, creative minds are putting art out there that's worthy of the top of the industry but isn't getting the reach it could have because of who made it?\n\nAll this said, the visibility of nonbinary people who *have* gone on HRT (and, again, are known primarily for something other than gender activism or queer activism) is of course even less, regardless of GAAB. It feels to me like in broad strokes the same principle is operating here \u2014 in the mainstream reading of it, \"changing\" your gender means you're throwing away your inborn/God-given power or potential and that's something not to be desired \u2014 but this could be a subject for a whole other post and isn't really what I'm trying to get into right now.\n\nBasically, in trying to feel out what I want for myself in my own transition, I feel perpetually thrown off by the dearth of examples or role models to look to who have taken a path I'm considering. It's not that I'm interested in copying anybody else's journey. I just have found myself relating strongly to nonbinary celebrities when they talk about their gender identity as something that *is* important to them \u2014 but, except for one who is old enough to be my parent, none of those people have come from the type of upbringing I've come from. It's disheartening. It just is.\n\nIDK, am I wrong? Do I have a confirmation bias someone can call me out on? Where the fuck are we??\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n(I am in my mid-twenties and AMAB, in case that's not evident from what's above. I'm also in the process of changing career paths to hopefully allow myself more time and space to focus on music, art, writing, and organizing, which is part of why these questions feel so big to me.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[Edits: spelling, names, clarification\\]", "date": "2018-09-22 20:13:40", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9i2ozi/invisibility_of_nonbinary_amab_folx_in_pop/", "author": "kindlydisregard"}, {"title": "My thoughts on validity", "text": "I see a lot of people on here worrying that they're not \"valid\" because of the way they like to present themselves.

I'm still more than friends with my ex (male), he's actually visiting right now and showering, so I have some time to type this.\n\nI never got to have therapy and therefore HRT, so I'm still stuck with this male body. For a while after I broke up with my ex, due to literally feeling imprisoned by the \"female role\" I had in the relationship, I thought I was asexual, but I am definitely still sexually attracted to females...or maybe I'm just jealous? Maybe it's part of the dysphoria I keep feeling? But even when I'm alone with him, free to be me, with no mask, I don't really feel female \"enough\" either to consider myself that. But I'd absolutely love to wear the female clothes he and I bought for me over the last few years.\n\nI don't know what I wanna be once I get to break out of my shell... I'm too old to be a girl, to tall to still be cute compared to my ridiculous standards of what I love about female bodies... I can't even figure out who my ideal partner would be, for me to ever consider trying a relationship. I think I need someone more dominant, who'd push me towards actually working on changing things for the better and could help me with body care, make up and such. I've been daydreaming about that a bit, I think I might even consider them my owner if they let me live as their catgirl.\n\nIs it wrong that I could have sex with a female, but hate my dick otherwise? Maybe that's just these stupid hormones telling me that I want sex, when I tried it with him that just satisfied my curiousity pretty much forever, so it might be that all over again, just with maybe a bit more to explore? Idk, I'm not cutting my claws tho... ~~and I'm a stupid pillow princess with back pain as an excuse~~\n\nNot that I know how to get out of this limbo state I'm in, I literally wouldn't know the words to say even if I managed to find and call a new therapist and my mom can't get a hold of the only one who ever seriously talked to me without any bias (and therefore applying their experience to me, which just doesn't work like that). I just can't deal with stuff alone and nobody's here to help me, especially once my ex goes back home next week ;-;\n\nI wish I could just buy a new body, maybe even with cat ears and no disgusting body hair...this one got ruined by growth hormone therapy beta testing anyways, boobs would probably make the back pain even worse...ugh...but being able to pass as female would make wearing female clothes much easier and that's what I really want right now, I think. Maybe actually having a female body would allow me to feel something gender-related again. For now I mostly feel nothing and can't describe what I feel when I'm with him, but it *is* something...\n\nUsually I'd also be crying for attention and hugs, headpats and such, but my ex is here and happy to provide me that...even tho I secretly feel like an asshole for basically using him for that, even tho we broke up.\n\nI haven't even directly mentioned my anxieties (spelling?) about a lot of these things. One big issue I have are my grandparents who I usually see every day, but I feel like they wouldn't understand, my grandpa is already annoyed at my long hair that I've had for years (inb4 r/egg_irl) and my claws... but it's all I have, I'm not happy with my legs and keep losing the war against this stupid body hair...especially if I keep randomly falling back into not doing anything anymore and becoming nocturnal again.\n\nI hate giant walls of text, if anyone read all of this...thank you...a lot.

Im afab and i have quite a lot of chest dysphoria. Long story short : still live with parents, bought a binder, eventually parent found out, threw out my binder, several months after many, many, talks with parent, they've decided that if i lose weight then i can have permission with my own money to buy a binder. Situation still a bit shitty, but hey i take what i can get. \n\nIssue though is having to wait until ive lost enough weight that they can deem i can have a binder, because theyre convinced i only have dysphoria because im fat. Which im not gonna deny, i am fat. Ive actually lost 9 pounds now. But im still having heavy chest dysphoria, and my biggest fear is that if i do get another binder, my chest will still show. My other binder didnt hide all my chest, but it did cut down my dysphoria, and i dont know why, but im afraid im going to lose weight and still be able to see my chest with a binder and still be uncomfortable with myself. \n\nAdditionally, bottom dysphoria sucks too. I dont get it as often, but damn it *sucks*. And it confuses the fuck out of me too. Like with chest dysphoria i know that i actually want no chest, and one day i wanna get top surgery. Ive thought about it a lot (well kinda half to when its always on your mind) and ive read up a lot of the subject, ive never felt comfortable with my chest, and i know about my feeling about my chest. \n\nBut bottom dysphoria really fucks up my head. Like everything down there just starts to feel so foreign and wrong, so whats the opposite to that? Do i want a penis? Do i want a vagina? Why cant i have neither? Fuck. Its like everything downstairs just shouldn't be. Usually i just sleep in boxers, (and let me tell you that if your reading this and also having bottom dysphoria, try wearing a different type of underwear, boxers makes it easier than boy shorts) but on nights where bottom dysphoria is bad i wear pants, which isnt that bad, but when im having bad chest dysphoria i sleep in a hoodie, so most nights im sleeping like fully clothed and its hot as fuck.  Looking into getting another fan for my room tho. \n\nDysphoria also fucks me over with all these questions. Like i know i dont want to be a girl, but does that necessarily mean i want to be a dude? And i thought i had this all figured out that i could just ve nonbinary and be neither, but bottom dysphoria just fucked me up being like \"well if you dont want a vagina and you dont want a penis, what's your plan?

I realized I was NB about a year ago, and it's been a really positive discovery on my life, but I'm still very much struggling on how to present myself. I'm mostly out, but not to everyone and especially not to family/faculty/etc. So right now I'm still presenting masculine, but I want to start changing that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne of the issues I've been facing is that, while I really dislike \"men's\" clothing (as in, clothes you find in the men's section at a store) and find it boring and restrictive, I'm not comfortable wearing \"women's\" clothing either (excluding basics like jeans, shirts, hoodies; I more mean dresses, skirts, etc.), and I really can't find an in-between. I've searched in vain for inspiration around the web, but what I'm finding all seems pretty redundant: hats, vests, ties/bow ties, denim jackets; nothing feels like my style and everything in general feels too masc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm running into a specific issue in the last few days: My college is having a large formal dance event next month, and I'm determined to find a formal outfit that isn't a suit or tux. But when I look online, all I find is vests, ties, and suit pants; everything once again feels way too masc. It's also not helping my dysphoria at all: the images that come up when I search for NB formal wear are people wearing suits that have softer face features than I do. It's making me feel really stuck in how I present.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is mostly just a rant I guess, but I do have a question for anyone who feels like they've been in a similar place. Does anyone have advice for clothes/styles that don't seem to be on any spectrum, and are just truly androgynous? Outside of basic jeans, shirts (which is all I feel comfortable wearing right now), has anyone found clothes that, in your perspective, really don't feel masculine or feminine, but just feel like their own thing?

(AFAB)", "text": "Hey guys! I'm curious about my gender identity. The following will be a long freakin' post lol. Sorry for that, I just want to make sense and not confuse people here. Anyway. since I was a little kid I preferred boy toys over girl toys. My Halloween costumes were also more boyish or gender neutral. I did wear some girly costumes too though. When I was about 4, I cut all my hair off because of how uncomfortable I was. There was always an issue with caring about my looks and making myself look \"pretty\" or feminine. I hated long hair and always rejected it and just my whole appearance in general. Even before puberty, I had an issue with slouching but more so during and after puberty. I just always felt uncomfortable with my chest, I guess? Most of my friends were boys, and I traded and played Pokemon cards with them. Didn't rlly feel like I was a boy deep down, but being like \"one of the boys\" came more natural to me. I felt like I was being fake if I tried to \"act like a girl.\" I was always kinda rough and tough and enjoyed wrestling boys and girls. My sexuality used to be a bit more straight-forward before I got into my teen years. I've always been attracted to females, and maybe feminine guys but not like females. I've dated girls, but always had the issue of sex and kissing. Especially, when I discovered what Transgender meant. I didn't like to show my chest or downstairs area. Now, I don't like it, but I can stand to look at myself in the mirror. I don't want others seeing it. Not because it's \"ugly\" either. My body feels wrong. I've been seeing a gender therapist for about 4 months now and she diagnosed me with gender dysphoria, anxiety, and depression. We also talked about me being nonbinary. Tbh, I've kinda embraced that identity. It feels less constricting and stressful. Since I'm not being pushed into a binary box. I'd rather be called a boy than a girl. But, full on transitioning to a man doesn't appeal to me much. The problem is, I'm not sure how to transition or what I want. I don't know how to feel comfortable. I've gotten boy haircuts, I bind, I wear boy clothes, ect. Yeah, it makes me feel better and stuff, but I just feel lost and depressed still. Heck, the physical changes from T, I don't really want either. A lot of people want their beards, genital growth, ect. Honestly, I'd just take the muscle growth, fat distribution, face shape change. The changes that are more temporary, y'know? Even the acne. Anyway, I don't pass. I'd rather pass as a boy but, I don't wanna be 100% male either. I know I can't control the T, and how fast the changes are. I know I don't need T or top surgery to be trans. That's all well and good. But, I don't know if i'm satisfied with doing nothing either, if that makes sense. I'm just really trapped because I don't rlly dig the effects on T. I just want to feel better mentally, and not dissociate constantly. It's bad, I dissociate when I'm talking because I don't feel like my real self and I stutter, ect. I just want to feel confident and be comfortable with whose looking back at me in the mirror. I just don't know where my goal is. I don't know where my truth is. There's times I actually wanna commit suicide, because I feel like I've never be happy and be my true self.  Whatever that even is. Kay, I'm nonbinary but am I supposed to be more masculine looking? Am I supposed to look like both? Am I gunna be happier with a beard? Ah, I'm exhausted. Can somebody help me out here?

I have felt incredibly secure in my identiy since coming out, until now.\n\nI have become somewhat obsessed with a musician who is a cis woman. I tend to do this, become obsessive over people or things. but she is the type of person I would love to be -- beautiful, artistic..I envy her voice, her appearance, her hair, her sense of style. if I were a woman, she is the type of woman I would want to be.\n\nthis is confusing to me, because I am most often attracted to men. the last time I felt any sort of attraction to a woman was years ago, and I was coming to terms with just being a gay man until I saw this musician in-person.\n\nso I couldn't decide whether I was attracted to her, or whether I wanted to be her.\n\nI never felt comfortable as a woman, but now I'm thinking, was it just because I thought I was unattractive? I hated my hair, the way my body looked and felt to me, although I certainly feel more comfortable being unattractive presenting as a masculine person than a woman, but often it is more societally accepted to be unattractive as a man than a woman.\n\nthing is, this past two years since I've been on hormones have been the best two years of my life so far. I've made friends, I got a college degree, I finally feel like a human being and not a depressed blob. now I feel myself slipping back into depression.\n\nI think part of my insecurities come from not feeling like I shouldn't have transitioned, but from feeling like if I were ever to meet this woman, she'd be repulsed by me, a tiny man. maybe what I'm feeling is internalized transphobia.\n\nbecause then, when I think, what if I woke up the next morning in this woman's body? the only way I could deal with it would be if I covered it up. she tends to wear modest clothing, clothes that cover most of her body and obscure her figure. but actually being in a woman's body, that is not something I feel like I could ever deal with. the only way I could deal with being in a woman's body would be if it were, well, a more masculine woman's body, with no hips, the tiniest of boobs..\n\nbut I know my life would have been easier as a woman. even though I also know that, if I woke up in this woman's body feeling like I do now, I'd still need to transition, no matter how beautiful she is. because I couldn't deal with the bottom dysphoria or ignoring and hating my body the way I did until I realized I was trans.\n\nI think I've just been feeling depressed lately, and my fear of being rejected by people I admire due to the person I am is making me spiral a bit.\n\nI am non-binary, so while I went on hormones and need surgeries to make my body feel more congruent with how I see myself in my mind, I feel now, more than ever, also more comfortable presenting in a more feminine way. pre-transition, I could never dress in feminine clothing because I felt like it accentuated the parts of my body that gave me distress. but now, I feel closer and more comfortable with my femininity than I ever could before. I feel increasing discomfort with being called \"bro\" or \"dude,\" I feel like my non-binary identity has never been acknowledged by anyone other than myself and it's causing me distress.\n\nI needed to ramble on about this and now I feel a little better, but it'd still be nice to talk about it. I feel like I still experience a lot of negative feelings and internalized transphobia, and that I don't actually want to be this woman or any other woman. I think what I have realized is that I am not gay, I am attracted to all genders and my worry is that no one of any gender will ever find me worthy of attraction or love.\n\nI guess i\u2019m worried I transitioned out of hatred for who I was, although I can\u2019t deny that no matter what, I feel much better now than I ever did before, even with these weird feelings\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else here has ever felt this way.\n\nI think my confusion mostly comes from feeling attracted to a woman after identifying as gay for a long time, thus bringing up old feelings of do I want to be this person, or be with them? I wonder if I could have achieved the level of contentment with my life I feel now if I hadn't pursued transition. I worry it was a phase and in a few years and post bottom surgery, I'll feel like it was a mistake...\n\n(cross-posted from /r/ftm, I really didn't receive any responses there)", "date": "2018-09-25 13:05:03", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9irxpa/feeling_jealous_of_cis_women/", "author": "tiny_questions"}, {"title": "I feel so uncomfortable correcting people on my pronouns.", "text": "It\u2019s hard to tell old friends.

I could see people approach from the windows and would, depending on who they were, physically cut around my nipples with a knife, stuffing silicone into the holes and glueing my nipples back in place, or, cut and remove the silicone.\n\nIt was a cycle and reflective of how I change myself daily, hourly, and situationally. And I think it might be harming me by my inability to make a decision. And maybe how I view gender still? I don't know.

I've struggled with ADD, Depression, and Anxiety problems, at school and work especially. I've been so focused on powering through the general anxiety that I didn't realize I was casually dismissing any notion of desire to be feminine. I had all kinds of anxious thoughts that I gave full credence to, such as:\n\n* \"It would be insulting to the trans community to just decide I'm trans.\"\n* \"I don't have crippling dysphoria or hate my male body, so I can't be trans.\"\n* \"I just want to be trans to get attention.\"\n* \"Most men would enjoy fantasizing about being women if they were honest and open minded.\"\n* \"This is all just a feminization kink, and it would be unethical to try to force that on anyone else.\"\n\nBig thanks to /r/egg_irl for cracking my shell. I've realized that euphoria I experience experimenting with makeup and women's clothing is valid and more than just a kink. I've realized that I'm really into the idea of being able to present femininely and pass as female at times I could choose, but I don't want to lose the ability to present masculinely either. I don't hate my beard or my body hair, but I'm kind of desperate to see what I look like shaved, made up, and dressed as a woman. I want to know how pretty I can be. I want to learn how to dress well and wear makeup. I really love the idea of going out with friends as a woman. But I don't want to lose the ability of being able to present masculinely when I want to. \n\nI'm honestly not sure if I will stay genderfluid long term or if this is a stepping stone towards being a transwoman. Right now genderfluid, bigender, or something like that feels right, and I honestly don't think I'm a full on transwoman.\n\nI apologize if this is a dumb question, but I feel like I need to hear it from some actual genderfluid people. Do you consider yourself to be trans? Do you find that others consider a genderfluid person as a type of transperson? How do you go about explaining your gender in public social situations?\n\nIt seems like it's a common story for transwomen to go through a phase of considering themselves genderfluid at first. Does anyone have a sense of the ratio of transwomen with that story vs people who remain genderfluid long term? Have you noticed anything that tends to differentiate these people from the long term genderfluid people? \n\nAlso, how do you feel about pronouns? I don't feel like I care right now, although it's a special kind of rush to be called a girl since it's so new. Do you ask people to use different pronouns when you're presenting differently?\n\nDo you present androgynously most of the time, or do you switch back and forth between masc and femme presentation?\n\n-----------------------------\n\nI'm really excited to explore all of this and find out for myself how I can express my femininity in a fulfilling way, but that excitement comes paired with twice as much guilt over what my wife is feeling right now, and her fear for the future. We've both had one individual session with the sex and gender therapist. She's scared that I'll make a full transition one day and she won't be able to tolerate it. She has had many traumatic experiences in her life, on top of an experience of general romantic rejection from men while easily attracting lesbians. For her, I was a man who reinforced her idea that she is a conventionally attractive woman, but this whole revelation has her feeling insecure about her body and feeling like she's not attractive to \"normal men\". Honestly, she does have a bit of a butch vibe to her, and I absolutely love that about her, and it makes me feel terrible that she doesn't feel good about the way that I'm attracted to her.\n\nAll that said I think she's taking the whole thing very well, considering that in breaking this news to her I'm hitting all of her insecurities with a sledgehammer. Not to mention that she hasn't fully processed the traumas of (all separate instances in different years) her grandfather molesting her mother, abusive drug dealing parents, eviction from her childhood home, the death of a friend in a car accident in high school, her own rape in college, and a 3 month torturous hospitalization that left her with PTSD. Now she can't help but to see me as her most recent trauma, and further evidence that everyone is out to hurt her. She's been suicidal in the past, and now I have to contend with being the cause of suicidal thoughts that she's having now. She resents not having anyone else to talk to (I've given her permission to talk to friends but she's not really ready to do that) and being around me is making her anxious, so she's going to visit family this weekend.\n\nThe whole situation seems really bleak right now, but despite all of that, we're having respectful discussions, and she's comforted by the fact that nothing has really changed yet. She's making an honest attempt to resist her anxious thoughts, and I'm trying to give her plenty of room to vent and not take anything personally at this point. When I showed her a picture I took with lipstick and mascara on, she smiled and admitted I looked cute. She's said she definitely has no problem with men wearing makeup. She hasn't articulated any specific fears she has for the future except that I might transition totally into a woman and she wants to have me as a man.\n\nFurther complicating things is that fact that her own traumas have left her unable to really feel comfortable with herself as a sexual person, and since she's also taking libido killing anxiety medications, she hasn't felt up for sex in months. She's barely even sure what she wants sexually, touch in general just makes her feel defensive. That's what we were originally going to couple counselling for before I had my own revelation that introduced all of these complications. The resentful part of me feels like \"Why do you even care how I wanna look if you're not looking at me sexually anyways?\". I know that's not how she feels, and that she is attracted to me, she just has a mental block around sex in general. If anything, the fact that she was ever comfortable enough with me to fuck me says something about how much love and comfort she is able to feel towards me.\n\nI don't know what I'm expecting anyone to say about all this but I don't have anyone else to vent to at the moment. I'm hopeful, excited, scared, and guilty, and  I think I kind of just want to see your reactions to the shitshow that is my life currently.", "date": "2018-09-28 21:10:08", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9jquzz/28_amab_and_married_and_just_now_realizing_im_nb/", "author": "SildWide"}, {"title": "Decided to comb my hair for once in my life [21]", "text": "", "date": "2018-09-28 22:38:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9jrjt9/decided_to_comb_my_hair_for_once_in_my_life_21/", "author": "porsche_914"}, {"title": "Presenting as nonbinary in public for the first time tonight.

But then at the same time, there are times when I want inch long lashes and a sparkly unicorn face but feel like I can't or shouldn't because people would automatically start using she/her on me again and I feel like all my progress would come to a screeching halt.\n\nI don't know if it's because of where I live or what but I feel like I can't be myself 100% of the time and also use my identifier and it breaks my heart because acknowledging that I'm neither female nor male is the first time I've ever felt happy as me. \n\nAnyone else ever felt this way?", "date": "2018-10-02 19:33:14", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9ktt5d/afab_makeup/", "author": "malcomwarrior1"}, {"title": "Questions about AMAB HRT", "text": "Hey everyone, I've been looking into my options for HRT quite a lot lately,and I have some concerns with some of the things I've seen. Most of the feminization aspects of E and spiro seem to be positive for me, particularly less hair growth (mainly concerned about legs and face), skin softening, etc. I'm indifferent about breast growth, I definitely wouldn't mind a little bit, but it's also not a big goal.\n\nMy main concern is with the the sexual side effects, like difficulty getting and maintaining an erection and ability to produce sperm. This is particularly concerning because it's one of the only effects that can be permanent, and it's unpredictable who it will happen to. I don't have any dysphoria surrounding my genitals and like them the way they are.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience with going through alternative types of HRT?

I don't ever, internally, consider things gendered at all. I only ever even really think about it socially, mostly in terms avoiding shitty behavior towards women.

But my therapist was wondering why I didn't dress more masculine/darker colours like most of her other non binary clients. I tried to pinpoint the more masculine elements of my outfit that were being expressed, but I guess other people just don't see it that way. \n\nI almost wish I had a more masculine muscle distribution just so people would feel more confused when they look at me in what they seem to identify as typically women's clothes. like if I could somehow keep my waist but have masculine shoulders/muscle distribution in my arms and legs that would be ideal. That's what I feel most aesthetically attracted to I guess. I don't know if that's what is right for me and whether I would still want boobs (so fun to squish!) my therapist urged me not to rush into anything (ie changing my body,) which I agree with, and recommended to like be mindful in front of thw mirror to help with my body issues, which I don't really understand?\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how to cope and maybe feel more connected to my body or care less about what society thinks or something?

To play, you have to go through the phone to figure out how to get it back to the owner.\n\nI just finished playing through it on a flight (took me about 2 hours) and it was SO amazing it made me cry. \n\nI'm hoping we can spread more word of this game, because it could really make such an amazing difference as a tool for education in people's lives.\n\nIt's $3, but I swear it is well worth it.

I figured it was just my dysphoric brain screwing with me, and that things would be better after I started HRT. And, I was half right, actually. Going on HRT cleared my mind and made me feel like *me* for the first time since when I was a little kid.\n\nBut that weird nagging feeling remained. It was like there was this barrier between me and transgender women. Like, a lot of their experiences about discovering their femininity didn't resonate with me. I like presenting as androgynous, there are some stereotypically male things I like, and I never really felt comfortable considering myself as a \"woman\". \n\nI thought that it might be I'm just butch, or that I've got some form of internalized transphobia to overcome, but neither of those felt right. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I just want to be a cute, slightly androgynous soft-butch tomboy and not have to act womanly or be male.\n\nI talked a bit with some NB people I knew, and I felt that sense of connection that I was failing to get with binary trans women (or with cis-men) and I kind of realized that...hey, maybe this works for me as well?\n\nSo I guess I'm some sort of mess of a transfemme non-binary demigirl wibbly wobbly...thingy.

Being trans around people is scary, and sometimes more than I can deal with (hell, being around people is sometimes more than I can deal with).\n       \n\n\nI think my big problem is that there are not very many research/statistics, and it is incredibly hard to make an informed decision/calculated risk when information doesn't exist.\n", "date": "2018-10-08 00:31:34", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9ma8g4/hrt_thoughts_looking_for_adviceexperience_cw/", "author": "will0w1sp"}, {"title": "I'm starting to play around with more masc clothing :)", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-08 01:14:00", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9maioy/im_starting_to_play_around_with_more_masc_clothing/", "author": "Nonsense_constance"}, {"title": "Prob just cis but not sure", "text": "I know y'all get a lot of this but I'm really not sure what I am.

I don't shave at all, I intentionally go to the men's section for shirts, etc. I like looking in the mirror and seeing a really cute boy, but I don't think I'd like to see that all the time and I feel like the main reason I like looking like a boy is because I look more feminine then. I'm a medium-feminine looking girl but if I look like a boy I look like a super feminine guy and I really like that. But I also like not looking like any gender, so long as I look feminine and friendly.\n\nSorry this was so long and pointless but I guess I just want advice? I don't feel strongly tied to being a woman or a girl at all besides the fact that my experiences are female, like I feel more tied to being afraid of going somewhere alone at night than I feel tied to being a woman.

I know that there's no strict rules on all this because gender is like, made up by us? so ultimately it souldn't matter, but I'm trying to find some self-validity here. When I read stories about trans and/or enby people, often times I see those people describe how they either knew it from the start, or didn't know exactly but did feel something \"off\" about themselves, and then came to realize what it was when they were teenagers/early 20's (and I am 25 so I suppose that at least checks out). But I just...didn't. I have really fuzzy memories as a kid, but they don't include any dysphoria or frustration being a girl, and in high school I had no problem being a girl. The only major discomfort I felt was when I was 18 (and just realizing I was bisexual) and wanted to cut my hair, but didn't because my mom and hairstlist at the time told me it'd make my face look fat (spoiler alert; I cut it when I turned 20 and it's the best thing I've ever done). It wasn't until college I started feeling this way, and it wasn't even until junior year, just shy of the time that I fell deeply in love with my best friend who is only attracted to men. So sometimes I worry that my non-binaryness is coming from some rooted sadness that the people I'm usually interested in are only interested in men (happened in high school too. Less so now but it's a hard discouragement to shake). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt feels pretty good to ID as non-binary now, but I feel like since I \"wasn't\" until recently, that it can't be true.

Testosterone insensitivity?", "text": "Does anyone here have experience with regrowth after top surgery (macromastia)? Or testosterone insensitivity?  \n\\*Yes, I will see a doctor as soon as possible. I am not looking for medical advice, only possible similar experiences of other people.  \nI'm almost 10 weeks post-surgery and something is definitely not right. For background, I'm AFAB bi-gender, both male and female, and most of the time prefer to have a male body with a female presentation. When I had my surgery even my female side didn't miss my breasts, which were a deflated, floppy DD after massive weight loss. My girl side did want to wear bras though, to make me feel femme when I needed it.  \nI'm beginning to suspect I have two things going on -- a previously diagnosed condition called macromastia (diagnosed when I was in my 20s and went from a DDD to an II in only a few months) and possible androgen insensitivity syndrome.   \nAt about 5-6 weeks post-surgery the swelling went down, and my chest was quite flat, a nice masculine shape. Then in the next week or so I noticed a change in the shape, evenly on both sides, I figured it was just my body working things out, but it kept changing, fast! The upper area, where I am pretty sure the doctor left some breast tissue for shaping, began to grow and become more cone-like. The new cone shape is also starting to expand below the incision lines/bottom of pects, toward my old inframammary line. They seem to be well on their way to filling the soft B cup bras I purchased after surgery, with intent to fill them using breast forms.   \nIn the last week I gained enough mass that now I can create a decent cleavage. I couldn't do that before, not even close. Now my chest skin is starting to feel uncomfortably stretched, the skin is definitely being expanded by this growth.  \nRegarding the suspected testosterone insensitivity, I started T in June 2016, and immediately had a lot of good changes, including bottom growth, and increased hair growth and muscle tone, but my speaking voice never changed (though it wrecked my singing voice, which wasn't all that good anyway) and I never had acne (not complaining!) nor facial changes.   \nFor two months in late 2016 I quit T because my female side decided to take over, and it just felt wrong, I panicked. I started again because I was suffering without it. But when I restarted, the changes didn't return. Bottom growth did not continue, and even the hair growth didn't return, except for what remained from the first round of T. I had to quit T for a while for top-surgery, and I've been back on it for more than a month now, and I'm not feeling any of the relief effects of T that I initially had.  \nSo, has anyone had any similar experiences?", "date": "2018-10-14 22:49:30", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9o76d4/transmasculine_enby_regrowth_after_top_surgery/", "author": "CailanJade"}, {"title": "Dyed my hair and did my makeup, and I feel pretty good for once.", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-14 23:00:33", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9o79ac/dyed_my_hair_and_did_my_makeup_and_i_feel_pretty/", "author": "Kvanantw"}, {"title": "My femme v masc looks", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-15 01:38:24", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9o8dsq/my_femme_v_masc_looks/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Femme v masc vibes", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-15 01:52:59", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9o8hd4/femme_v_masc_vibes/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Femme v masc looks.. been wanting to share somewhere and I feel like this is the place", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-15 02:04:23", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9o8k9t/femme_v_masc_looks_been_wanting_to_share/", "author": "gsaeso"}, {"title": "[NSFW] [Might delete later] Getting dysphoric whenever I have sex", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-15 14:15:13", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9od1i3/nsfw_might_delete_later_getting_dysphoric/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "My voice has been changing very gradually on low dose T.

I've (AMAB 25) been unsure about my sexuality and gender identity since grade school  (played with my sister's toys as a kid because they had cool mechanics and was always frustrated that certain things that I thought were cool were pigeonholed as \"girly\"). I only really came to terms with my pansexuality a few years ago while dating a trans girl who, for the first few dates until she came out to me, passed very convincingly. It was then that I realized I didn't give two shits what someone identifies as or what parts they've got, as long as they're a good person.\n\nWhen I started dating my current GF, I was relieved to find out she was pan as well so no friction there! She began to express an interest in me crossdessing for her in bed sometimes, and I not-so-reluctantly agreed. I started to realize that - hey - I actually just plain enjoy *feeling* more femme once in a while, beyond just the sexual gratification for her and I. I had talked to her about these feelings almost a year ago and she was very accepting of it, but I had stressed that I was still confused about it. Fast forward to a couple months ago: I made a conscious decision to begin growing my hair out with the goal being shoulder length or just past, I began stealing my girlfriend's more andro clothing pieces like cardigans, sweatpants and jackets, but doing all of this without really acknowledging why it made me feel so cozy on the inside.\n\nA few weeks ago, I stumbled blindly into r/traaa from an askreddit thread and was curious about whether I was an \"egg\" or not. Found my way to egg_irl and while there would be a point here or there I would agree with for me, I didn't really feel \"called out\" by it like some do. Since then I did some serious thinking about my body and what these feelings mean to me and have come to the conclusion that I don't hate, nor do I love all my body's features. I realized that I've been frustrated with my giant Adam's apple for well over a decade, that I wish my hips were wider and my butt was bigger, that maybe having small breasts could be nice. BUT I also realized that i really appreciate my ability to grow an ok beard (babyfaced af until 22), I love my voice (deep and resonating, but still having big falsetto range for singing), and I realized that I cherish and love my penis to no end. Real sure of that one because if I take a break from my ADHD meds and go back on them I can't get a boner for like 2 or 3 days and it's SO FRUSTRATING.\n\nSo for a while I was confused because I genuinely feel a certain new happiness that I haven't felt before when I feel femme, but there is no dysphoria about feeling masc. So today I decided to say \"Fuck all this confusion, I'm gonna accept my feelings for how they are and express myself more fluidly\" And layed down with my girlfriend to tell her. She had some questions but it was all in the pursuit of greater understanding and she didn't even hesitate with accepting it (she's a social work student so she's brimming with compassion) and when we were done I cried a little and thanked her. I realized how good it felt to finally be able to say these things with confidence so I wanted to come share good feels with y'all.\n\n**TL;DR I did an NB bingo card today and was a hard yes on 21/25 and it feels great to be comfortable with a label for once.**", "date": "2018-10-18 00:09:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9p43t5/finally_feeling_comfortable_with_a_label/", "author": "Enby_D"}, {"title": "Oh... and hello. \ud83e\udd2d", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-18 01:09:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9p4jw5/oh_and_hello/", "author": "TheRazzLi"}, {"title": "Kids are sweet", "text": "I just wanted to share what my 7 year old said to me this morning after using my pronoun correctly:\n\n\"I would not could not call you he,\nI would not could not call you she\"\n\n\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc95\n", "date": "2018-10-18 01:19:01", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9p4mef/kids_are_sweet/", "author": "oshyponz"}, {"title": "Looking for advice on distinguishing presentation from identity", "text": "TLDR in title.  For background, I'm AMAB and for the last 2+ years I identified as female, now I have no idea what I am (other than not male).  More detailed story/rant below.  I'm mainly looking for \"what questions should I be asking myself?\" sort of advice since I know no one can just give me an answer.\n\nLong Rambling Story:\nI've never really liked dresses/skirts and always prefered jeans/t-shirts/polos and other gender neutral clothing, but always considered that more of a presentation/look thing than anything to do with my identity.  For my hair I grew it out so I'd look less like a guy but hated it down so I kept it up in a ponytail except to shower/sleep.\n\nA couple months ago I decided to try a bob cut because as I said I hated it long but I ended up feeling hugely dysphoric (like last male haircut I ever had dysphoric) but it was because it was way too feminine... not too masculine... and now I don't know what to think.  This is the first time I've ever felt flat out dysphoric because of looking too much like a girl... or maybe hating my long hair was the same and I just didn't realize it for what it was?\n\nNow I'm re-evaluating everything, everything I've done for transitioning has been \"okay it doesn't make me look like a guy, good enough\".  Voice, got it to the point where I stopped being called sir on the phone, good enough.  Keep working till I get ma'am-ed on the phone? Too much work.  Face?  I have pretty androgynous features, I can get gendered female without makeup/FFS, so I wont bother.  Breasts? I've got them, they're small but surgery seems like a lot of work for something cosmetic.  I thought I was just lazy/not as dedicated to passing as some but between that and the dysphoria now I'm wondering if I never felt like trying because I didn't want it.\n\nAll that has me wondering if I'm nonbinary.  But at the same time I had huge genital dysphoria and got bottom surgery and I've never had second thoughts about that.  I'm getting to the point where other than a couple of masculine features I'm working on I can look at myself naked in the mirror and see a woman... and that doesn't bother me, but at the same time hormones haven't erased my semi-masculine skeletal structure... so...

I'm pretty set on not wanting D.I. I don't want my nipples to be free grafted.\n\n I thought that meant my only option was t anchor, like a traditional reduction, but when I went to my consult my surgeon threw me off with mentioning buttonhole. I heard of it, but since this was an insurance provided surgeon I didn't think she'd be willing to do it. I knew she did D.I, Peri, and keyhole, along with breast reductions for cis women. I knew I wouldn't qualify for peri or keyhole, and intended to ask how flat I could get with t-anchor.\n\n She said, why bother with the extra scar, and said buttonhole seems right for me. I didn't know anything about buttonhole so I feel like I didn't ask any questions I wanted. She said that unless I get D.I. Any surgery I get won't leave me flat, because 1.) I'm big, \"C+ or D\" she said. I have a really small rib cage so they just look so overwhelming. 2.) \"my tissue is like coconut meat, so dense\" \ud83d\ude2d  3.) because of sagging my \"pedicle\" is really long (I lost around 10 pounds a year or so ago) and that has to go somewhere if I'm not going to get the nips cut off and re attached.\n\nIf I do buttonhole, I can get down to a B, but it'll still look like a female chest. This is really disheartening. I wanted to be able to take my shirt off at the beach... \n\nShe said a revision could be done later to lipo out any possible fat making them as small as possible, but couldn't guarantee they'd be much smaller.\n\nBreast feeding, as much as I hate the concept, is kind of important to me. I have a killer immune system bc of my mom, and I want to be able to pass that along. Sensation is also important to me. Right now they're so sensitive they hurt when touched, but I think after surgery it'll be just... Normal possibly.\n\nWhatever she asked (\"where do you want the fullness? Like regular female breast? Like gynecomastia? Where do you want your nipples? How wide?\") I couldn't answer. I just didn't know. Because I was expecting the possibility of flatter results.\n\nSo my questions are... I guess\n\nDid anyone get a reduction instead of complete flat?\n\nWhat the fuck does a b cup even look like??  I thought I was close to a b cup but apparently not, and the Internet is very... Generous I think (hope?) with what they call a b cup, and most of the images I find are from porn anyway so I can't consider it realistic. \n\nShould I compromise with what I want? She said I could always just get DI later if I couldn't stand having something even if they're small, but would another surgery leave me more messed up? Would I have less feeling if I did it twice? Or would I just have to worry about healing twice and just the inconvenience of it?\n\nIt's a lot, sorry!

Due, largely to culture, I think just about everybody has a folder in their brain called \"gender,\" and 2 sub-folders for male and female, which each contain all the cultural assumptions associated with those genders such as: \"What is typical behavior for this gender?\" (someone can behave gender atypically, but it gets noticed (a man wearing makeup is a man wearing makeup, but a woman wearing makeup is just a woman)).  People basically make a series of assumptions about someone based on their gender, until proven otherwise.    \n\n\nOne of these assumptions in particular, is that most people (even though many won't admit it) see and treat men as being more of a potential threat than women (until shown otherwise).  Single fathers are often assumed to be pedophiles or rapists based on nothing but being alone with a child, while this doesn't cross anyone's mind when you see a woman alone with a child.  If a woman compliments another woman, it's seen as being genuinely nice, but if a man compliments anyone the first assumption is that he's trying to fuck.  \n\n\nSo, when people don't fall easily into one of those 2 categories, I think people sort of mentally create a new gender for that person, but also people try to do this with the minimum amount of mental work possible, so generally people are sorted as either a modified version of male or a modified version of female.  I think on the deepest level, most people perceive people AMAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of male, and AFAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of female.  \n\n\nThe modifications I think people make are mostly surface level.  The aspects of gender that are more often consciously thought about are modified to be in line with the gender wants to be perceived as (at best, although often not even that much).  I think the way people perceive me, who think of me as a transwoman, essentially attach me to the \"male\" folder in their brain, but it's a modified version, where they are trying to perceive me as a woman, so they rebuild the whole concept of womanhood, as much as they can into a modified version the \"male\" folder.  So, basically, in every way they can consciously think about it, I'm seen as a woman, but in all the subconscious ways that people don't talk about or want to openly admit, I'm seen as a man.  \n\n\nSo, the sort of way that men are seen as a bit more of a threat, I have that notion attached to me.  This makes seeking female friends a lot more difficult.  I think generally cishet people combat this by generally make other cishet friends of the same gender, at least at first.  A heterosexual man can approach another heterosexual man for friendship, without being seen as a threat because there is a balance of power, and then eventually prove to each other, and by extension each other's friend groups to not be a threat, and potentially make female friends by extension.  In the same sort of way, women can approach other women, because they don't see each other as threats in the first place.  In essence, it's a bit easier to make friends of one's own gender.  \n\n\nThe thing is, I don't really have that.  I have to prove to women that I'm not threatening, and because I'm not above any of the psychology here, I kinda need men to prove to me that they aren't threatening, and when it comes to other transgender/nonbinary people I have to deal with some sort of combination of those 2 things.

I want to preface my post by saying that I grew up in a very conservative household. My parents are Russian and they don't believe in jomosexuality or in transgender people. Once I moved out I started exploring myself and my feelings more thoroughly. I knew I'm pansexual since puberty, but I have also been a tomboy since I was able to express my discomfort with dolls and everything with the colour pink. So since I moved out I have been experimenting with different kind of looks that I never could try out whilst living with my parents. I was not allowed to wear short dresses and didn't even think about binders and suits. But now I know that I feel very comfortable in boy mode. Of course I love to wear a dress once in while - they're comfortable as heck. \n\nHowever, I found the terms \"agender\" and \"non-binary\" on the internet and it seemed fitting. My parents would never know I identify as non binary and I don't have to come out, since I have always been kid of boyish and my language doesn't know any neutral pronouns. \n\nThat's the story up until a few months ago. I began to remember episodes from my childhood, where I denied being a girl and where I felt humiliated when I was considered such. I began to realize that there is a reason I hate my breasts and therefore I should seek treatment, which wasn't easy to get in my city. The only help I received was a therapist who didn't even specialise in gender and sexuality, but she tried helping me find my identity nonetheless. She made me realize, that I have no fucking idea who I am. Considering my upbringing I could be a scared ftm who is afraid of social stigmata and hate as well as be a non binary person. I have been lurking in this subreddit as well as over there at r/ftm and I see myself in posts of both subreddits. \n\nSo my question is, whether anybody here could help me find my peace regarding my gender. Is there anybody who felt similar and how did you find an answer? Is there such a thing as \"identifying as both agender and male, but not being gendefluid\"? Are there any resources out there that I could read to get a better understanding of these issues? I know that my long term goal is transitioning. What I don't know is how far and what operations I want to get exactly. I'm afraid of T, but I am longing for top surgery. I am well aware that I need therapy, believe me, I'm on several waiting lists. The problem is that I am moving from city to city every few months to years and it is hard to find a therapist who would treat me longer than just a few months. If anybody is able to ease my mind until I get therapy, I would be very, very grateful. \n\nP.S. You are all lovely and beautiful people and it makes my day to look through the selfies posted here. Keep up the good spirit! I believe in you! \ud83d\udc95", "date": "2018-10-24 15:57:06", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r0wuw/who_even_am_i/", "author": "E__Nygma"}, {"title": "Recently shaved my head - it's so satisfying!", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 16:23:56", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r15rw/recently_shaved_my_head_its_so_satisfying/", "author": "woncepil"}, {"title": "I\u2019ve found the missing puzzle piece and I\u2019ve never been as happy as I am now.", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 16:45:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r1cwv/ive_found_the_missing_puzzle_piece_and_ive_never/", "author": "PeopleWarehouse"}, {"title": "Tasmania to be first Aussie state to remove gender on birth certificate", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 17:24:25", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r1pwk/tasmania_to_be_first_aussie_state_to_remove/", "author": "drewiepoodle"}, {"title": "HRC Releases FAQ on Supporting Transgender &amp; Non-Binary Students", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 17:33:53", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r1t11/hrc_releases_faq_on_supporting_transgender/", "author": "drewiepoodle"}, {"title": "Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People WILL NOT Be Erased", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 17:54:19", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r1zpy/transgender_and_gender_nonconforming_people_will/", "author": "drewiepoodle"}, {"title": "Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin in a tweet posted Tuesday criticized alleged efforts by the Trump administration to define the legal definition of sex under Title IX as the gender a person is born with.", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 17:57:08", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r20n7/birmingham_mayor_randall_woodfin_in_a_tweet/", "author": "drewiepoodle"}, {"title": "\"What's the point of being of dressing like a guy if you're on estrogen?\" Cause I want to, that's why", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 18:05:29", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r23ip/whats_the_point_of_being_of_dressing_like_a_guy/", "author": "SkulkingSkull"}, {"title": "I came out to my friends tonight with this helpful Venn Diagram I created", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-24 20:03:03", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r35rc/i_came_out_to_my_friends_tonight_with_this/", "author": "ARSeM"}, {"title": "Taking my first baby steps", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-25 00:16:34", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r59k7/taking_my_first_baby_steps/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "What are your Halloween plans?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-25 00:25:17", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r5bvc/what_are_your_halloween_plans/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Attention all transgender and non-binary individuals:", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-25 01:39:27", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r5vxe/attention_all_transgender_and_nonbinary/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "hi I'm Erica, new here, afab genderqueer...got my haircut and feeling really conflicted", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-25 01:58:22", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r6149/hi_im_erica_new_here_afab_genderqueergot_my/", "author": "homemaderedhead"}, {"title": "I love when I feel cute either way I present", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-25 03:05:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r6iwg/i_love_when_i_feel_cute_either_way_i_present/", "author": "lord-of-fail"}, {"title": "got my gender marker changed to X AND took a super cute license pic!!!", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-25 04:38:59", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r75gj/got_my_gender_marker_changed_to_x_and_took_a/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Thought y\u2019all might appreciate my t-shirt today, and a sleepy bus enby on my way to get donuts with some friends", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-25 11:24:20", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9r9dv1/thought_yall_might_appreciate_my_tshirt_today_and/", "author": "BambiButch"}, {"title": "Hey, I'm Hunter, agender and new here.

Real life youtubers talking about their experiences would be amazing, but also I never see people like me in fiction either (except maybe female dwarfs in fantasy works), so that would be neat too...\n\nThe kind I'm looking for? People that present clashing gendered cues of the kind that show the influence of both testosteron and estrogen (for example, a beard, deep voice, breasts, and hips at the same time) with the person not trying to hide the testosterone/estrogen side. Honestly, my ideal physical state is more important to me than pronouns, so even a binary woman that decided to proudly show off her beard or a binary guy who had gynecomastia and didn't care to hide it would feel more representative than the \"no gendered characteristics displayed\" or the binary-passing kind of nb. Not to dismiss those kinds of nb, or call binary people like that any less binary! It's just that kind of physical presentation is rare but important to me. Of course human, nonbinary-identity rep of this kind would be even more amazing.\n\nNot to undervalue the nb representation that's been coming lately! Or nb youtubers! The rising positive/neutral representation lately is something I'm happy about, it's just not quite what I need, if that makes sense?

Growing up I always felt like I just did not quite fit in all the time.  Sometimes I felt girly and other times I wanted to be with the boys.  I was always somewhere in between and flowing back and forth feeling confused.  In the 70's and 80's I never heard of being non-binary or genderfluid.  Back than gender was very binary and there was no spectrum.  Internally I thought something was wrong with me.  Terms like, oh you are a Tom Boy were used at times but then I would be dressed up all frilly and playing with Barbies.  Nothing ever made sense.    \n\n\nIn college and the workforce, I felt conflicted and alienated because I wanted to fit in with the guys but was treated like I was \"just a woman\" and couldn't relate.  However I could relate to things they were talking about.  There was a part of me, that is masculine and it wanted to connect but kept being ignored and alienated because of the body I am in.  The feminine part of me was able to connect in ways that the other part of me never could and I could never find words to express or explain this.    \n\n\nI was not raised in a time where non-binary people were acknowledged and talked about.  There was no community to go to for answers and support.  I am 46 years old now and I feel whole and empowered to be me.  I am not confused and can look back and understand why I was struggling as I was growing up.  I am Non-Binary but never had the words nor definition to indentify as.  I do now.  I am no longer trying to fit in with the guys or the girls.   Gender isn't just binary and there is this great big beautiful spectrum and I am part of it!    \n\n\nAs  a parent, my transgender wife and I are making sure I kids know they will be supported and loved no matter what and know that gender isn't binary.

Since I came to college just over a year ago I\u2019ve been able to grow as a person and become more myself. A part of this process has been having a better understanding of my gender. Though I have identified as a man practically my entire life, I also felt like there was something off about the whole thing in my case. Thanks to a conversation I had with a friend who is also questioning their gender identity, I have been able to articulate this \u2018off-ness\u2019 better. I do feel like I am partially male, but at the same time this feels restrictive and not entirely accurate. There is also a part of me which I would say is either neutral, or without gender at all.\n\nThere are a lot of things that I want to try out (like becoming more androgynous in my appearance) but at the same time am really scared to do. Though my university is very progressive and accepting, the same cannot necessarily be said about the town I live in, unfortunately. At the same time, I do feel like a bit of an impostor at moments; as of now I\u2019m not even sure if I\u2019m really not just male, or if I am just making things up. There is also a part of me that wonders if I should even bother, given that this will cause me a lot of hassle in terms of incomprehension from the people around me. I also don\u2019t really have any dysphoria about my body, and I\u2019m pretty ok with people using male pronouns for me (though I also like the idea of neutral pronouns, and I also wouldn\u2019t mind if people used female ones). Even so, I feel like I would be happier if people\u2019s image of me was more in line with how I feel.\n\nSo, what do you think?

So now I\u2019m at this point where I\u2019m in awful pain daily I\u2019m 20 I\u2019m not living anymore and I can\u2019t do my fave things and my only option is a breast reduction because pain clinics turned me away for my age. \nI finally got my doctor to send me to a surgeon thank god I cried I was so happy when he agreed even if he didn\u2019t think they\u2019d see me without me jumping through hoops. Luckily the surgeon was extremely nice, she understood she examined me, she read my chart and saw my diagnosis, but she knew that I NEED a reduction for my health. So she was happy and glad to see me, she was glad I finally was in her office and was very genuine. Then they requested approval from my insurance. \n(I have a lawyer for my disability case rn btw) my lawyer told me it\u2019s VERY common for transmasculine people who NEED a breast reduction to be denied purely because of a gender dysphoria diagnosis because \u201ctop surgery is cosmetic and what if they\u2019re faking or exaggerating their pain to get top surgery\u201d and I kinda deflated.\nI decided hey maybe it won\u2019t be me because I have this long medical history of trying to fix it. Maybe just maybe I\u2019ll get this over with and be able to do things again. \nMy surgeons office put in a request for a double mastectomy, it got denied, which I kinda expected I\u2019m not heartbroken about because I don\u2019t solely identify as male so I\u2019d be fine with a reduction. \nBut I saw my surgeon over 2 months ago and they sent me off saying \u201cwe\u2019ll call you to set up a surgery date within the next month if all goes well.\u201d\nI called to ask about any updates from insurance and the person who wanted me to ask for her wasn\u2019t there, I\u2019m genuinely terrified I got denied something that might keep me alive (because my pain is severely worsening my mental health) because I am not cis. And I have no idea what to do. I can\u2019t hire a lawyer because I have no money.

This usually lead to me having crushes on lesbians more often than straight women.\n\nJust for context- I am a genetic male and the world sees me that way. I am okay that people call me cisgendered even if nonbinary may seem like a more accurate definition. I sometimes feel like I want to be a girl and other times I like being a guy. I am an attractive guy to others but I'm also a masculine guy. I don't find that masculinity attractive. I would love to look androgynous. I think who I am as a person is both a guy and a girl's mind. That mentality. I don't care whether the world accepts that or uses any specific pronoun. I just want to be happy with myself.\n\nMy presence here also has much to do with satisfying my curiosity. I love having a better understanding of why people feel and behave the way they do. Understanding others helps me better understand myself. In the past few months I've picked up an interest in researching quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and quantum physics. Everything is quantum. There is so much I don't know about the subject but I try to learn as much as I can because I strongly believe that it's only a matter of time before quantum computing becomes mainstream. And when quantum computing becomes mainstream people will stop thinking binary. Classical computing operates on a binary system. Which has worked great for a long time. When people feel that qbits are common sense they will have a better foundation for understanding complicated gender identities and sexualities.\n\nBinary thinking enforces this fallacy that if you aren't one thing then you are the opposite. That's a fallacy. If it isn't day time than it's nighttime completely disregards early morning and evening. Quantum physics makes it understandable that something can be YES and NO or 1 and 0 at the same time. When something is measured, it collapses into a state of 1 or 0. I encourage everyone, especially people who are interested in a more progressive world, to research this subject.\n\nIf you understand our universe, you will understand the humans in it and you will better understand yourself. You and I are the same. My right hand doesn't stab my left hand because it is different. Two parts of the same whole. Find someone who believes the opposite of you. Understanding someone who you disagree with will make you stronger and could possibly encourage them to better understand you. The right hand and the left hand can lift so much more together than they can independently of one another. \n\nI love reading about conservatives like Steven Crowder and Mark Rubio- not because I agree with them but because I disagree with them. I am a neutral person. It's hard for me to empathize with the right or left because I feel for both sides and wish both sides would aspire to be more tolerant of each other and better communicate with one another. \n\n\n", "date": "2018-11-01 13:11:25", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9t9a1b/feeling_complicated/", "author": "Fenccini"}, {"title": "Incubus", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-01 14:52:12", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9ta3je/incubus/", "author": "ChillaVen"}, {"title": "Halloween Outfit #FallOfCapitalism", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-01 15:02:33", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9ta6uy/halloween_outfit_fallofcapitalism/", "author": "Summerspeaker"}, {"title": "When you finally take a photo that doesn't want to make you hide in a deep dark pit of self loathing.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-01 15:21:18", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tacz4/when_you_finally_take_a_photo_that_doesnt_want_to/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "I have no idea what the Hell I was doing last night, but Happy Late Halloween my folks~", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-01 16:32:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tb0dy/i_have_no_idea_what_the_hell_i_was_doing_last/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "looked a little... witchy yesterday", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-01 19:27:28", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tclsp/looked_a_little_witchy_yesterday/", "author": "tearzah"}, {"title": "Halloween is easy when you already have a closet full of witchy clothes. \ud83d\udda4", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-01 19:36:32", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tcope/halloween_is_easy_when_you_already_have_a_closet/", "author": "Awffles"}, {"title": "Questioning if our identity is valid can be especially hard for folks living outside, across and between the binary.

I'm on 50mg of T cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4\" and 120lbs, pretty petite and very \"cute\" in a way that has people vastly underestimate my age. I am 29 and have never passed as male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips and smallish chest, and I'm starting out here with a figure that wont pass as male without some physical changes. My starting voice is pretty high and pretty Californian and if I try to throw it lower I just sound like ruby from steven universe lol.\n\nWhat I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy\n\nWhat I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever but I like my skin how it is so. Being smelly. Acne.\n\nAnyway so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 3 months on T+Fin.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHair:\n\n* No changes in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten thicker/darker, nor has more of it appeared.\n* No facial hair at all.\n* I feel like my head hair is thinner? Which it really shouldn't be... so I'm thinking it's just psychological or because I've bleached it too much lately. I have really thin and fine hair to begin with. My hair is not my glory lol.\n* I haven't noticed a change in hairline, but I started with a pretty masculine hairline to begin with.\n\nVoice\n\n* I don't think my speaking voice has changed as no one has commented on it, but I can definitely sing several notes lower than I ever could before. So whatever changes there have been a gradual thing, no cracking, nothing sudden.\n\nBody:\n\n* I have noticeably larger arm muscles. I can feel them even when I am not flexing.\n* No bottom growth (I think?)\n* Period is regular.\n* Maybe libido increased a little? Nothing really dramatic. Some people on T say you get dramatic orgasms lol. This hasn't happened. I am ace and started with a low libido though.\n* I don't know if I've had any changes in body shape. My pants fit the same. Maybe my shoulders have more muscle, but that I think is all if anything.\n* Body smell hasn't changed. Pee smell maybe? But it isn't dramatically noticeable.\n* Yeah pimples :( But I have struggled with them as an adult so much that I have been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for the first month or two but ran out a few weeks ago and the pimples have come back nooo but so far have been manageable.\n* No changes in hands or feet.\n* Face looks the same I think.\n* Skin feels the same.\n* Energy level is the same.\n* Appetite is the same.\n* A lot warmer, sweat more easily, get cold less.\n\nMental:\n\n* I haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or emotionally.\n* I think I'm a little sleepier. I was really sleepy the first week but now it's leveled out, although when I hit my bedtime I'm really ready to sleep.\n\nSo I thiiiiink that's all I really have to say...\n\n**TL;DR runs warmer, better arm muscles, can sing lower notes, no other significant changes yet.**\n\nI will try to post an update again in a few months.\n\nIf you have any questions, you can ask, though I don't really have much more to add.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-11-02 03:20:13", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tgiiw/3_months_on_testosterone_and_finasteride_and/", "author": "CalicoSparrow"}, {"title": "Susie from The Chilling Adventures if Sabrina is the definition of nonbinary cutie", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-02 04:07:55", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9tgu49/susie_from_the_chilling_adventures_if_sabrina_is/", "author": "i_miss_outer_space"}, {"title": "That old salvation myth", "text": "Lately the self-doubt has become so overwhelming that even hearing my own chosen name and correct pronouns feels like a knife to my skull.

Same for new clothes, new cosmetics, new hairstyles. Whatever. I can patch the surface, but I still don't know how to reckon with my pain. I still don't trust myself enough to trust another person to help me deal with the damage I've done myself and the damages others have done me.

Someday I'll know exactly what to do, and be confident, attractive, articulate, generous, and driven. Above all, I'll be present and dynamic, not like I am now*. The day is never coming. Zombie Jesus isn't on his way, and neither is my transcendent self. The substance of my body is the best I've got, I'm wasting my short-ass life, and I don't actually have a clue how to change for the better. I've gotten to the point of convincing myself it'd be smarter to live as my assigned gender, simply because trying to figure gender out has led me so deep into a morass of purposelessness and emotional sludge. All the little things that are better, I tell myself, are stupid, because they don't fix the big things. I know it's fallacious thinking \u2014 that an eyeshadow palette isn't worth trying out because it won't heal me from an abusive relationship, that I can't wear those jeans to that occasion because I'll still be too scared of my own shadow to post pictures of myself online, etc., etc. \u2014 but I still can't get out of the disgusting, pseudo-Christian worldview that it's okay to stay miserable and not make anything of this life, because eventually I'll get a better one. I hate this myth. I'm still hung up on it. I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else get feelings like? What do you tell yourself?

The label of \"woman\" always felt weird to me, almost as much as \"man\". I'm happy with she/her pronouns but in the last few weeks I started asking some friends to use they/them and it feels very comfortable as well.

During the last couple of months, I started to meet more femme presenting non binary friends of any AGAB. I came to realize that I identify with them a lot more than most trans women I know. Thinking of myself outside the binary simply feels a lot more freeing. So yeah, my objectives for my transition haven't changed much, I'm still working towards the same goals for my medical transition, I'm getting my legal gender changed to \"female\" because it's the best approximation I can get but I feel I have a better understanding of myself.\n\nAll that rambling to say,\n\nHi, I'm Alice, I can't write anything concise and I'm non binary.

I identify as trans and have never felt so comfortable and accepted with anyone as I do\nwith them and I hope I can make them feel the same way. \n\nRecently, they\u2019ve been going through some rough times with finding clothes that feel right and comfortable to them. One night, they had gone through their closet and filled up trash bags full of clothes, leaving their closet scant with clothes. After that day, they\u2019ve struggled trying to find clothes for the day and even got so frustrated and upset that they started tearing up and turning red, not knowing what to do. It feels as though dysphoria is what they\u2019re feeling. \n\nI am not very good with words, and I don\u2019t know how to help them when they\u2019re standing in front of their closet, obviously upset and tired and frustrated. Every time we\u2019ve gone shopping, they didn\u2019t seem so inclined to look for their clothes and I think it might be because of the mere fact that I\u2019m there and/or because they\u2019re tired of finding clothes and feeling disappointed and even more frustrated when it doesn\u2019t feel good when they try it on. They\u2019ve tried some online shopping from what I can see and have returned most things or kept them thrown in the corner of the closet, never to be seen again.\n\nI have felt a small bit of what it is like for them before I transitioned. Standing in front of my closet, not liking a single piece of clothing because it wasn\u2019t what I wanted and was too feminine and made me feel rather dysphoric. I still have some days where my dysphoria gets bad, but with winter clothes and puffy jackets, that\u2019s been less of an issue for me. The clothes I had before didn\u2019t align with my gender identity, which is where a lot of my dysphoria also came from, but I felt all that mostly disappear when I began to transition and bought new clothes for myself. I\u2019ve tried putting myself in that position again, so I can see how I can best help, but I don\u2019t know what I would\u2019ve wanted someone to have done or say in that moment. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to help them and they don\u2019t know how I can help. I feel lost and upset not being able to do anything on the side, and I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019d be like for them. \n\nDoes anyone have any words of advice or any thoughts they keep in mind as they go through moments or days like these? Are there any actions or words that you\u2019ve personally felt helpful? \n\nI want to be of the best help I can to my partner, and any help would be appreciated! I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve covered the depth of the situation well, so if you have any questions about anything, I\u2019d like to answer to help provide any context.

I use my deadname and pronouns at work, but literally nowhere else, which is... eh. I don't like it, especially the name thing, it squicks me out being called that. But I've also been here for 10+ years, we're very bad at handling change here, and while my agency is really supportive of gay and lesbian folks, we have absolutely zero representation of any of the other letters in the acronym in our various support organizations, etc. My agency recently released (very positive and affirming) guidelines on how to treat trans employees correctly; I've been angsting about whether or not to at *least* come out about the name thing for 5+ years now. (I'm also very bad at coming out? Like, I've never bothered to tell anyone at work that I'm queer, I'm just like \"This is my girlfriend.\" Pretending everyone already knows something in order to minimize having to give awkward speeches or what have you is apparently kinda my thing.) \n\nI finally came out to friends/family/etc. as nb/butch last year, but for almost my whole life even before that, literally no one except work calls me by my deadname; even my parents call me by my preferred/actual name and pretty much always have, because it's got roots in a gender-neutral nickname my dad used to use when I was a baby. \n\nMy train to work was screwed up this morning, and I couldn't find my work phone in the depths of my bag, so I emailed my department head (who I usually don't get along with very well, but she's in the office before my boss and I) from my gmail to let her know I would be a few minutes late. \n\nI have a short automated signature on my civilian email that states my name (in the format First \"Preferred Name\" Last) and that my pronouns are they/them.

As I've grown as a person, become more accepting of others, and learned more and more terms, I've started wondering if maybe cis female isn't actually what I am. \n\nWhy I might be:\n\nI'm definitely more feminine than not, but being a girl has never been super important to me. In elementary school most, if not all my friends were boys. I rejected pink clothes, preferred \"boy toys\" like Transformers, and only asked for Barbies if they came with pets (I loved animals). I would toss the doll aside and play with the horse or dog instead. Sometimes I would use the Dolls as Pokemon trainers, but never played with them the way they were intended. \n\nMy mother called me a tomboy, but this has the connotation of being sporty and masculine. I never liked sports. I'm the only person of any gender in my immediate family who doesn't, and I never considered myself masculine. Maybe \"boyish\" when I was a child. But that only referred to my interests. I was a nerd. Nowadays geek and nerd are gender neutral, but when I was a kid, I was strange for not liking the things girls should like, and liking the things boys should like.\n\nMy name is feminine, but not the most girly sounding thing I've ever heard, and while I don't particularly like the sound of it, I do appreciate that I wasn't named Macy like my father wanted. My mom told me some of the names she wanted before she knew what sex I was. Tristan if I was a boy, and Cameron for either a boy or a girl. I prefer both of those over my own name. But I'm not sure if what I like is the masculinity/androgyny, or if they're just more pleasant sounding to me than my actual name.\n\nWhen I was in middle school, I would often imagine I was a girl dressed up as a boy, tricking everyone and only telling the people she trusted. I think I got this idea from the episode of Fairly Oddparents when Trixie disguises herself as a boy to hide the fact that she likes comic books. I thought the need to hide her interests was stupid, but found her ability to pass herself off as a boy very interesting. I had similar feelings about Mulan (actually, when I was *very* young, I didn't even realize the men didn't know she was a woman for most of the movie. Completely missed the main point lol).\n\nI never wanted to be a boy though. I never had any problem with my body other than the type of dissatisfaction that comes with weight gain from puberty. I realized early on that I wasn't straight, but gender stuff that wasn't cis confused me, and nonbinary gender confused me even more at first. \n\nBut the more I learned about nonbinary genders, the less confused I became. But the *more* confused I became about them in relation to myself. \n\nWhy I might not be:\n\nMany nonbinary people's stories sound something like \"I identified as ftm for a while and that was better than female, but I still hated it. And then I learned the word nonbinary and immediately started crying because everything fell into place.\"\n\nAs you can probably guess, this is not me. All the gender problems I've ever had have been pretty vague. A lot of it was probably internalized misogyny (I'm not like other girls) and some of it was probably internalized homophobia (boys like girls, but I like girls and I'm a girl?)\n\nI haven't found a term that fits me. I'm not agender or neutrois or anything like that. I'm definitely female-aligned if I'm nonbinary at all. The closest I've found is demigirl, but I hate how cutesie it sounds (and demiwoman is so many syllables), and I don't think the \"partially this, partially that\" idea works for me.\n\nJuxera is also close. But it's so uncommon it's hard to find Juxeras who have told their story so that I may compare myself to them.\n\nI'm torn between \"everyone should explore their gender identity at least once\" and \"even if I find out I'm not a cis woman, is it even worth it? Because I'd still be so close to female on the gender spectrum\"\n\nThis is mostly just me dumping my thoughts and feelings into the void.

I was born a girl, and throughout pretty much all of my life I\u2019ve \u201cidentified\u201d as one, probably because everyone told me that I was one and I didn\u2019t know that trans/nb people even existed. Recently in the past year or so I\u2019ve began to come to terms with my sexuality after developing a crush on a girl, however I also learned about gender identity, and how people can be neither male or female.\n\nI don\u2019t think that I have any \u201csense\u201d of gender. I don\u2019t really have a feeling of \u201cI am a girl\u201d or \u201cI am a boy\u201d, I just feel like \u201cme\u201d, and have felt like this growing up, even before I started questioning. I\u2019ve only talked to a few people (who are cis girls) about how I feel and they said they had a strong sense of gender. I don\u2019t think I do. \n\nI don\u2019t feel any significant dysphoria. I do feel a little strange/uncomfortable when people refer to me as \u201cshe\u201d or call me a girl. I\u2019m also not really a huge fan of my chest, but neither of these issues cause me any significant distress or upset, which makes me wonder if these issues are just kinda made up? However, the uncomfortable feeling I get when referred to as female especially seems pretty real, so this is a pretty good indicator that something\u2019s going on. I also like to refer to myself as a \u201cboy\u201d as a half-joke, as it feels less awkward than referring to myself as a \u201cgirl\u201d. I\u2019d quite like to have a deeper voice as well (I once got jealous of a female voice actor who could voice a male with a deep voice).\n\nI feel happy when I cut my hair short and I feel really happy and comfortable with shorter hair. I don\u2019t know if this is just personal preference though. My clothing is pretty androgynous (I wear \u201cwhatever\u201d and in formal occasions I feel a lot more \u201cmyself\u201d wearing a suit than a dress.

Too bad I'm a girl.\"\n\"Wow, meta [surgery] sounds amazing, I wish I could do that, too bad I'm a girl.\"\n\n31: Oh holy fuck I'm actually, literally, not a girl. \n31: I hate that 'genderqueer' is so political and 'nonbinary' defines itself by what it is not. I hate that self-referring as an androgyne or maverique makes people roll their eyes. I hate being called ma'am and the knowledge that everyone looks at me and sees a woman, despite a relatively androgynous build, haircut, and facial features. I hate being unhappy with my appearance despite hitting the andro-trans lottery, genetically [build wise]. \n\n32: I've socially transitioned. Changing my name helped align my external perception with my internal understanding of myself. I'm out as nonbinary everywhere, including work and family. Wearing \"women's\" clothes is still delightful, but makes me feel strange. Wearing \"men's\" clothes is more physically uncomfortable (I have hip issues) but feels better psychologically. Sometimes I hear my voice and cringe. Sometimes I hear my voice and and can admire it [and it must sound like me; that is my voice, after all]. I don't want top surgery, I don't think; my breasts are small enough to bind relatively comfortably and they make me feel sexy often enough. \n\nI've started using topical DHT and will be starting either subcut or IM T hopefully at the beginning of next month. I plan on low dose (to slow changes and monitor my reactions to them) and short-term (potentially several years, but not forever). I am most comfortable when not gendered publically, but if they're gonna say Sir or Ma'am, I'd prefer Sir. I'm admiring AMAB femmes as #goals, though I know I'm not interested enough in makeup or fashion to really shine like that. \n\nI just want it to be over already. I know being more publically androgynous will bring new challenges and increase the risk of physical danger, and I feel guilty at wanting any changes at all.

I'm a non binary trans man but saying that would need so much more explanation...\n\nWhat are your experiences? What do you tell people? \n\n I know I need to transition medically and I'm in the process of getting diagnosed so I can get T and top surgery. And maybe I am a man. I prefer to be called by male pronouns and I want a male name and the thought of people seeing me as a man feels awesome. People don't really see non binary people as another gender. They think it's only a political and social opinion. They don't understand that non binary people can have dysphoria.  And so many people still see non binary people as just wanting to be special snowflakes. Because of that being seen as non binary feels sort of invalidating (but it's better than woman).\n\n I know I am really feminine and saying I am non binary would give me the right to be feminine. And although I have male clothes and a binder and a short haircut and I am happy when I pass as male, I get dysphoric if I try to pass on purpose because I know I don't and I just look like a girl in drag. (And I have nothing against people wearing whatever they want but it's just how my dysphoria manifests itself). I'm afraid that if I tell people that I'm a man I would be pressured to try to pass all the time or wearing men's clothes that don't fit me at all or going to the men's room even if I'm scared and doing other man things that I would totally fail and just be ridiculed. I am afraid people wouldn't accept me as a man so saying I'm non binary would be some kind of defense for not getting hurt. Also I know some trans men who are quite binary and stealth and have known me when I still tried to be a woman and I feel that they would take it as an insult if I told them that I am a man too. It's like they can judge wether I'm a trans man or not because they know how it really is, when cis people just have to accept trans people because they have no idea what being trans really feels like.\n\nI also know that I have internalized transphobia and nonbinaryphobia and have been ashamed of my feelings for about 25 years. I know I often judge people who say they are non binary because of it.

I'm new here. \n\nSome time ago I bought a binder from gc2b. It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. \n\nSo recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. \n\nTurns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this? I feel confident it's not that there's anything wrong with the manufacture, I just have a wildly incompatible torso shape for binding, and am just looking for whatever options I can find to compensate for that. \n\nThanks in advance!

I'm afab, in my mid-20s, and this isn't my first time questioning myself. I guess I just need a place to vent where others might understand me. This might get lengthy so I apologize. \n\nI grew up as a \"tomboy\", being the youngest of 3 kids and the only girl. I looked up to my older brothers a lot and I wanted to be like them. Our mom was the type who encouraged us to like whatever we wanted; my brothers were never discouraged from liking dolls or Disney princesses and I was never discouraged from liking hot wheels or Batman. So I had more freedom of expression than other kids back then but I still picked up at an early age that I'd be excluded from some things for my gender, and I hated it. \n\nWhen I was 5-7, I was very adamant about my tomboyish ways. I didn't really have friends at school so my brothers were all I had and I tended to follow whatever they liked. I was really resentful of having girly things pushed on me like when our babysitter kept trying to make me be a princess and I just wanted to be something cool like a dragon. I even openly proclaimed that I wanted to be a boy to my family. \n\nAt age 8, I moved and actually started making friends with other girls my age at my new school. I became a bit more girly due to their influence. I loved sleepovers with my best friend and we'd play Barbies (which I previously hated) or pretend to be Powerpuff Girls or do other \"girl things\" and I liked it. But I still prided myself on being a \"tomboy\" and liking Dbz, action figures, etc. and Buttercup was my favourite lol. I was a mish-mash of a child I guess. \n\nI realize all these things are more about gender roles/stereotypes and don't necessarily point to someone being non-cis; I know cis girls can be tomboys or masculine but I feel that its still worth mentioning in this context because it still has to do with my relationship with gendered stuff. \n\nIn my teens, I started trying harder to be more girly. I realized I liked pink, girly things, and the feeling of being feminine. But, I was also kinda desperate to feel \"normal\" in some way because I didn't get a normal teen life, and in some ways regretted rejecting the \"girly princess\" experience as a little kid. I had to drop out of high school and I became isolated, having a social life only online for the most part. I was never treated as normal/pretty/popular/etc in school before then and just wanted a taste of that life in some way. I also supressed the fact I was Bi in order to feel more normal (and because I had a bad experience with a girl I liked).  I did genuinely like girly stuff and being feminine but I know I was also trying to overcompensate somewhat. \n\nI did come to accept my sexuality and got with first girlfriend at 17. She was a lot more masculine/butch leaning and seemed to expect me to fulfill the femme role I entered the relationship with. At first, I was okay with this, but after a while I felt kind of bothered about it. I still wanted the tomboy side I'd always had to be recognized, even if I liked girly stuff too. I felt like I was being forced into a restrictive role and I grew bitter of it. I tried talking to her about it but I ultimately just felt very unlistened to. \n\nSometime around all this, I learned the word \"androgynous\" when talking to my brother. I don't remember what the topic was, but I'd never heard the word before and asked what it meant. He gave me a very basic definition like \"being in between feminine and masculine\" but didn't really mention it being more of an appearance/aesthetic thing. It resonated with how I was feeling internally at the time. It was the first I ever heard a word describing a concept of something outside of strictly man/woman, I guess. \n\nAs my frustrations in my relationship grew, I started rejecting my femininity more and more. I got rid of all my pink stuff, cut my hair short, and started dressing more boyish. Meanwhile, I could tell my gf was unhappy with my identity crisis and changes about myself. She wanted to be the only \"butch\" and in charge of the relationship. We had plenty of other issues outside of that though, and eventually broke up after a year together. \n\nAfter getting over her, I started coming back around to feminity. I got into scene fashion so it was a sorta different kind of feminity this time around but still. It felt like I was free to be femme again because it was my choice rather than something being forced onto me. I also realized that dressing more \"flattering\" and wearing makeup gave me a confidence boost I needed when I felt down about being dumped. And I realized I was being pretty immature before, that feminity isn't bad or inferior. \n\nEverything was fine like this til around the time I was 20. I'm not sure what triggered it but I started questioning stuff again. I learned about \"genderqueer\" one day when revisiting the concept of androgyny in a Google search. There wasn't really many other terms out there like there are now but it was my first time learning about \"non binary\" identities (though the term wasn't nearly as common back then). I joined tumblr a little later and explored the genderqueer community on there a little but it really wasn't like how it is now; there was less information and acceptance and a larger presence of \"theres only 2 genders, special snowflakes reeee\" type discourse on there. \n\nNonetheless, I decided to toy around with being \"genderqueer\" for a while. I dressed in boys clothes again and played around with unisex haircuts and going by they/them (online at least). I also discovered that I had dysphoric feelings about my chest and reproductive system (not my genitals but the other stuff). I tried binding but it was probably unsafe/not good. I had a better attitude about feminity but think I still pushed it away from myself a bit too much in order to feel validated because the community at the time seemed a lot more strict on being androgynous and such if you wanted any chance of being taken seriously. \n\nWell this went on for about a year. At that point I started missing having long hair and certain other things about being a girl like female solidarity and wlw/sapphic feelings. The dysphoria I had about my body didn't stop but I came to figure that perhaps I was just a \"weird girl\" who didn't want boobs and stuff. And that if I was going to grow my hair out that I may as well be a cis girl because that's how everyone was gonna see me anyway. \n\nWhat finally cinched the deal for me was when I developed a crush on a friend who at the time identified as a straight cis male. I decided that if I wanted him to like me, I definitely had to give all that up and hide away that I was ever anything but a cis girl. I'm kinda ashamed to admit I did that to impress a guy but... I really liked him and figured I was already kinda letting go of all that anyway. \n\nI was open about being Bi from the beginning which he was totally fine with, and I actually didn't really hide my issues re: my chest in the beginning... which I could tell he was less fine with but still tried to be respectful of. But I never let on that I had been identifying as non-cis before. Admittedly it felt kinda bad early on that he wouldn't accept me any other way and that I was gonna have to never question myself again if I was with him. \n\nAfter a while though, I learned to shove those feelings further and further away and embrace being a fully cis girl who was strongly attached to my gender identity. I even learned to stop talking about my chest dysphoria and stop thinking about it as much but tbh it never really went away, I just started avoiding it better. The fact that I do genuinely love being feminine and girly, and can appreciate certain aspects of being a girl (female solidarity/empowerment, sapphic love, childhood memories of girlhood, etc) made it more palatable. \n\nWell it's been 5 long years now and me and my s/o are still together. A lot has changed. He started identifying as bi/pan about 2 years ago and just embraced it more as time has passed. He's also been expressive of his own gender issues though I'm not sure what he considers it (sounds like genderfluid to me but I don't want to force a label on him).  But I've just been still repressing those old feelings of mine. I haven't re-evaluated myself up until recently because I needed to learn to accept myself again. \n\nAnd that's where I am now I guess. In the past couple weeks I've given this a lot of thought. There is a part of me that indeed likes being a girl for the reasons I mentioned earlier but... there is still a part of me that wants to be something else too. I think what that \"something else\" is may be agender? I get into this mood where I'd like to present as a cute feminine \"boy\" but go by they/them pronouns; I guess a small part of this side of me feels like a boy too but more agender because I prefer they/them to he/him and don't really like any other male-gendered terms besides boy - not man, guy, dude, sir, etc. Of course even in my girl mode, I kinda just always liked \"girl\" over anything like woman, lady, etc too (really always hated \"ma'am\"). \n\nI've been doing some poking around and there is just so much more information and acceptance out there now than there was when I first went through this. There are more terms to choose from also and I think the one I've found that resonated with me best is \"demigirl\". Of course, I also just like \"non-binary\" or \"nb/enby\" as well as it's an umbrella term, I think. \n\nThe thing I'm struggling with is just feeling validated. Parts of me still like those aspects of being a girl and going by she/her and I still want that but I also want to explore to this other side of myself, go by they/them, and play around with my presentation sometimes. I guess I want to have my cake and eat it too and I don't know if that's fair or not?\n\nAbout my presentation, that's another thing I'm struggling with. I have very long hair down to my waist nowadays which took me forever to grow and I don't want to cut it. I'm quite attached to my hair and any time I have cut it short, I've ended up feeling very regretful (and it's always been more out of pressure to prove myself than actively wanting it). As tempted as it is to have a cute androgynous hairstyle, I know it'd be a mistake to cut my hair. Besides that, due to my hair texture, it becomes very unruly and hard to take care of when it's short and I've never been able to pull off the cute androgynous hairstyles I liked. It just seems like it'd be better/easier for me to hide my hair under a hat or get a cute boy wig for when I'm feeling this way. But wanting to keep my long hair at all makes me feel like a big faker. \n\nThere's also the fact that I still love being feminine and even in my agender moods, I just wanna be a cute feminine boy. I still love girly things and my favorite color is still pink and such. I wanna be able to present as a cute boy when I want but still let my long hair down and be a girl as well. Although even with my hair down, I wanna be clear it doesn't necessarily mean I'm feeling in \"girl mode\" but yeah. \n\nI wouldn't consider myself trans but I guess I'm wondering if it's appropriate if I don't consider myself cis either? If it's okay for me to be non-binary if I'm not fully rejecting my assigned gender? I just don't wanna be doing anything bad... I know more closed minded people will just call me a special snowflake or whatever anyway but I really don't wanna invade Nb spaces if it seems like I shouldn't be there. \n\nI also want to talk about my body issues a bit (might get mildly nsfw). Like I said, I dislike having boobs, even in my girliest of moods, they do nothing but annoy me and I would just rather not have them. Mine aren't so big to start with but they're enough to annoy me especially when Pms hormones are wreaking havoc and causing them to feel bigger and feel painful. I often wear bralettes because they smoosh my boobs down to a more preferable size and appearance and make them less noticeable. I also like looser shirts and sweaters because they hide them even further (and cuz they're comfier). I never wear normal bras, I can't stand them. I don't know of a good solution for this right now because the chances of me being able to get surgery probably aren't good and it is an invasive procedure and all... I would not miss them but I just don't know if I can do surgery. I kinda wanna look into binding but I have my own concerns about that too (if its safe long term, especially for someone with chronic pain flare ups in my ribs/chest/back plus I have sensory issues with things that are very tight). \n\nI am fine with my genitals and actually glad they're out of the way and stuff. But I have a lot of bitter resentment feelings about having ovaries and a uterus. I know most afab people don't like having periods, cis or not, but for me it goes a little further than that. I'm childfree and have tokophobia so I really hate the fact its something that can even happen to me. It makes me feel super gross. I also am very unlucky and suffer from awful period cramps, pms symptoms, and even ovulation pains and other things that are not only NOT worth it because I'm never gonna use this crap, but also a painful monthly reminder of my body being capable of my worst fears. \n\nFinally, I uhm, might be happy with my genitals in all other circumstances but the desire for a penis is there at times in certain horny fantasies I have. I don't know if that means anything or not but yeah?\n\nSo, I think that covers everything I wanted to say. I'm sorry this was such a long essay but thanks to anyone who read this and anyone that leaves a comment. I am just so confused right now. I have talked to my s/o about a lot of this and so far it seems like he's accepting and just wants me to be happy but I'm still having trouble accepting myself I guess. Like I'm fake or overthinking or whatever. \n\nPs- I'm currently deleriously sick w/ a cold so please excuse any bad writing.

I was AFAB and some of my secondary sexual characteristics are very noticeable. More often than not people defer to she/her pronouns regardless of how I am presenting. This typically doesn\u2019t particularly bother me and doesn\u2019t cause any dysphoria. It does always cheer me up when folks use he/him or they/them or use more masculine language when referring to me. A few years ago I went by they/them pronouns exclusively. While the people closest to me did attempt to make an adjustment it never really felt genuine and asking for people to stop using she/her almost felt insincere? If that makes sense. It would sometimes feel as if I was asking for something I didn\u2019t fully believe I needed. Nowadays I just roll with she/her but when asked what pronouns I prefer I find myself always hesitating to answer. I don\u2019t have any attachment or connection to she/her but answering \u201cI\u2019m good with whatever\u201d seems dismissive or even a bit snide? The last thing I want to do is treat pronouns as if they are something trivial. \n\nTo further complicate things I recently lost 90 pounds. While I am happy with my weight loss it accentuates parts of my body a lot more than before. I\u2019ve been getting unwanted attention and have felt so much more vulnerable. Before the weight loss I saw my body as something substantial and grounded. I felt strong and more secure in my space and gender identity. Now everything has shifted. I\u2019m trying to rebalance myself and reconnect with my body.

This led me to think about how I heard that gender is better defined as a spectrum inside a triangle (hence title, pls don't shoot):  \nSo let's imagine we have an image of a triangle with a gradient inside: Pink in one corner, which would be female, blue in another corner, which would be male, and white for nonbinary (in this case used as an umbrella term for any gender that would be an extreme different from male and female instead of the actual color gradient of our triangle) in the third corner. As genderfluidity is a thing we'll allow anyone to either mark a specific spot or an entire area.\n\nYou'd think cisgender would be on the tip of either male or female, right? What if we put the average cisgender person on about 75% instead of 100% into their corner? That would leave some space for people to be overly male/female. If that just means stereotypically male/female is open for interpretation, but consider that a large amount of the population is rather apathetic towards questioning their gender is such a way to begin with as they simply accept their gender is the one matching their sex as assigned at birth. Meanwhile (just as an example!) a transperson (who is not nonbinary) will initially what to go to their chosen gender's extreme is far as possible - way beyond the average cisperson of that gender - or until reaching a point where they have beaten their dysphoric feelings and can accept their \"new\" spot/area on our theoretical triangle.\n\nNext thing I was thinking about is where to place Agender and if I should at all. You could put them right in the middle because they'd be equally far away from all 3 extremes on our spectrum. But wouldn't they be placed more correctly outside the triangle, leaving a hole in that concept? Now if we consider that there are Agenderfluid people, who's area would be partially inside and partially the outside of the triangle I'm pretty much convinced that I can't describe gender on a 2D plane at all if we want the base to be a simply geometric shape. I wouldn't know where to place myself in what I thought up either.\n\n**TL;DR**: Gender is a spectrum, but too complicated to visually describe based on a simple two-dimensional geometric shape like a triangle, because there are people outside that triangle. The point I wanted to originally make is that the average is not the extreme of their gender because some people are perceived as \"overly male/female\".\n\n**PS**.: Wow this turned into quite a wall of text. I'd just like to clarify that I am merely overthinking an idea I got from reading various opinions online.

I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.\n\nI   only learnt relatively recently that most people don't know they are   dreaming during their dreams but I always do and always have. It's not   the same as a lucid dream because I've had those, they are regular dreams but I can control my actions and the environment to a degree.\n\nI   also dream of myself in 3rd person (I see my body in 3rd person like I   am watching myself in a movie). Occasionally I swap between 1st and  3rd  person at will.\n\nHere are some questions, I will reply to them below:\n\n1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?\n2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)\n3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?\n4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?\n5. Do you have \"super powers\" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)\n6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?\n7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?\n8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?\n9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?\n10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)\n\nMy answers:\n\n1. I always know I am dreaming.\n2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once \"possessed\" another person's body and controlled them.\n3. No, I don't feel anything.\n4. They are quite surreal.\n5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.\n6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.\n7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.\n8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.\n9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)\n10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

I'm new here, and I'm hoping to find some perspective on pronouns and see if anyone feels the way I do. \n\nI hate that people use any pronouns to refer to me. I strongly prefer my name be used instead of a pronoun if possible, but that's a big ask. Here's why pronouns bother me so much. \n\nIf someone uses \"she\" or \"he\":\nUgh, instant dysphoria. That's *wrong*. Just *viscerally wrong*. I'm *not that thing*. Great now I'm thinking about how and why that person thinks of me as being that gender, and falling down a dysphoric rabbit hole. Plz no. \n\nIf someone uses \"they\":\nOh god I feel so guilty and self centered for asking for that. Did I ask for that? Did they just assume? Oh fuck what *is* this person's model of my gender? Do they think I want to be a they? Do they think I have a gender? Fuck, dysphoria. \"They\" as a pronoun Means Things now and isn't just a null value. Plz. Plz no. \n\nThere's no right answer. I don't in any way begrudge anyone else their gender identity. I just wish it wasn't such a dominant paradigm that people expect *me* to have one. I **don't**. \n\nAt some point I was asking people to use \"they,\" but I'm not sure any more. I never had a preference for it so much as a dispreference for being thought of as gendered in any capacity. I want to be able to just opt out of gender. To leave that field blank. I thought \"they\" would be a good null entry. \n\nBut then I got more involved in the nb scene and found that many enbies *identify with* \"they.\" This is great for them. They've found an option that works for them. I don't begrudge it at all. But it does make \"they\" no longer work for me. Because now it's an Identity too, which is what I was trying to avoid. The issue isn't with enbies identifying with \"they,\" it's that we don't actually have a null value pronoun. \n\nThe thing that's causing the dysphoria isn't that the pronoun is wrong; they're all wrong. It's that it reminds me that this person, and all the other people I meet, have gendered models of me in their heads. To them, I'm *(insert gender here)* and that will always be wrong. I ultimately don't have much control over it, just like I don't have much control over my secondary sex characteristics, and that's horrifying to realize every time. \n\nSometimes this makes me feel really out of place, and like I don't belong even with my nb friends. Like I don't fit in any of the boxes, not even the box for people who don't fit in boxes. Maybe I'm not alone?

I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I'm also really really struggling. \n\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~\n\n\nOk so I'm here today because I'm really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.\n\n\nI'm just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It's not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have \"phantom dick\" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It's like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.\n\n\n\nYou may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I'd have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That's one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.\n\n\nThis leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It's taking a big toll on me. I'm technically out, but I'm scared of being visible in any way. Right now I appear like a masculine girl I suppose, so I haven't had to say much about my gender outside of my small social circle. All of this, the dysphoria and the hate, has led me to despair\n\n\nI will never be able to live my truth. Hatred is everywhere. Dysphoria is atypical and I can't deal with it anymore. I am tired of being viewed as a joke and I'm tired of feeling I will never be free of dysphoria. I am worried. I have found over the last two years that I'm experiencing something that may be some kind of dissociation : periodically it feels as if I am not in the physical world, that nothing is real. It randomly feels like my clothes go missing so I have to touch my legs to make sure my pants are still there. Sounds silly but it is very distressing. Sometimes i can't feel the ground, it's like I'm on clouds. I'm not sure if this is related to my dysphoria and depression but it may be. I feel like i am going crazy.\n\n\nYes I am on the waiting list to see therapists. It is just a waiting game now\n\n\nSo I'm asking for advice. Particularly from trans masculine people in similar situations, though all support helps. Also please hold off the hate comments and PM's. I had someone from here message me telling me to kill myself for being nonbinary. That didn't help at all.\n\n\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this?\n\n\nHow do I deal with the hate?\n\n\nHow can I deal with dysphoria in non medical ways?\n\n\nI'm becoming filled with despair and having many thoughts of just ending it all\n\n\nThank you", "date": "2018-11-19 22:31:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/9ylrlj/nonbinary_dysphoria_and_depression/", "author": "waterpanne"}, {"title": "This is my favorite subreddit ever and y\u2019all are beautiful.

I recently came out to my family and some of my friends as bisexual. It\u2019s been really great, I feel like I can finally be myself and coming out to them was definitely worth the initial anxiety over what might happen. \n\nInterestingly, one of the things I\u2019ve felt has been the most freeing about coming out has been this feeling that I don\u2019t have to conform to being a traditionally feminine woman anymore, I cut my long hair down to a short bob and I\u2019ve been wearing more masculine or androgynous clothing and I feel really amazing doing so.  I went to conservative catholic schools all through K-12, and my parents would pressure me to dress \u201cmore feminine\u201d when I wore things like Doc Martens and t-shirts, and I subsequently went through several hyper-feminine phases but I never really felt totally comfortable wearing things like short girly dresses, but I always thought it was because I wasn\u2019t \u201cfinding the right color\u201d or \u201cfinding the right fit for my body type\u201d, etc rather than thinking maybe I just wasn\u2019t comfortable dressing that way altogether.  \n\nThe fact allowing myself to deviate from traditionally female expectations has felt so good has made me question whether I was repressing a desire to do this for some time, and maybe whether this could be indicative of perhaps being somewhere in the realm of non-binary?  When I started thinking this, sometimes I feel like maybe I fit somewhere in between non-binary and being a woman.  Pretty much for the first time ever (I normally really like my T&amp;A lol) I was wearing a baggy shirt and kind of felt like I wanted smaller boobs or just flatness.  Lately I feel like I sometimes want to bounce back between non-binary and woman, but I\u2019ve never felt this way before or questioned my gender prior to coming out, so it makes me feel more confused.  I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just because it\u2019s the first time in my life I\u2019ve dressed not traditionally feminine or if maybe I really do feel like I could have a different gender identity other than just woman. \n\nI know that gender expression is different than gender identity, but I\u2019ve been wondering if maybe it isn\u2019t so much the new clothes that feel great, but maybe wearing things that align more with how i might identify internally, but I start to get really confused when I think too much about it though because I think then we\u2019ll gender is a social construct and there\u2019s nothing inherently in our biology that dictates what clothes we should wear...etc. \n\nI guess I\u2019m very early on this journey of figuring out what\u2019s going on inside and learning more about myself, and I\u2019m just wondering did anyone have similar experiences?  Is there a word for this feeling?  What did you learn as a result of your soul-searching?  Is it normal to not at all question your gender identity until learning what non-binary was? \n\nThanks in advance everyone! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9a\n\nTLDR: Not sure if I\u2019m questioning my gender identity or simply gender expression since coming out as bisexual, looking for folks who had similar experiences or perspectives on what they ended up figuring out.

I just didn't care about what was for boys and what was for girls, I did what I wanted. That said, I've always presented very feminine and prefer to wear skirts (pants are evil). My main beef with my AFAB has always been 1. My uterus, i hate that thing so much 2. That my genitalia should determine how I act and feel. \n\nFor the most part, I am comfortable with my sex (the physical characteristics) but my gender does not line up with that sex. I mostly blame a binaty culture for this. If I could be a female sexed person in an androgynous role within society (that everyone accepted and understood that my physical characteristics did not determine my internal gender), that would be my dream.\n\nNow that I' taking steps to look more androgynous, I sat down with my husband to revisit my gender. We've been talking about it regularly to make sure we're on the same page. After talking through the above info he mentioned that he would support me through this but would always see me as a girl who wasn't a \"girl\". \n\nI honestly just don't know how to feel. Part of me is worried that I really am a girl playing at being agender. Another part of me wishes I was a sexless genderless being so I didn't have to deal with thia crap.

When I think things like \u201cwell I don\u2019t enjoy womanhood\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s hard for me to feel like and relate to depictions of women in media\u201d, it makes a little voice in my head say, do you really think that all dis and trans women have a mystical innate enjoyment of everything that goes along with being a girl? \n\nI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to separate my gender feelings from misogyny feelings. I don\u2019t know if sometimes existing in the way I do is uncomfortable because existing as a woman in current day society fucking sucks or I\u2019m you know, perhaps not as much of a girl as I thought. \n\nLike there\u2019s nothing that really defines being a woman and it can mean so many things to different people from different cultures and places so like my shtick might just be a part of that - stuff like hating shaving body hair, long hair, tight gauzy clothing, bras that show and cling to the shape of my new and dreadful D cups, like that is all stuff that a woman could also dislike.\n\nI would also feel a lot of guilt if I stopped IDing as a woman because I\u2019ve spent my whole life fighting to prove that women can be crush it in a STEM major, can crush it in comedy and don\u2019t have to be feminine. I was happy identifying as a butch lesbian for the longest time because I thought it spoke to my experiences of alienation from my straight peers and what society expects women to act like and be. But my partner no longer identifies as a woman so it seems I doesn\u2019t really fit the description anymore. Before them, I had boyfriend who was straight but I don\u2019t know if I wasn\u2019t really feeling our relationship because I dislike guys or because I dislike the idea of being a guy\u2019s girlfriend and being treated as such. I love my partner no matter what, so it\u2019s no big deal. But I don\u2019t know what my own sexuality is apart from probably not cis men.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated to me because I feel that if I said I was NB, I\u2019d just be copying them to deal with the fact I can\u2019t in good faith call myself a lesbian anymore. It feels somehow facetious to me to be like \u201cOh yes I am nonbinary, because I don\u2019t fit extreme and ridiculous gender stereotypes about women but I will never tell that to other people because I am deeply scared.\u201d I\u2019d feel like such a faker and a phoney to compare my experiences to that of other members of the trans community I know who have had such a hard time in their inner and professional lives due to actual transphobia. I\u2019ve been bullied for being not living up to expectations of women in my adult life, but I had a girlhood and teenhood that was pretty unscathed apart from internalized homophobia because I was so repressed that no-one, not even me, knew I was gay. And like I - did - have a childhood of a girl that was really impacted by sexism but also by growing up as a girl, so take that as you will. \n\nI keep having these thoughts that I wouldn\u2019t judge anyone else by but for myself I\u2019m like: \n\nThe medical, social, and governmental hoops would make your personal and professional lives hell, so you\u2019re better off staying where you are. You have no idea if this will make it better. \n\nPeople go to great extremes to be seen as their real, internal gender so if you are this hesitant about it, it probably isn\u2019t real.\n\nYou are an extremely timid person who bursts into tears easily, if the world perceived you as a man other people would absolutely not tolerate you - you would be destroyed. \n\nMy parents are already extremely unsupportive of me being gay, and I know they won\u2019t \u201cget it\u201d Or respect me if I say I\u2019m gender neutral. If I ever pursued biomedical transition (which I\u2019m not sure if I want or not) they will flip out and have a extreme transphobia heart attack. As silly as it is, I love my parents deeply and look to their guidance and often their financial support and I don\u2019t want to lose them when they\u2019ve sacrificed so much for me. My extended family will not be supportive either.

After I moved to a very progressive university in a diverse city, I came out as a lesbian, cut my hair short, started attending an affirming church, and began to address some of my mental health issues.

Suddenly, it felt like I was subverting traditional gender roles by expressing myself that way, and I really liked that feeling. However, something still feels off. When I'm with my girlfriend or close friends, I generally feel okay with my gender expression, but when I'm in public, I'm acutely aware of how my femme presentation and naturally curvy figure read to everyone else. I've tried dressing in a more androgynous way, but that doesn't feel right, either. I am very uncomfortable with my bust and hips, but I have a hard time teasing out how much of that is dysphoria as opposed to the typical body image issues most binary women face.

So far, I've had one VERY minor voice drop and nothing else as far as any of those changes go. \nI knew to expect other changes though, and that I couldn't pick and choose them. Even so, I was willing to deal with things I didn't want to deal with severe voice dysphoria. I was always fairly hairy pre-T, and very content with the amount of body hair I had. I had a MAJOR increase in growth almost immediately, and after awhile, I had so much hair that it caused dysphoria, but if I shaved, I also got dysphoria. There's a brief window of time between shaving and full growth where I'm comfortable though. Facial hair? Started growing it by about 2 1/2 months, and usually have to shave daily now. Hate it. Huge source of- you guessed it, dysphoria. I was neutral on bottom growth until about 8 or 9 months in, and out of nowhere, I started hating it too. I'd be willing to accept all of these things if my voice would actually fucking change, but it won't. My T levels are comfortably in the male ranges but not too high, and have been since very early on, not to mention I believe I was told in the past that I have naturally high testosterone levels for someone afab. It really seems like the only positive thing I got out of this whole mess was the end to my monthly cycle (I had one maybe 3 or 4 days after I started T, and that was the last one Ive had). Im desperate for my voice to change but everything else is making me miserable. I'm debating stopping in 6 months at my next appointment, but I really don't know what to do. I look and sound exactly like a somewhat hairier, acne covered version of my pre-T self and it's incredibly discouraging. \n\nAnother issue is my chest and bottom dysphoria. I'm so poor and my efforts at crowdfunding have been pathetic, so I don't see myself reasonanly affording top surgery for another 3-5 years. My family is poor too, so there's no chance of someone else paying for it. \nMy bottom dysphoria is a confusing and complicated beast on it's own. I absolutely cannot stand my natal junk, but the idea of having a dick is only slightly better. Both cause me massive amounts of dysphoria. Honestly of metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, phallo is the one that I'd be most comfortable with, but even it just feels so wrong to me. I'm never going to be happy unless I quite literally have no genitals, and I'm not entirely sure that's possible right now, or ever in my lifetime.\n\nI dunno,\nit just feels like there's no way out of all of this and I have no idea what to do anymore.", "date": "2018-11-26 02:11:26", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a0ezt0/seemingly_incurable_dysphoria_venting_mostly/", "author": "nicotinedaydream"}, {"title": "Finally put into words how I feel", "text": "Hi all,\n\nI've been grappling with my own identity for about 16 months now (well really my whole life) and I've finally put into writing how I see myself.

With this in mind, expressing myself exclusively as a male moving forward will be a case of me not being true to myself - being male is just what biology gave me in terms of anatomy, and my mind and soul can't really be categorized.

English is not my first language, so please correct me if I use any wrong terminology!\n\nThe other day, my office had a trans-nonbinary person come in for a workplace sensitivity training type thing. Which was honestly pretty awesome and I'm glad they did. But one of the first exercise they did was go around the room and ask for people's pronouns. Immediately, I started panicking at the thought of having to identify my pronouns.\n\nBasically at this point in my life, I don't know if I'm cis. I might end up being so, but I'm not comfortable labelling myself as such right now. I'm AFAB, almost always presented as femme-ish at work and in my social life, and it's more likely than not people will assume I'm a cis female. However, I've never been comfortable with... I guess, straight up labelling myself as female in front of others. It feels like I'm shutting out parts of me that I don't really know how to identify right now. I have usually worn feminine clothes, mostly because of size and availability (I'm 4'11 and tiny). I have no problem with people referring to me as she / her. But at the same time, during my teen years all I wore were boy's clothes, since it was an option before breasts and butts were a thing. I didn't mind it when people who didn't know me referred to me as he / him during that point in my life. I want a penis sometimes, but I also want to be able to keep my vagina / boobs (Think Ranma 1/2 if you're familiar with anime).\n\nSo basically, I really don't have a preference for what pronouns people use for me. It makes me a little happy when people accidentally refer to me as \"he/him\" or \"they/them\", mostly because I feel like a neglected part of me is getting recognized. But I don't feel dysphoric when people assume I'm female either. I'm not trying to be dismissive, but I just... don't care for gender.\n\nBut during this presentation, the thought of having to identify myself with a pronoun in front of my co-workers nearly gave me a full blown panic attack. Thankfully they didn't get to me and moved on with the presentation, but I was so scared. Later in the presentation, the presenter talked about how if you say you don't care about your pronouns, you're being dismissive of gender minorities, and you're likely relying on your privilege of being assumed to be a gender you are comfortable with. Which makes sense, but it made me want to disappear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo right now I just feel confused and crappy. Is it wrong that I didn't want to identify a pronoun? I just want people to choose what feels natural to them. Am I taking advantage of my privilege? Do I need to feel dysphoric to not be a cis person? I don't know what I am yet, but I'm scared that what feels natural to me is hurtful and offensive to many.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-11-28 09:22:52", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a14o0e/im_confused_about_my_gender_my_pronouns_everything/", "author": "Junior_Fondant"}, {"title": "Videogames that allow they/them pronouns?", "text": "I have recently been playing Pyre by Supergiant Games and there is something sooooo validating/gender euphoria-y about being able to set your character's pronouns to they/them at the start of the game (though you can reselect at will) and then it's just used throughout consistently by all other characters without it ever affecting anything.

At various stages of my life, I have engaged in deep soul searching about my gender identity. I don't identify as a traditional man, and I would love to express feminine behaviors more freely, but I also don't feel like a woman trapped in a man's body. \n\nIn previous years, when I researched these topics, it seemed as if there were only two options: male or female. I thought quite seriously about whether or not my feelings warranted some sort of transition, and have always concluded that full transition is not the answer for me. I'm trying to figure out some other path. \n\nIn recent years, I have been incredibly inspired by the ways that young people have pushed the boundaries of gender. My heart swells with pride when I hear trans-identified students talking about the experience of legally changing their names or beginning hormone therapy. It is so incredibly cool to see more and more representations of non-traditional gender identity emerging in popular culture. \n\nI have been thinking about the possibility of beginning to express more gender variance in my daily life, but I'm also worried about heading down a path that would blow up my life and my family. My wife and I are very close, she has always known that I'm bi, and she is very supportive of the entire LGBTQ alphabet when it comes to our friends, colleagues, and students. That's not quite the same thing as her dealing with the fact that her husband is identifying as non-binary or gender fluid. \n\nIt is exciting and encouraging to read stories about younger people making this journey; it is much more difficult to find these stories about older people. The few stories that I've found on Reddit so far have been pretty negative. I stumbled across some weird subreddit where \\*everyone\\* seemed to be hostile to non-binary and gender fluid identities, and it was very disheartening. One woman -- who sounded like a really kind and compassionate person otherwise -- basically said \"I live in fear of the thought that my loving, long-haired somewhat feminine husband might tell me he is non-binary because that would the end of everything.\" \n\nBut I've also come across many anecdotes which talk about people becoming completely wrapped up in their new identity when they come out as non-binary, gender fluid, or transgender. Spouses report feeling incredibly left out and excluded when their mate begins articulating a new gender identity, and it sounds like people who are transitioning/emerging sometimes become narcissistically focused on their personal journeys in ways that end up carelessly hurting those who love them. \n\nIt would be incredibly helpful to learn more about examples of human beings who have managed to emerge as non-binary later in life without destroying their marriages in the process. I'm also interested in hearing about incremental, less dramatic ways that people have gradually started pushing the envelope of their gender expression. \n\n\\++++\n\nI feel like there is a facet of my personality which has always struggled to be expressed. It's an important part of me, but it's not the only part of me, and I wouldn't want to ruin my marriage over it. At the same time, when I see growing acceptance of non-traditional gender identities, I feel like there might be a pathway that could work. Whether I'm talking to a student who now identifies as male talking about his paperwork going through or I see the introduction of a transgender character on a CW show (three cheers for Nicole Maines!), I feel actual butterflies.\n\nIt's all very confusing and exciting, but I am trying to keep it all in perspective and not make any hasty decisions.

In my early 20s (I\u2019m now 26) I considered myself very feminine, had long hair and wore these amazing 50s style swing dresses which was a lot of fun (you get so many random compliments if you wear a big poofy dress with underskirt out in public).\n\nOver the past few years I\u2019ve phased makeup out of my routine and started dressing for comfort and to express my queerness. I\u2019m in a happy LTR with a straight guy who loves me and affirms my sexuality, but I often feel erased by outside parties when not actively dating or seeking women. I leaned hard into the short hair/plaid shirts/singular earring aesthetic and experienced what I can only describe as gender euphoria for the first time.\n\n...Which leads on to my first major DYSphoric experience. I had to find an outfit for a friend\u2019s \u201csummer\u201d wedding on limited time and budget. I don\u2019t know shit all about fashion or formal wear and needed something smart but seasonally appropriate that also wasn\u2019t too feminine. The stress of outfit hunting and the invalidation in going around women\u2019s clothing stores and finding only clothes that were too delicate and femme for my presentation and (broad, plus size) bodytype threw me into a gender panic. I had a mini-melt down at work where I suddenly felt intensely like my gender was wrong, that everyone else\u2019s perception of my gender was wrong...I felt physically light headed and queasy, it was like being hit with a bat.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve noticed a torrent of little things like the fact that I don\u2019t mind family and close friends viewing me as female, but I feel deeply uncomfortable when people I come into contact with through my work, or store assistants in other businesses etc \u201cassume\u201d my gender and \u201ctreat me like a woman\u201d. I\u2019ve asked for male uniform items at work and feel I\u2019m more comfortable, and I feel invalidated when I share selfies only for friends to make comments about me being \u201cpretty\u201d. (They\u2019re only being nice, but I feel like I\u2019 m fairly visibly trying to present masculinely so it feels like they\u2019re forcing themselves to say it because \u201csurely it\u2019s what girls want to hear\u201d).\n\nI don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m meant to be feeling or looking for. I might just be a masculine-of-centre cis woman whose dysphoria comes not from any discomfort with being female, but from society expecting me to look/feel/be a certain way because of that. Or I could be enby, but it\u2019s so hard as a female queer woman to separate what signs are my soul trying to tell me \u201cthis is the shape of my gender\u201d and what\u2019s just society/my conditioning trying to force something different on me than what I am.\n\nThis entire post is a mess but I guess that\u2019s accurate to where my head\u2019s at right now... If this is too big a mess to pick through I guess I have some more straightforward questions:\n\n1) Can you be Enby and still favour the pronouns you\u2019ve known your whole life? I\u2019ve experimented a little with \u201cthey\u201d but \u201cshe\u201d feels most personal to me despite the fact I don\u2019t like being \u201ctreated\u201d as female.\n\n2) What were your personal journeys like when it came to untangling your identity? Did you just \u201cknow\u201d, or is it common not being able to unpick what\u2019s \u201cyou\u201d and what\u2019s just discomfort with society\u2019s binary idea of gender?", "date": "2018-11-29 11:27:22", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a1gjfo/possibly_enby_butch_bi_questions_everything_long/", "author": "lessthanmetal"}, {"title": "I love this sweater so much.", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-29 14:43:33", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a1hwlw/i_love_this_sweater_so_much/", "author": "q3w3e3"}, {"title": "sometimes i'm not sure if nonbinary is a gender or lack thereof, but what i am sure of is that it's fucking awesome!", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-29 16:00:12", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a1ikef/sometimes_im_not_sure_if_nonbinary_is_a_gender_or/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "sometimes i'm not sure if nonbinary is a gender or lack thereof, but what i am sure of is that it's fucking awesome!", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-29 16:03:06", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a1iles/sometimes_im_not_sure_if_nonbinary_is_a_gender_or/", "author": "gothicdimsum"}, {"title": "Had to dress feminine for my job interview today.

They misgender me and deadname me on accident but mostly it just annoys me, they're ignorant but not transphobic.  However my partners grandfather is an avid trump supporter, but mostly because hes one of those folks who thinks trump is a good businessman and will help this country. He's wrong but hes also old as hell so I'm not going to bother trying to change his mind.  He isnt racist (but he also isnt a poc ally) and hes not homophobic or transphobic  (but hes also not really doing anything to educate himself either).  I also just get weirded out by him because my cultural upbringing interprets most of his body language as very direct and intimidating, but I also know friendly shoulder and arm touching and direct eye contact are common American things.  I guess there are a lot of things he does that make me a *little* uncomfortable but not enough for me to peg him as someone I dislike.\n\nSo, now that hes started saying these things I feel anxious about family gatherings because I dont know when he gonna ask me for \"the talk\" and I also dont want to take the initiative on this.  Hes very tech savvy for a 70 year old man, he made his own PC so I am 80% sure he could just google trans issues.  Which makes me think he wants to know why *I specifically* am trans and that's a lot of pressure.  But I also know if I just calm down and talk to him we might be closer which is nice because I love my partners family.  I just hate being vulnerable.\n\nWhat I want to ask is: do any of yall have advice or anecdotes about talking to elder family members about this stuff?

Sometimes my ribs would ache as well. Since I've started practicing my posture accorting to how my physiotherapist recommended, all of that is gone!\n\nI gathered my courage and told my physiotherapist about my issues, and where they stem from (luckily, she was totally great about everything!)\n\nShe explained what was happening as follows:\n\nwhen there is pressure on the front side of the chest (which is true for binders), the back muscles pull your shoulder blades down (aka, your lower back is more arched, and your shoulders also pull back as a result). Which involves all of the muscles that were painful for me: the ones beneath my shoulderblades, the ones below my armpits, and even the muscles across my ribs (flanks) that ached.\n\nWhat she told me to do was this: when wearing your binder, feel the pressure on the front side. Your first instinct will be to push back against that, and start breathing high in your chest. Don't do that, because it'll make everything even more painful.\n\nInstead, try to feel the band beneath your shoulderblades on your back (I guess where the bra strap would've been). And while breathing, focus on that area. Feel it, and feel that part of your chest expand. So instead of breathing high in your chest and fighting against the pressure, seek the room in the back. I personally wear gc2b binders, and those are stretchy in the back, so I have lots of room to breathe there! It made perfect sense once I started breathing like that.\n\nThen continue to check in every once in a while to see if you're still breathing correctly.\n\nDoing this for just one week has helped me tremendously, and has me wearing my binder happily for 8 hours a day, while I had trouble wearing it for more than 3 hours before that.\n\nI hope this helps some transfolk out there, and please share this with anyone who might benefit!\n\ndisclaimer: I do already have problems with my shoulder/back muscles, so YMMV.

I would have a strong jaw. My hair would always be incredibly short. My clothes would depend on how I felt, I would still get piercings and tattoos and have a horrible sephora problem, but that's it. I don't care what people call me, because I am a body and I put things on the body and it should have no bearing on me as a person. They/Them feels awkward, She/Her I'm neutral to, and He/Him makes me feel squeaky. \n\nBeing told who I am isn't the goal, but some kind of inkling or validation that the way I feel is real, and that other people experience it, and that there's a name for it would help me feel less like I'm faking how I feel. I'm so terrified of being accused of being like, trendy-trans? Idk I saw the word on reddit the other day and I am horrified at the idea of someone thinking being more neutral in my life is like me being a cis woman coming up with a for funnies identity and then go back to being safely cis with my also gender-non-conforming husband. there has to be folks who feel this way", "date": "2018-12-05 05:21:21", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a3972l/i_need_to_figure_some_things_out_and_the_internet/", "author": "frequentdoodler"}, {"title": "First time posting.

I've been lurking this sub a bit, and it's been very enlightening. However, I keep questioning my gender identity, and I'm beginning to think I'll never understand that part of myself. I was wondering if anyone has any similar experiences or thoughts on the following:\n\nI've been playing with gender nonconformity for years (before I knew I'm bi/pansexual), so I'm very certain that my gender expression is varied. (I'm AFAB and I've worn men's and unisex clothing, participated in drag events, dressed as male characters for cosplay, etc.) Yet I know that expressive activities are separate from identity and may have nothing to do with it. But I am having trouble teasing apart the external influences from the internal feelings. \n\nFor example, I've definitely internalized our culture's body shaming and have a negative self-image, so how can I know if my occasional thoughts about being able to switch up my body (like having smaller breasts or none when I want that) is just another form of self loathing? I've read that many cis people long for body changes as well, so I feel like I can't know my motivation. These feelings are also not persistent and I'm generally able to go about my day without thinking about my body too much.\n\nAnother example is when I am dressing in a more masculine or androgynous way, I feel like I can't know if my motivation is to be read as a butch woman, a nonbinary person, or a man. I know I've felt a pang of something when I was dressed more masculine and I asked friends if anyone would think I'm a man and they said it's obvious I'm a woman. But that could be disappointment at outfit failure. I know how I want to dress on any given day, but I don't know why. \n\nI also can't seem to tease apart my avoidance of the male gaze from my deemphasis on femininity. I don't shave, I don't show off my breasts with padded bras and low cut tops, and I'm often uncomfortable when men are perceiving me as an object or in a sexual way (in high school this manifested as me identifying with \"ugly\"). Is my dislike of being overly feminine reactionary to the male gaze or is it related to gender identity?\n\nOn the other hand, when I think about not identifying as a woman, I get nervous because I really love women! Saying \"I'm not a woman\" makes me feel like I'm expressing internalized misogyny. I've grown up around heterosexual cis women who prioritize male attention and deprioritize female friendship, so backing out of that identity feels like I'm betraying women. Another aspect of that is that, with my body, I'm always read as a woman and have experienced sexism based on that outward appearance, so I have some particularly formative experiences in common with women and I feel like shared hardships form social bonds.\n\nAnother complication is that I've seen cis people online asking some of the same questions I've been asking myself, like \"what is it like to feel female because I just feel like myself?\" And it's because they don't feel incongruity between their identity and appearance. So I feel like if I can't determine if I'm feeling female, it's because I'm cis.\n\nSummary: I can't tell if I'm a woman who doesn't like gender roles and occasionally gender bends, or if I'm \"blending in\" socially with women while not being one.", "date": "2018-12-05 20:51:45", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a3gg50/exploring_the_unknown/", "author": "ursususer"}, {"title": "Advice on Weird Interactions", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-12-05 21:30:04", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a3gtk0/advice_on_weird_interactions/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Long Beach City Officials authorize policies protecting transgender and gender nonconforming citizens", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-05 21:32:56", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a3guk1/long_beach_city_officials_authorize_policies/", "author": "drewiepoodle"}, {"title": "Gift ideas for someone newly out?", "text": "Hi!

I had a brief one on one conversation in which I explained I wasn't mad but please could she use my pronouns correctly. She apologized and agreed to try to remember.

I was explaining that part of the reason I took the job was because being misgendered over the phone all day was effecting my mental health. she was like...\" You know this is a problem you're going to have your whole life, right?\" And was talking about how I couldn't be hurt by things like that and how she wish she could learn more sensitivity from me and I could take on some of her toughness. \n\nMy coworker is a POC and I know she meant all of this kindly and from a place of solidarity of people who share minority status.

I see it all the time, I've done it, but it seems almost compulsory here and other nonbinary subs and forums to state your assigned gender at birth in almost any introduction or conversation. I looked at a lot of posts where it shows up and see some recurring reasons that break down into a few common categories:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**QUESTIONING**\n\n* Questioning being trans/nb (\"I'm \\[AGAB\\] but think I might be nb for these reasons...\")\n* Not feeling \"enough\" of assigned gender, questioning whether that makes me trans/nb/agender, etc.\n* Does being gender nonconforming mean someone is nonbinary? (stating AGAB and gender nonconforming traits)\n* Previously identified as binary trans, maybe nb? (Sometimes state AGAB, sometimes binary trans gender or both)\n\n**DYSPHORIA**\n\n* Issues of presentation and expression (too much like AGAB stereotypes, not enough like nb stereotypes, etc.).\n* Clothing questions (specifying body type/sizes/dress codes)\n* Specific body dysphoria issues based on anatomy.\n* Validation (\"is it ok that I do this even though my AGAB is \\_\\_\\_? Do I pass?\").\n* Socialization (specific gender issues related to upbringing, change in context around old behaviors, etc.).\n\n**MEDICAL**\n\n* Types of medical transition/HRT/surgeries (seeking answers to specific questions about treatments or procedures).\n* Diagnostic criteria for specific ailments by biological sex (disclosing AGAB to doctor, etc.).\n\n**SEXUALITY**\n\n* Conflicts with partner's orientation (\"I'm \\[AGAB\\] and my partner is \\[orientation\\]\")\n* Questions about orientation related to transition (\"I'm \\[AGAB\\], can I label myself \\[orientation\\] even though I'm nb?\").\n\n**SAFETY &amp; INCLUSION:**\n\n* Looking for role models (\"Where are all the \\[AGAB\\] nonbinary people like me??\")\n* Exclusion/Inclusion (\"I can't find any nonbinary oriented resources for this \\[AGAB\\] issue\", \"I'm nb, but take up this cause because I'm \\[AGAB\\]).\n* Gender segregation (\"There's no binary option and I'm being sorted by my AGAB\").\n* Bathrooms (a million versions of this, forever and always)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll of these categories and examples have valid reasons for getting into someone's AGAB. I have done it myself for many of these reasons and I'm not saying it's never relevant to a conversation to disclose one's assigned gender at birth. Just that so many of these things don't really require us to disclose it and it could be inferred from context if it's actually necessary to understand what's being discussed. If someone is seeking validation, we can validate them without needing to know ANYTHING about them, because every one of us is valid and many of us know those insecurities and how to address them, regardless of AGAB. In other cases, like medical issues, just asking the question directly usually leads to being pointed to relevant and helpful info. If we're discussing issues related directly to someone's assigned gender and their specific issues that are springing from it, it makes sense to disclose it and discuss it (especially when it comes to discrimination, gender segregation, exclusion, etc.). If someone is asking specific questions about the effects or particular hormones or what the recovery time is for a specific surgery, it's usually implied and the relevant answers/experiences can be given without having to state our AGAB. Presentation and anatomy don't equal gender, so we can talk about fashion and anatomy issues without having to disclose every single time, most of us are going to get the context and be able to discuss the issues just fine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen we get past these most typical reasons, it seems like it's just a compulsory disclosure. Something like \"Hi, I'm a 25 y/o (AGAB) nonbinary person from Ontario, what's up my enbies?\" and that just seems straight up like making a binary for nonbinary people. I get clocked as my AGAB every day (much to my displeasure and dysphoria), so I really don't want to always automatically put that into the head of someone who can't see it. Maybe other people feel differently about that, I certainly wouldn't begrudge them using gendered language (demi\\_\\_\\_, binary pronouns, etc.) to describe themselves. I just don't like the automatic practice of stating our AGAB and creating a second tier binary, when I've already had that gender assigned to me and enforced on me my whole life. I don't find binary genders to be negative, I just find my experience with being labeled with the one I was assigned to be negative and I don't want to keep attaching it to myself, if at all possible.

I really love having shorter hair because it makes me feel more tomboyish and like I'm presenting less feminine, but not necessarily pushing the boundaries too boldly all at once, and I wanted to see in a more gradual way how it felt to have shorter hair.\n\nNow that I know I feel really good having shorter hair, I am thinking about the idea of cutting it even shorter, I really love the look of 90's short \"curtains\" type hair style ([see Winona Ryder circa 1992](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/8b/a8/778ba82a4740e246ecc86b8856a9a2ae--short-hair-cuts-short-s-hair.jpg)and [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://90sthrowback.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ldicaprio07_gl_17aug12_rex_b.jpg)) and I like that both men and women wore that hairstyle but it is more of a masculine look IMO.\n\nI was chatting with my mom this morning about my new bob haircut and how she really likes it short, and she was telling me stories about how when she was part of the new wave scene in the 80s her and her friends all had short \"boyish\" hair. I half-jokingly said \"sometimes I think it'd be rad to go full Britney and shave all my hair off\" and she said \"please don't do that\" and that she'd be \"disappointed\" if I ever did because she said she thinks I look really cute and she likes my hair.\n\nThe comment hit me more than I expected. It made me feel that coming out as non-binary would be harder than coming out as bisexual to my parents. Even though they are relatively progressive and support the LGBT community at large, her comment made me feel that a lot of her conceptions of me are constructed around the idea that I am her \"daughter\" and all the gendered connotations that come with that, and that coming out as NB might really be a lot for her to handle. Her and my dad have been \\*super\\* supportive of me since coming out as bisexual, I didn't feel like I had to explain myself or that it changed their view of me at all, but after hearing this comment it made me feel like I would disappoint them if I came out as non-binary or wanted to present more masculine because it made me feel like their idea of me as NB as opposed to \"their girl\" would completely change their view, even though \\*I\\* know fundamentally I am the exact same person.\n\nBeing in my mid-20s with a career and having graduated college already, I normally might not care this much about how my parents might think, but I recently had to quit my job due to a toxic work environment, and I'm living with them right now while I look for new work, and I might be home for a few more months. I don't necessarily \\*want\\* to put off cutting my hair and other external ways of exploring my identity until I move out, but after hearing my mom's comment I feel like I might have to.\n\nI guess I wanted to hear if other folx on this subreddit have experienced similar situations, where your parents aren't overtly shitty like kicking you out of the house or something, but maybe make passing micro-aggressive comments that make you feel uncomfortable or like you're disappointing them? How do you reconcile their feelings of disappointment with exploring and asserting your gender identity? Did anyone's parents change their mind or come around to being fully supportive after awhile?\n\nTLDR: AFAB been enjoying dressing more adrogynous/masculine than before, mom has been supportive of new look so far I think because I am still within the confines of what is considered \"feminine\" (wearing clothes from women's section, short bob). I want to continue to push the bounds but mom made comment that insinuated she'd be \"disappointed\" if I did.

I\u2019m AFAB, fine with she/her pronouns, and have experienced little to no body dysphoria in my life.

I\u2019d probably enjoy they/them pronouns but everyone genders me as female and that does not bother me either.\n\nMy dilemma is, my little feminist heart loves subverting gender norms. So living as a woman, when I\u2019d do something traditionally \u201cmasculine,\u201d (or just not feminine) I\u2019d be like \u201cyeah! Take that, gender roles!\u201d But now, when I examine how I\u2019ve always felt not-super-female at my core, it changes the landscape a bit. If I define parts of myself as masculine or feminine or other, aren\u2019t I reducing those gendered parts down to their most basic stereotype?

Cut yourself some slack when things get you down, allow yourself to feel that this is you, that you get to define your feelings and that your feelings are valid. Because they are. Maybe you don't feel that you are reacting in a socially acceptable or 'correct' way, but they are your reactions and your feelings. Take the time to have them before you try to analyse and understand them. Otherwise they become bottled.\n\nMaybe you already have coping strategies, maybe you already have an end-point in mind, maybe you don't. Whatever, research and learn - about the situations you can face and about yourself. Look into how others cope with it. Protect yourself if you have to - so don't do research at work or where others may track what you are doing. But do research. Seek out safe spaces to discuss your feelings on matters.\n\nMaybe doing something that feels affirming will help you out as well.

My only source of dysphoria relates to my genitalia. Specifically, my body has male genitalia, but my mind expects my body to have a vagina instead. (That's why I say mostly-cis; there's one thing that's definitely not cis.)\n\nA few items: no, I\u2019m not concerned I\u2019m a trans woman in denial. I was open to that hypothesis, but I\u2019ve been through plenty of therapy and ruled that out. Also not concerned that this is misunderstood dysmorphia; it\u2019s a case of genital dysphoria. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like what I have, it\u2019s that my mind expects one thing and there\u2019s an entirely separate thing in its place. This leads to considerable anxiety, and on bad (dysphoria-related) days it\u2019s unbearable. \n\nI have a supportive therapist who thinks that bottom surgery would be appropriate as a way to treat the dysphoria, and while I have some misgivings related to cost, risks, etc., I generally agree with her. As such, I\u2019m strongly considering (currently seeking referral to a surgeon to do a consultation) bottom surgery. However, I\u2019m in a relationship with a gay man. He\u2019s concerned about the future of our relationship in terms of his attraction to me physically, in terms of how this might impact me in the future, and in terms of what this means for his own sexual orientation. \n\nI\u2019m posting here in hopes of getting pointers for how to talk to him about this. I\u2019m convinced the only impacts to the relationship will be positive; I could finally treat my dysphoria and otherwise my presentation wouldn\u2019t change. From my perspective, I'm only changing this one thing, and at the end of the process I'd still be a man (whatever that means) and my partner would still be just as gay as can be (going for levity here, but seriously, I don't think that has to challenge his identity). \n\nBut whether he could still be attracted to me, and what it means for his own perception of himself; these are things I can\u2019t really control.

He was confused about this, but he was accepting of it, nevertheless I really tried to sugarcoat it and told him that it is completely fine to still use feminine pronouns for me (since we are speaking a very heavily grammatically gendered language without practical options for genderneutral terms) because I was so worried about losing him. I mean I'm still not too picky about what people call me but lately I'm just feeling more and more dysphoria about not just having an amab body. I just look at other guys in my age and all I see is how much I wish I had their body shape and could just been born as one of them. On other days I'm more ok with how I look and feel like I should just accept myself and try to work with the things I have.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNevertheless, I just feel more and more like I am lying to myself about how ok everything is and about how I'm fine with being the girlfriend and daughter. I can't relate at all to wlw content but I feel this strange connection to mlm couples. The worst thing about this is probably that I am terribly scared about this because my boyfriend, who I genuinely hope to marry in the future, is very much heterosexual and just can't see himself dating anyone beside a woman. He even asked me if I felt like I'm a man, because he would totally want to support me but he couldn't date me anymore because he's just not attracted to men. I mean that's fine. I can't tell him that he can't be straight just like you can't tell gay people to not be gay, because that's very rude and uncalled for. But it hurts so badly to think that I might never be able to completely deal with it because I will lose the man I genuinely am in love with for over 5 years now if I do so. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also not saying that I feel like I am a man.

I am so confused.\n\nI am AFAB. Some of this might be a bit blunt / NSFW.\n\nSince I was about 6 or so I kind of wanted to be a boy. I really wanted a penis and I would pray to God that I would wake up a boy. I'd have dreams I had a penis. It was upsetting when it never happened.\n\nWhen I was about 15 or so I didn't know if I was genderqueer (or an androgyne) or binary trans. I settled on binary trans. I did binding (sports bras and ace bandages) and packing (socks with some creative sewing... lol). It was pretty good for about 40% - 60% of the time, but it wasn't quite right. I was in the closet to my family so I only did this outside of the home. Confused things more for me. Was it fear that made it not right or something else?\n\nAt about 17, I decided that \"every woman envies men and kind of wants to be one\" so I'm just a normal woman. I'm guessing now that's not the case.\n\nI still have those feelings that I want a penis. Like... maybe if I had both a penis and vagina? Sometimes when I can't orgasm, I think about having a penis and it helps. Sometimes I really don't like my vagina, and other times it does not bother me. The times I don't like my vagina, I don't like looking about it or thinking about it, but being penetrated is always ok for me. I am very, very ok with my breasts. I don't want to bind them or hide them, and with partners they're pretty much fair play.\n\nWhen I get read as male (called \"sir\") I don't really get upset. It amuses me? It's not something I want all the time. That and I'm ok with being called she. \"He,\" \"They,\" and \"Hir\" don't work for me. I like being called masculine, though.

Always have, and have always absolutely hated them. I hate wearing bras; would prefer to burn them all and never have to buy one again.

I have the shoulder indents from the straps digging into me, back pain, and neck pain from these stupid sacks of fat I have to cart around. Anyways, I get a referral to the plastic surgeon...and the appointment goes to shit. [For context: I am not a small person, and I knew I was probably going to have to lose weight before getting a green light for a reduction. Sure ok.]\n\nDuring the consult he barely acknowledges my constant back pain or indents. Says that if he did the surgery now I'd have \"no breast tissue left.\" I point blank told him that's fine with me, I want them gone, I want the pain to be gone...but he doesn't care. Tells me he is going to put a note in to tell my doctor about sending me to a gastric surgeon for gastric bypass. I told him I don't want to do have surgery and that I have been losing weight on my own. He checks my chart to see my weight loss progress and tells me it's a start, but not nearly enough. He refused to even consult with me again until I lost 100+lbs (which I admit, I do need to do). The whole appointment absolutely devastated me. At the time I didn't understand why I was so upset (what I thought was going to happen did). \n\nNow that I have come to understand that I am NB, I totally know why I got so upset. I really want my breasts to either be gone or greatly reduced, and I think that I do have dysphoria when it comes to them. I have lost about 75lbs since that appointment with the surgeon (lost 95lbs total so far) and as my body is changing due to the weight loss, the dysphoria is getting worse. I find myself staring at the pec muscles that are now so visible (and glare at the now sagging, still very large breasts that hang below them). I still have the back pain, shoulder indents, and neck problems...which he said should go away with the weight loss (nope! Breasts are about the same size still but the rest of me is smaller). I have thought about binding but can't afford a legitimate chest binder, well one that would work for me the way I want it to. I'm also not sure I want them 100% gone as some times I still feel very femme, but I'd like to stop thinking about them. To be able to wear shirts without having to worry about the fit or how they distort the shirts that I want to wear. To never have to think about a bra again would be heaven! \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this.

What started triggering these feelings was by picking up a book with two people who had backgrounds in living and being taken as women who were often confused for men and who began to feel, through their own experiences and conclusions, felt that they didn't identify with either male or female and were most comfortable as identifying as they/them (Gender Failure by Ivan Coyote and Rae Spoon, in case anyone was wondering). \n\nThat resonated with me a lot, particularly in their stories of growing up. I'm...a pretty masculine woman. 6\"3, gender-neutral birth name, built like a rugby player, and because of my size I wear a lot of unisex clothes. And because of all of the above, I have often been confused for a man, or simply gotten the question \"are you a boy or girl\" a LOT. I used to be hurt by it and correct the person, but eventually I gave up and started answering by shrugging and walking away. \n\nBut here's the thing, though. There's a part of me that can't help but wonder if I'm being pushed towards the middle because of experiences like this and not because of a strong relation to the non-binary identity. It almost feels like that because people see a big question mark when they see me that I'm wondering if I should just, you know, say fuck it and embrace it, become essentially what they say I am. \n\nAnother factor I'm wondering about is mental health. I gots depression, anxiety, and PTSD and, without getting into huge details about it, a lot of self-hate stemming from bullying and lifelong emotional abuse. As a result I sabotage myself constantly and try to minimize my presence as much as possible. So I can't help but feel if identifying as non-binary might be a bad-lizard-brain subconscious desire to erase any distinctive attributes to my existence, which is TOTALLY wrong and not good in the slightest, both in terms of my self-hate and of what being non-binary actually is.\n\nI don't know...I don't know what I'm asking here.

I've mostly gotten over it and I'm pretty okay with being gendered female now. I look female so it makes sense and I don't necessarily feel at odds with femininity, but like... there's always been something that feels a little off. Every once in a while I'll catch myself thinking, \"Oh, if I was a woman...\", or being outright puzzled as to who people are referring to when they use she/her for me. I'll think, \"Is there a she/her around?\" before I realize it's me. I've only been gendered as male once, when I first cut my hair short, and I was so happy when it happened, but it's unlikely to ever happen again unless I go on T because I have such a high-pitched voice and large breasts/hips. I don't really wanna go on T, I don't want facial hair or anything, and it's too much trouble. I don't even want to bother trying to pass as non-binary/male either, it's a lot of effort given my appearance and doesn't really work.\n\nI'm also pansexual and especially attracted to GNC people so to some extent, I can't help but wonder if it's primarily an aesthetic/cultural identity for me. I don't even have much dysphoria anymore honestly. I can look at my body without disgust, I don't care about pronouns, and it's easiest for me to present female so that's what I do. I feel like a fake compared to other trans binary people I know because for them it seems like a really strong internal force whereas for me at this point it's more that I keep forgetting that I'm seen as female. So I was gonna ignore the way I felt, but someone I know recently changed their Facebook pronouns to \"they\" and I spent half an hour crying over it.\n\nI guess I know I'm non-binary, I just... don't really want to deal with the reality of it. I don't want to change my pronouns even if it would feel better because it feels like far too much effort having to correct people, but I figure I won't even be seen as valid if I keep using she/her. I barely even mention I'm pansexual/bisexual anymore to straight people because I got sick to death of having to explain myself whenever I came out. And I know I'll have to break up with my straight boyfriend once I tell him I'm non-binary. There's no way my old-school Catholic parents are going to be okay with it either.

My hope is to start on anti-androgen and see how that feels, and then decide whether I want to start estrogen later.  The doctor I am going to see is in a big medical practice with a lot of different kinds of specialists.  I actually already go there to see a different endocrinologist for my thyroids, as well as a general practitioner (but I go somewhere else to see a psychiatrist).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am somewhat concerned that I might run in to some sort of gatekeeping before I can start hormones.  I don't know anything about the doctor I am going to see beyond what is on her public profile, so my worry may be completely baseless, but that doesn't stop me from worrying.  I have known there were some things I really disliked about my body for a long time.  However, it didn't really occur to me until about a year ago that it might be gender related.  I'm 24, and I can easily imagine some people saying that that is too old for me to \"suddenly\" realize that I am trans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor a long time, I've known that I really hate having hair on my face, or chest, or in my crotch.  Also, I hate erections, and I'm not fond of balls.  On the other hand, I'm really not sure how I would feel about having breasts.  That's part of why I want to start anti-androgens but am still unsure about estrogen.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetween 5th and 7th grade, I had very long and very thick hair.  I started puberty late, so during that time I was also very short, had a high pitched voice, and no facial hair.  People my age who I met for the first time usually viewed me as a boy, but people my parents' age usually assumed I was a girl.  At the time it didn't really bother me one way or the other, but it agitated my parents to no end.  Nowadays I don't think I could pass as a woman or even really androgynous, due to my voice and the shape of my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough I don't really feel comfortable with gender roles, there is one male stereotype that I have completely embraced: I do not like thinking about clothes.  I don't like shopping for clothes, or trying them on and having them not fit, or picking out which clothes I am going to wear in the morning, or making sure the clothes I am going to wear are washed and dry.  I want clothes that keep me warm, but aren't too hot, don't itch, cover up the parts of my body that I hate, don't restrict my movement too much, and have pockets.  And I don't like thinking about having to find clothes that do all of those things.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm also frustrated by the fact that \"men's\" shorts and occasionally \"men's\" long pants are the only pants that have big pockets.  Even skorts that I've tried after hearing they supposedly had \"big pockets\" have small pockets in comparison to \"men's\" shorts.  I am somewhat afraid that my decision to continue wearing men's clothing could lead someone to say that I'm \"not trans enough\" to get hormones.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried wearing false breasts both at home and outside (but not at work), and I feel fairly neutral about them.  But, then, I need to wear them with a bra, which is an extra article of clothing that I have to think about.  With my body shape and size, I have been unable to find any strap bras that actually fit.  I have found a few sports bras that sort-of kind-of fit me, though.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, as I said at the beginning of this post, my fears may be completely baseless.  I may walk away from my appointment in two weeks with a prescription for anti-androgen without any fuss.  And even if I don't, I have the means to go to another doctor's practice, albeit it will involve more unpleasant delays.  I really just wanted to vent right now.  If you've read through this post so far, thanks for listening to my rambling.

Luckily, through the people I knew (again through friend one) I've been able to get regularly booked for shows and other art stuff in town (i'm a musician). \n\nA friend of a friend had been following me through shows and posts about my shows and explicitly stated she wanted to be my friend bc she liked my vibe. It was great on so many levels. \n\nFirstly, she was so upfront about wanting to be my friend and know me more. No guesswork! \ud83d\ude03 And since she knew me through my special interests (music, performance, fashion, art in general) she would always engage me based on that! \n\nSecondly, I've been struggling with gender identity and my almost exclusively VERY video-game-dude-bro str8 guy friends were causing me a lot of dysphoria. Not because of anything they do or say to me - they're actually great &amp; part of our larger social circle which is largely LGBT - but when I'm with them I'm seen as a dude just like them and I end up acting that way because of involuntary masking. \n\nThis new friend - Ill call her Sunny - immediately acknowledged me as someone who is NB and very femme. One of our first long text conversations was just us trading looks from The Met Gala and talking about what we think of them. She invited me to a party and there she introduced me to some more of her girl friends and included me in planning a girls night! \n\nSince then we've been dropping compliments on each other's selfies and we've had another outing to THE LIBRARY!! (nice n quiet!) and a park (doGS!) and she was into it when I wanted to just watch a turtle for a bit. \n\nAnd she also has anxiety so we've been able to connect over that! \n\nI'm so used to feeling excluded (often unintentionally) by the people I want to be around due to either my low social energy and awkwardness or because I'm not seen as \"one of the girls\" (usually it's not the girls who don't want me around; it's the guys not wanting to be around the girls and wanting/expecting me to come with them) and I'm just feeling so valid right now as both a non binary individual and as an autistic adult and I'm excited for the future! \n\nTL;DR: \n\nI made/am maintaining a friendship by myself for the first time in my adult life.

In particular I've been unhappy with a lot of the masculine features. Jawline/face-shape, build/figure, my body hair &amp; my hairline, my chest; things like that. And I've been wanting to fit a more feminine aesthetic. I've been wanting to try out a lot of feminine clothing (I'm trying to work myself up to!

But yea, any suggestions? I need to appear decent enough to not seem suggestive, but I can't handle a bar or even a training bra i don't think. And it's summer here right now so layers not an option.", "date": "2018-12-22 02:37:36", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8h23e/need_to_appear_decent/", "author": "colourfulsoul369"}, {"title": "Feeling trapped", "text": "I don't know what my body is supposed to look like, but it's not this.\n\nRight now, that's all I know. I look at page after page of pictures under the \"androgyny\" tag, and I see what I wish my body looked like. They are all white, they are all thin, they are all delicate and fragile. Their tits are small, their hips are narrow, their faces have jaws and cheekbones that could cut glass. Their eyes are huge and deep, ageless. They look like elves or angels, and I want to look like them, and I never, ever will.\n\nThat's not self-loathing, that's not pessimism, that's straight-up fucking biology. I am five-ten and burly - not six-two and willowy, not five-four and curvy. I am 190 pounds of soft muscle and hard fat. I have never broken a bone because my bones are as thick as tree limbs, my wrists too large to grip in one hand. My ass is big and firm but not shapely. My thighs are horselike with no gap in between, my arms are strong but too soft for any muscle definition. My tits are big but partly because my chest is thick, barrel-like - it gives me a deep voice and makes me pop buttons on shirts when I breathe, in a way that is not sexy and scandalous but just embarrassing and expensive.\n\nLooking at these pictures makes me feel exactly how I've felt all my life - slow, clumsy, misshapen, as if I'm interacting with the world through a spacesuit. Most days it feels like I can't truly touch anything, like every motion is a fumbling approximation of what I intended, like every sense is dull and muffled. When I look in the mirror I can see myself in the eyes - well, not in them, but behind them. The eyes aren't shaped right, they're not the right color, they're not mine, but behind the face I don't recognize I see my own fear looking out. That's been the same all my life. I can't ever remember seeing a face in the mirror that looked like mine.\n\nRight now, it feels like it's the having of a face at all that I resent. I spent today looking up local ordinances on the wearing of masks in public. I'd like to assemble a collection of beautiful masks, all different, that I could choose from when I go out and wear all day. I hate the feeling that participating in daily life requires taking a stand on who I am as a person. I would like to go out in a voluminous robe and a mask, so that what I say and do is just what I say and do, not what a WOMAN says and does, not what a MAN says and does... I do not want to be assigned a category and I don't want to prop one up by existing. But it seems that I don't have a choice. There is no way to opt out of people looking at you and assigning you a role based on the first fucking characteristic they see.\n\nThirty years of first-person gaming and silent protagonists have taught me that the essential ME is in my hands. They're the only part of myself I like. They're the only parts of me that look exactly like they should, the only parts I enjoy watching do what they do. They're neither masculine nor feminine, and they're not pretty - I bite my nails and chew my fingertips until they bleed. But none of that matters when they're writing, or cooking, or drawing. All that matters is that they're sure and strong and they've never failed to do as I asked.\n\nI've always talked to people best when we walk side-by-side, not looking at each other. I've always done best online, in text, where my voice doesn't interfere with what I have to say. I don't want to have a face. I don't want to have a voice. I just want to bring the quest item and turn it in, and be judged on the basis of how well I did the thing.\n\nIt's hard to see a way out of dysphoria right now. I can't think of any shape within my physical capacities that I would like better than the one I have. I love having long hair and I love having tits, but I could take or leave the bottom system if I'm honest. I want to have a baby and do mom things. I want to be a knight, too, but I'm not sure if it's for the sense of purpose or the armor. I want to be maximally female and maximally male at the same time, and that doesn't seem to be an option.", "date": "2018-12-22 03:41:15", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8hidr/feeling_trapped/", "author": "GentleZacharias"}, {"title": "Recently came out as non-binary, been doing my best to build up my self esteem.

My parents have always used a gender neutral nickname for me (not because it was gender neutral, it just kind of happens to be) and when I came out to them I told them that I wanted to play with using that nickname as my name but that that shouldn\u2019t really affect them because they already call me that. Since then I have still been introducing myself with my given gendered name and haven\u2019t talked about my name much recently with my spouse though we had talked about it previously and I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot. Today I got a piece of mail from my dad addressed to me as that nickname and my last name. It was the first time I\u2019d ever seen it like that and it was a serious gender euphoria moment. My spouse pointed out how my dad had addressed it and I immediately said how nice that was. He responded by laughing and saying that it was really weird that my dad would write my name that way. Many years ago he also told me that he would never feel comfortable using that nickname for me because he knew other people with that name that he didn\u2019t like. So between all of that I felt pretty hurt and angry and invalidated. I feel like even if I wanted to start using that name I couldn\u2019t now because my spouse made fun of me for it. I know I shouldn\u2019t give him that kind of power and he is saying now that if I want to try using the nickname as my name that he would support that, but I\u2019m really struggling to let it go. I think the biggest thing that I\u2019m hung up on was that it was a major gender euphoria moment and made me feel pretty instantly like I want to start using that more as my name. But because of the context of the interaction this morning and whatever I don\u2019t feel comfortable expressing that to my spouse. Probably I just need some distance from the feeling of being laughed at and dismissed but I thought talking about it with folks who might understand could help too. And I fully recognize that in the grand scheme of things I\u2019m incredibly lucky to have a super supportive spouse, but I\u2019m still feeling hurt and angry and shameful and whatnot.

But even I have questions that prove I don't knoe too much about the gender, maybe you'll help me out.\n\n1. Ironically, my first introduction to the NB gender was a DoseOfBuckley video(I was at a horrible genderist anti SJW phase back then), in it he argues, \"why can't you just be a guy who's into makeup, nail polish and sports\" or something like that. I think he's saying why can't you just be a dude who's into masculine, feminine, and/or in-between and still be called a guy/gal. What is your counter argument to this?\n\n2. While watching NB videos, I saw this one about a person who claims they were AFAB and then a trans male and then as a NB. They then said, \"If I was born male, I would be happy\". Being AMAB, I displayed often feminine traits but I also did things society has accepted to be male oriented. Sometimes, if I was born female, I would've been NB at some point(funny enough, I did had dysphoria about being female when I was 13). But I also noticed some trans people talking about potential in successful surgery of a man getting vaginal parts(or the other way around). Which gives me the question, if hormone therapy(or surgery) could advance to the point where people can successfully identify as a new gender and sex(ones that fall under male and female), would NB as well as the other genders be considered of no use anymore(not saying that out of hate against the multiple genders, I'm just curious)?\n\n3. Since I'm AMAB, a lot of my family and peers has used he pronouns to identify me. I haven't told them I'm NB yet, and I don't want to, because I feel like it could cause a lot of confusion and chaos amongst them since they accepted this genderist idea of only 2 binary genders. It doesn't help either that most of them are likely transphobic. Despite this, I want any newcomer I come across with to use they pronouns instead. Are you in a situation similar to this? If so, how do you deal with it?\n\nThanks in advance for answering these questions.", "date": "2018-12-22 17:31:21", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8mnbt/some_non_binary_questions_i_have/", "author": "blacksonic56"}, {"title": "My dad sent me a folder of enby fashion stuff so we could both try and better understand what style I wanna start going for after I've told him I want clothes for Christmas and I'm so hecking happy y'all're all cute and I love y'all", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-22 18:15:29", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8n11i/my_dad_sent_me_a_folder_of_enby_fashion_stuff_so/", "author": "CosmosCopilot"}, {"title": "hewwo OwO to all my nb pals!!", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-22 18:35:03", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8n6xr/hewwo_owo_to_all_my_nb_pals/", "author": "Swifferdoodles"}, {"title": "Idk what's going on with my dysphoria?", "text": "I'm 19 and transmasc nb and basically I've become non-dysphoric?

I'm a little nervous but thankfully I've been both out of their faith and materially independent from them for a decade now, and I don't have a lot of my ongoing self-worth tied up in what they think of me.  I don't expect much, but I want to give them a chance. And most importantly I want them to find out on my terms.\n\n\n\n&gt;Dear Mom and Dad,\n\n&gt;I have to explain something to you about myself, because it is very important to me and I am going through changes that have distinctly improved my life, happiness, and sense of self. \u00a0\u00a0I know you care about and love me, and I want to be authentic and honest with you and all the other people I care most about. \n\n&gt;For several years now I have been quietly questioning my identity and reflecting on the ways I view myself and how I would most like to interact with the world. \u00a0I have come to the conclusion that I am gender non-binary, which means that I don't fit into fixed male/female definitions of gender. I also am transfeminine, meaning that although my personal sense of gender is not entirely female, overall my identity is more feminine than the male gender I was assigned to at birth.\n\n&gt;My gender does not inherently change anything about who I was or am, apart from the name, pronouns, and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender I am not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be more authentically myself in all my relationships. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender.\n\n&gt;This year I have started taking hormone replacement medication and this has done more good for me in a few months than any changes I have tried to make in the past several years. \u00a0I feel much more in touch with myself and who I\u2019m meant to be. And I have chosen a name for myself that better reflects who I am. However both of these parts of my transition have not changed who I am, because this is who I always was, even if no one could see it with their eyes.\n\n&gt;Here are things I need you to know: \u00a0I do not feel comfortable being referred to by traditionally male pronouns (he/him/his/himself), but ask that others refer to me as they/them/their/themself. \u00a0I also ask that you use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as \u201cchild\u201d instead of \u201cson\u201d and so on. If you\u2019re unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help. \u00a0I understand that these changes for how to talk about me may be confusing at first and it will take some time to adjust, especially when it comes to my chosen name; but what matters most to me is the willingness and effort to learn and use them.\n\n&gt;I would love and appreciate your support, however I know what the LDS faith tells you about gender. \u00a0I will neither go out of my way to persuade you of what you should believe nor will I argue with you about my validity. \u00a0I am aware there are narratives your church has for how I \u201cbecame\u201d this way; I unequivocally reject all of them. I sincerely hope that you will come to look past what others have told you your child should conform to so that you may see me as I truly am. Transitioning is not something I started lightly, nor is it something I was tricked or deceived into doing; it has taken me over four years to reach this point, and I have talked to multiple therapists and doctors about it. \u00a0Again, this is not a matter for debate. I will not tolerate abusive behavior, bad faith, or contentiousness about my identity. I am not telling you what you have to believe, but I am telling you where my boundaries are. The choice to transgress those boundaries is yours alone. How I respond to breaches of my boundaries is mine.\n\n\n&gt;I know this all may sound strange and uncertain; it\u2019s completely normal to experience strong emotions when a loved one transitions, but this is important and necessary to me. \u00a0Therefore I ask that you take some time to carefully consider what I've written and how you would like to respond, and to first respond back via letter or email before we talk directly. \u00a0I am not expecting this to be easy for either you or me. But if you are willing to act in good faith towards me, I am willing to hear what you have to say.\n\n\n&gt;Love, \n&gt;Your oldest child \n&gt;[Chosen Name]", "date": "2018-12-23 21:07:10", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8yd3r/coming_out_nonbinary_to_mormon_parents_with_a/", "author": "EnbyAndii"}, {"title": "Please someone make an nb dating app!", "text": "Anyone else nb and attracted to other nb individuals?", "date": "2018-12-23 21:10:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8ye7d/please_someone_make_an_nb_dating_app/", "author": "HappyVirusFriend"}, {"title": "Feeling fancy today, exploring masc and fem holiday looks.", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-23 21:43:46", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/a8yo3e/feeling_fancy_today_exploring_masc_and_fem/", "author": "esorous"}, {"title": "To everyone who can\u2019t be as expressive of their gender at home for the holidays", "text": "You are still valid.

Need help/advice!", "text": "Hi, \n\nI am masculine nonbinary. I identify as something that is not really a man or a woman (androgynous), but tend a little towards the masculine side I think because I am more comfortable with 'he' and more of the secondary male sexual characteristics(still not all of them) than female. \n\nI started transitioning to male by taking testosterone, and for the first few years this went pretty nice, as there was still a good deal of androgyny retained while I could still pass as 'he'. After about 3 years on it, I started feeling dysphoria the other way, such as feeling my face is too masculine, and having women hit on me, which I discovered I really don't like at all (I'm asexual/but this possibly has something to do with my gender, too?) Also my hair is falling out, which, if in a male pattern would completely obliterate any possibility of ambiguity and my hair is one of the main ways I express this ambiguity, so I really don't feel like I could feel ok without it. Also I was abused by someone with male pattern baldness, so I would really like to not be reminded of that every time I look in the mirror. It's pretty much not an option for me, I've realized. To complicate things further, having more estrogen than testosterone in my system makes me drastically more vulnerable to severe states of depression, even if you don't factor in bodily dysphoria and the social aspect of it. I've tried lowering my dose of t; it still tends to rapidly cause depression, even if it's lowered slightly, and I really don't think lowering the dose would stop the changes I would like to stop, only slow them down. For these reasons, I am considering going off T entirely. I can probably find ways to deal with depression or increase my masculinity, such as working out my upper body and keeping my body fat percentage low,  but I can't get my androgynous hairstyle back if it is lost. I also can't deal with other things that cause the masculine side of the dysphoria....its a bit harder for me to pin point than the feminine side of it but its very real. So...\n\nI'm thinking of stopping T. I know it's going to be hell, but I already have a beard and top surgery and naturally have very small hips. I also am a very small person, usually perceived as 'delicate' and 'extra feminine' somehow purely due to my size when not on T. I don't know how well I will still pass, but I would figure I would still be viewed as at least androgynous. The main thing that really freaks me out is the depression, body fat redistribution if I put on weight (seems to be fairly manageable if I stay very thin - like not emaciated anorexia thin but pretty damn thin - don't know how maintainable this is my whole life ) Anyone have any insight or possible alternatives? I've tried certain products to prevent mpb but it either irritates my scalp and makes my hair fall out, or is more feminizing in certain ways (like at the hips) than my endogenous estrogen even is, so it's pretty intolerable. I feel like if I could stop T and at least be seen as ambiguous most of the time and not purely feminine, then I could be ok and find some way to deal with the depression. I feel so frustrated trying to feel comfortable in my body and I feel like there will never be a time when it will just be ok.

Not quite a crack, but just a straight DROP. I\u2019m a fairly ranged alto, so my voice is naturally deeper, but my throat has been feeling strange for a little while, and when I tried my lower ranges, it was easier. I can even get a good \u201cLet\u2019s get some shoes\u201d level of fabulously flamboyant in my voice, which is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do. I\u2019m a gay man dammit, not a valley girl, so this was a happy win.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the S/O reacts to the news. He\u2019s been gone for the week visiting family, so it might be a bit of a shock for him to see and hear me. He\u2019s been INCREDIBLY supportive of my transition, and I love him to death, but I know he\u2019s not really into a more masculine look.

I am AFAB but I never really liked stereotypically feminine things. Growing up, I always felt like this meant there was something wrong with me. After educating myself, I\u2019ve realized that I was most likely experiencing gender Dysphoria. I don\u2019t think I am a girl, but I don\u2019t really want to be a boy either, although I do want to embrace more masculine traits in myself. I have a lot of Dysphoria regarding my chest and I eventually would love to get top surgery. I think I might be a demiboy or something like that, but I also don\u2019t really feel like using labels.  \nAll in all, I\u2019m just very confused and a little scared. I was raised in a strictly Mormon household and believed that queerness was a sin for a very long time. I now realize that this is completely wrong, and that there is nothing wrong with being queer, but i still have a lot of internalized guilt and doubts. My mother is still in the religion and I don\u2019t feel completely safe talking about my identity with her yet.

You do not need to be currently insured to participate in this study.

Your participation in this study will remain anonymous to all others but the researchers.

I'm an AFAB who came to the realisation about four years ago that I have never identified as a woman. I would describe myself as transmasculine nonbinary --- I feel an immense sense of freedom when I lean way more into the masculine side of things; when I first got my hair cut short, it was such a spectacular relief.\n\nHowever, recently I've started questioning again, and constantly drilling myself on what I want to do in the future. For the most part, I'm reasonably okay with my body as it is now --- my chest is very small and not really noticeable thank goodness, and apparently I'm naturally androgynous and a lot of the time pass as a man. However, whenever I speak I feel like my voice gives me away, and makes me feel distanced from myself, like I'm spectating in my own life. Lately I've also been messing around with FaceApp and realised (despite the shame and embarrassment that has been so ingrained in me) that I would really like a beard. I seem to want to look very masculine but without being fully called a transgender man, for some reason --- and I'm afraid of that. \n\nI guess my question really is, where do I go from here? I've been toying in my head with the possibility of transitioning in the future, but I'm worried that transitioning would push me too far in the masculine direction. I'm also worried that it would remove any romantic prospects (my dad told me immediately upon coming out that no one would love me). I'm scared of being transgender because I know that I will probably have to deal with a ton of discrimination. But on the flip side, if I don't transition, I'm scared of my body becoming more feminine with age --- or missing the opportunity to be freely myself. Maybe testosterone and/or surgery, as terrifying as it could be to take that leap (I've never had surgery in my life), could make me feel happier. Life is short, and all; I don't want to get older and regret not doing something sooner. I would certainly like to broaden out my shoulders, deepen my voice a bit, and maybe get that bit of a beard.\n\nI don't have any trans friends, so I'm unsure of who to talk to about how I feel. It's hard not to feel a dreadful sense of imposter syndrome whenever I realise that I am actually part of the LGBT community. I'm scared too, of all that I could have to deal with if I'm more open. Right now, I'm toeing the line where I'm pretty androgynous but can still safely pretend to be cisgender if I don't feel safe --- I'm only out to my immediate family, a handful of friends and a therapist who I don't get to see often. If I was able to try testosterone out, that social safety stealth blanket might be taken away. Would it be worth it?\n\nThanks all!\n\nTLDR: Transmasc NB, I'm having a bit of a crisis about maybe trying testosterone or surgery in the future/coming out", "date": "2018-12-27 20:01:57", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/aa2mel/unsure_of_what_to_do/", "author": "stileshasbadjuju"}, {"title": "While I will never like my chest, I like the androgyny in this candid", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-12-27 20:31:04", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/aa2wcq/while_i_will_never_like_my_chest_i_like_the/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "hi hello i\u2019m looking for pals", "text": "hi my name is sawyer and i\u2019m 18 and nonbinary and i have like zero queer friends and i just need people to talk to so pls pm me if you want to chat and be pals!

Rather than the adjustments that ideally result from coming out as transgender, I kinda got a shrug and an okay. I've found I have the need to be seen as my  gender; my social dysphoria is getting strong enough that it needs to be addressed.

I have not come out to my parents, my brother, or my SIL. My parents are fairly supportive, though I don't think they know much about trans &amp; non-binary identities. My brother might be more challenging, and I'm really unsure about my SIL. I'm planning on sending them all roughly the same letter. Here it is: \n\nDear (Family),\n\nI want to share some news with you, and I\u2019ve been thinking for a while about the best way to tell you, so I\u2019ve written this letter. I\u2019m non-binary. You probably don\u2019t know what that means, so I\u2019ll explain. Non-binary describes people that do not fit neatly into the gender binary of man or woman. I am not a woman, I am non-binary. The reason I\u2019m sharing this with you is because up until now, it has felt like something I need to hide. But I am not ashamed of who I am, and I want to be open with you. I\u2019m sure that you have a lot of questions running through your head, so I\u2019ll try to answer some of them.\n\nNon-binary falls under the transgender umbrella, as transgender describes people who do not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is separate from biological sex, and many trans people will go through a social transition and/or a medical transition. I\u2019m not planning on going through hormone replacement therapy or surgery, as I\u2019m hopeful that exercise and clothing will be enough to address my discomfort with certain aspects of my body. However, I am going through a social transition, which means I am telling others about my gender identity and I am telling others how I want to be addressed. I am not comfortable with she/her pronouns or being called a woman/lady/girl. When someone uses these to describe me, it feels like they\u2019re talking about someone else. I ask that you use they/them pronouns for me. For example, \u201c(Name) left their mail here. I\u2019ll send them a text so they can pick it up\u201d or \u201cHave you seen (Name)?\u201d \u201cYes, they\u2019re in the kitchen peeling potatoes,\u201d. This is really important to me. The most common objection that people have about they/them pronouns is that it refers to a group of people, not one person. But the singular they has been in use for many years to describe someone of unknown gender. For example, \u201csomeone left their keys here,\u201d or \u201cthey hung up without saying anything\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve come out at work, and asked everyone to use they/them pronouns for me. People have been accepting, and they\u2019re doing well for the most part. But to help you understand why this is important for me, I\u2019ll explain how it feels when someone doesn\u2019t use the right pronouns. Last week, a few people came to tour the shelter. My boss introduced me to our visitors and used she/her pronouns. I immediately felt my anxiety rise, my heart was pounding, and I felt awful - like who I am is shameful or inconvenient. It affected me for the rest of the day, and I lost sleep because I was trying to think of how to address it with her. When someone uses she/her to refer to me, it doesn\u2019t feel right. It\u2019s similar to when someone uses the wrong pronouns for you, it\u2019s glaringly obvious and maybe a little uncomfortable. But when someone gets them right, it feels amazing. Recently, I overheard a co-worker\u2019s phone conversation where he used they/them when speaking about me and I couldn\u2019t stop grinning. I felt so happy and light for the rest of the day. In addition to they/them pronouns, I would like you to use gender-neutral terms like child or our youngest instead of daughter and sibling instead of sister. I expect an adjustment period but I would really appreciate your effort. These changes go a long way toward making me feel seen, accepted, and comfortable in my body and surroundings. \n\nThis discovery and this process has been difficult for me. It\u2019s tough to come to the realization that something\u2019s not right and the only way you can move through life is by making yourself vulnerable and telling other people. Jason has been really supportive, and he has helped me more than he\u2019ll ever know. I\u2019ve also been seeing a therapist for a while to process these feelings. Even though it hasn\u2019t been easy, it feels great to be true to myself and honor myself by being honest with others. But this is all still very fresh for me, and I\u2019m feeling pretty raw so there may be some questions I\u2019m not able to answer. I\u2019ve linked some resources at the bottom, and I would really like you to read through them before we talk. Please reach out to me when you feel ready. \n \nLove always,\n(Name)\n", "date": "2018-12-28 19:13:04", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/aada34/can_i_get_some_feedback_on_my_coming_out_letter/", "author": "insunnydale"}, {"title": "I know I'm still young but...", "text": "I really want to find someone who loves me already.

I identified mostly as a butch lesbian up until now and had some issues with some residents talking about me behind my back and asking a lot questions as older people do. I've been called he, she, and it in a single conversation and have laughed at lots of jokes about myself. All the facility staff knew I was a girl and most of the residents knew I was too but they just thought I was really weird cause I looked like a 12 year old boy. Every time I told someone my name there was a lot of explaining to do....\n\n Fast forward to this week and my client has just moved to a new facility and I am super trans. I am experimenting with a new name while still using my nickname i've had since birth and was considering using it at work because I would be in a new place but I ended up not doing that because all of the other companions of my client are still working with her and they use my old name and i'm not ready to tackle this with all of them yet. \n\nWith the staff at this new place I've been introducing myself and they automatically use she/her bc my name is feminine but with the residents I introduce myself and they usually mishear it/correct it to a masculine name and use he/him. Today I kept getting asked if I was a boy or girl by lots of them and I kept avoiding the question and let them assume that I was a young boy. I decided to introduce myself to a big group with the nickname I'm trying out because they already were assuming I was a boy and didn't want to complicate things. One of the younger facility staff who I had just introduced myself to (with my original nickname) heard what was going and came up and said \"Hey just so I don't get confused what are your pronouns?\" and I said that I use they/them and I felt really cool that someone asked me that outside an LGBT space. \n\nBut yeah I ended up forcing myself to pass as a dude for 8 hours today and I thought it was fine because \"at least it's not a girl!\" but now I am realizing how emotionally exhausted I am after letting myself get misgendered multiple ways and making myself do that all day and i'm like ???? I don't really know what I want to do about this?? I don't know if I could come out as nonbinary at work because these are 70-100 year olds I am dealing with here and I don't even know where I would begin? I'm not even sure I would have the confidence and emotional energy to come out to the staff here and my coworkers because I know almost all of them would not know what nonbinary is and might even reject it&gt;&gt;??? (i'm not out to my family yet too) Is it even worth it to try?\n\nAnyways I guess I am just looking for support here and thoughts on this whole situation? If I were to come out do is there any advice on doing this with very old people? I feel kind of overwhelmed thinking about this because I've kind of tangled myself up with two different names and three sets of pronouns these past few days.\n\nhopefully this make sense!!\n\ntldr; I work with a woman in her 90s and around lots of elderly people and was wondering if anyone has advice for navigating this realm as a nonbinary person", "date": "2018-12-30 04:32:30", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/aasqmy/explaining_nonbinary_to_elderly/", "author": "yuumou"}, {"title": "Winning \u201cMx.
