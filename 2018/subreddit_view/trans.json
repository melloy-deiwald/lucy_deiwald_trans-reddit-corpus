I\u2019ve read enough at this point to realize that the resulting panic is pretty normal. Such as \u201cOh my god, this can't be happening. This can't be real. You can\u2019t be serious. Stop. Just stop it.\u201d One part of my brain basically running a slideshow of memories of all the things I\u2019ve said, done, or thought that point towards my being trans. The other half of my brain reacting to every word from the first with pitchforks, torches, and crying sessions. In an attempt to resolve the conflict I even started logging them to a spreadsheet. First column: things that point to me being trans. Second column: place for reactionary brain to get out it\u2019s panicking, venting, and curse words. Third column: arguments that I\u2019m not trans. I don\u2019t know if it helped but either way this turns out for me, that spreadsheet is going to be a very amusing read later in life.\n\nAnd of course the doubts of if this is even real or i\u2019m just losing it. But if there was no validity to the idea i might want to change my gender, then why am I freaking out. If i\u2019m not trans, then why won\u2019t this thought let me go. Why would I be losing sleep over this, and why is there a civil war going on inside my head.\n\nOne of the biggest hang ups i\u2019ve had is that so much of the narrative around transitioning, at least from the outside, is \u2018becoming who you really are\u2019 and \u2018leaving your old self behind\u2019. That being trans is going to change _everything_ and you should be happy about it. But even if you\u2019re not happy with your current life, that is a massive bucket of anomie to dump on someone. There is a fear that things won\u2019t be better, sure, but there is also a (to me, greater) fear of losing yourself along the way. That who you are will no longer be recognizable in who you are to become.\n\nBut there is a response to that which shows up in basically every thread, it just took a while to get through to me. I don\u2019t actually have to do anything about these feelings. That its OK to feel them and act or not act on them as I choose. That i could say, \u201cI really love low color saturation and that\u2019s not manly but so what fuck you\u201d, and still also say \u201cYou know what, eyeliner is really just too much right now. No, I don\u2019t want to do that\u201d\n\nI still don\u2019t know what trans is or what it means on a personal level. I still don\u2019t know. And part of me is still calling this whole thing an absurd dream that I will wake up from at some point. I do know I\u2019ll try experimenting with clothing a bit. Maybe dig up my good looking earrings and nail polish.* But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all. I\u2019ve done more for a Rocky Horror showing than just that. But then it was a \u2018game\u2019 and this time its real. Does this make me trans? No, maybe, but mostly who cares. If I like it then i\u2019ll keep doing it. If I don\u2019t then I\u2019ll stop. If I want to do more I\u2019ll do more. What label people want to put on that doesn\u2019t really matter right now. That word is no longer a threat to me.\n\nAs a bit of an aside, I think the trans community can improve how it deals with prior selves. Deadnames, dead identities, that prior selves are dead. I understand why people think and why people feel that way. I understand that for some people that is explicitly the point, or is a lynchpin in how you think about transitioning. And I\u2019m not objecting. But at least for me and perhaps people like me, I need to be able to draw a contiguous line from who I was, to who I am, to where I\u2019m going. So if trans is the way i\u2019m going, and I don\u2019t know that yet, then the current me doesn\u2019t have to die to get there.\n\nJust change a little.\n\nSmall moves, Ellie, small moves (EDIT: reference [Contact](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oB6NNbFHjCc))\n\n*All cis men have their ears pierced and have a box of pretty earrings somewhere in their house, right?

With every story you told there\u2019s an undercurrent of emotion and related thoughts that will never be conveyed by words alone. So the most someone can get from your stories is a shadow play of what you truly feel. Not enough to come to a conclusion. And beyond that, human memory is just kinda shitty at remembering things. Shocking, I know.\n\n\nSo asking us will never be able to tell you what *your* answer should be to something as fundamental as who you are. And anyone who tries to tell you with confidence who you are is just being an asshole.\n\n\nBut please. PLEASE. Keep asking.\n\n\nCurrent estimates place the trans population at roughly 0.5% of the general population. That sounds small, doesn\u2019t it. But that\u2019s 1 in 200 people. I easily pass 200 people on my way to work each day. And when compared to the populations of regions, nations, the world itself\u2026 There are millions of trans people out there. And they all know how hard this is.\n\n\nNo matter how frightened or angry or depressed or conflicted you\u2019re feeling, millions of people have stood where you\u2019re standing right now. Millions of people have been there and know exactly what you\u2019re feeling. And an untold number more have also questioned and decided that they don\u2019t need to change.\n\n\nSo we know how important this is to you and we\u2019re right here.

I have family connections with the queer community, but no personal friends who are trans -- so I'm asking Reddit. \n\nI'm writing a novel in which one of the minor characters (\"Jene\") is a transwoman. She's about 29 years old.  She's my main character's best friend, and they've been close since high school. \n\nHere are my questions: \nThe story doesn't discuss Jene's transition, but at age 29 she's pretty well-put-together and self-confident. My main character, who's a cis straight woman a couple years younger, really admires Jene for her strength and certainty about life. Jene makes a few references to her past struggles, but her personal history is not the focus of the scenes where she shows up. \n\nSo one question I have is: I'm aware of what an odyssey it is for someone to transition. Is it reasonable to present someone who is 29 years old and has really put her life together in a good strong way? Or would a person of that age inevitably still be struggling with the whole giant life-change of transition? Jene is a professional photographer, an energetic dancer, single at the moment but gregarious and pretty engaged with life. She lives in Seattle, so she's got a good community environment. \n\nI guess a related question would be: What are the main challenges facing transwomen who are already transitioned? Maybe dating? Or contemplating options for future parenthood? \n\nMy second question is: My main character, Bridget, was a shy girl in high school who loved chess and sci fi and all things digital, so she hung out with the nerds. Jene (who was Gene back then) was seen as a weird kid because he was struggling with feeling like a girl, and the two of them became buddies. The friendship only strengthened as Gene transitioned to Jene. Is there any reason why this sort of friendship would seem improbable?\n\nIn general, is there anything I should be aware of in creating a trans character? Again -- she's only a minor part of the novel -- I wouldn't feel like I have the right to create a trans protagonist -- but I just want to get her right.

Some of my earliest memories are of myself starting kindergarten and crying myself to sleep at night because I felt like god (who I then believed in) had messed up by making me a boy when I should have been a girl. I can remember asking god if I could spend even one day as a girl I would trade away the rest of my life for that one day. I never told anyone about that until about two years ago I told my long term 6+ year girlfriend how I have always felt I was born the wrong sex and she was very supportive. She isnt in the picture anymore because of unrelated reasons, so I'm back to basically being the only person in my life who knows how I really feel about myself.  I'm only attracted to women, so I guess I kind of wished I could have been a lesbian in what would have been my ideal reality. I have never had any personal desire to transition to female, even though I support people who want to and if it brings them happiness then I am truly happy for them, but for myself I think it would just make me feel even more outcast, I am very masculine looking and at this point I dont think any amount of surgery would ever make me feel outside like I've always wanted to be inside. I wish that I had told my father when I was a child how I felt, my dad has always been the only supportive loving person in my life, He doesnt know about this but I know he would have understood and maybe I could have been put on puberty blockers or something until I was old enough to decide, I think that would have been the only scenario I would have considered transitioning. As it stands now though I already hate being alone and have always kind of hated who I am, the best I am currently hoping for is to find love with a woman who will accept me for who I am, on the one hand alot of the women I have been with have ended up really falling for me, especially before I started admitting to myself about my identity issues, I think due to how I tend to be very sensitive and deeply emotional in relationships but on the other hand its harder to find someone accepting of my sexual needs and desires that I attribute to my gender identity, I really enjoy getting to be submissive to the women I'm with and receiving anal play from them, and there is a stigma about guys receiving anal as being gay which is unfortunately thought by a lot of people, even though for me its been a sexual act that allows me to fantasize about getting to receive penetrative sex as a woman, its the closest I have ever come to sexually feeling feminine. \n\nI read once something along the lines of sometimes during pregnancy the fetus is supposed to be female but can sometimes change to male at the last moment from trauma or drugs or other factors during the pregnancy, leading to it being born a male with higher then normal estrogen levels. I've always had low testosterone levels and my birth mother had drug problems so I kind of suspect that maybe might have been the case with me. I have no way to know that for certain besides the feeling that I was supposed to have been born differently. All I know is I've never felt like I was living the right life, and I wish I could have grown up as a girl, getting to feel pretty, getting asked to dances, discovering being more attracted to other women, getting to experience bearing a child. I dont really know what my point here is, just needed to say some stuff even if no one reads its. It just sucks to feel like this, it has made most of the joy in my life seem pretty hollow when I've always known I would have grown up loving myself and happy with life if only one chromosome had been different...

One of my best friends is trans, he came out about four years ago. Since then, he goes by his new name and all of his friends are really supportive, which is great. Problem is, his parents are in full denial. They only call him by his birth name, won't look into the topic at all and avoid talking about it. We all try our best to support him as effectively as possible, but of course the situation with his parents weights him down a lot and lately his depression, anxiety and dismorphia have been getting worse and worse and it breaks my heart.\n\nWe've talked about how badly he wants to start HRT once but then never again because he hates that topic - he describes it as a dream that'll never come true anyway and is just too depressing to even think about. Like seeing that one bright thing that you want more than anything else in life but it's completely out of reach. \n\nAnd that's the thing, because I don't really see why it'd be impossible. He's of age and I've looked into it and here in Germany, health insurance would absorb the costs, the only thing he needs is an affirmation from his psychiatrist and a few general health checks and stuff. He wouldn't even have to discuss it with his parents and wouldn't need their approval either.\n\nI think the point that keeps him from going through with HRT is that he doesn't want to \"disappoint\" his parents and family and he's scared of how a transition would affect their relationship. I completely understand that because their relationship has been really good up until his outing and he still loves them - while they love their \"daughter\" and he's scared of rejection. \n\nBut it's become more and more obvious that he can't keep going like this either and I'm really worried about him. Does anyone know how to handle a situation like this and how I could carefully talk to him about how this is solely his choice and his life and stuff without invading his space and making him uncomfortable and depressed?

When I look at my reflection- it is a reflection of me. The problem is I really don't enjoy being female.\n\nI have always been a tomboy, never wanted to do anything that's particularly girly except maybe going through a phase of loving horses. I loved the outdoors, sports and video games, growing up I was simply a girl that liked to do things that boys typically do- which is completely normal. \n\nMy parents might have been a little reserved but they never forced me to be something I'm not if it made me unhappy. They let me quit ballet when I used to cry about doing it every day and even let me join a mixed football team instead so long as I was doing something active they were fine with it. They cheered me on at sports and bought me football shirts and videogames for my birthday.  \n\nIt wasn't until I was older that I realized my gender was starting to hold me back from doing the things I loved. My best friends who I played football went on to play for their school and I couldn't go with them. The school didn't have a girls football team. (Football meaning soccer- I'm from Europe.) I played field hockey instead and got pretty good at it even though I didn't enjoy is so much. \n\nPeople were always surprised when I got A's in Chemistry and Math- asking me if I was sure I wanted to take such 'hard' subjects. They commented that as a girl I should really have neater writing. Even now in university people are asking me if Computer Science is what I want to pursue. I hate that I'm not as strong as a man so I can't perform sports as well/have to train 5 times as hard to get to the same level. I really hate that people see me as someone who has to have a child at some point. Getting pregnant terrifies me I don't want to give up my career or hobbies and then have to look after a kid full time stuck at home. Because of that I'm not sure I even want a kid.\n\nI don't like that I'm sometimes afraid to speak my mind or crack a joke as people don't seem to respond to it as well if it comes from a female. I hate that when physical shit needs to be done like hauling boats up a beach or unpacking a van well natured family and friends tell me to stand back while they do the heavy lifting (often for objects that aren't even heavy) I'm kind of fed up of being the weaker sex.

Buuuuuut. Being not out to anyone means the internet is my only avenue for assistance. I\u2019m about 6 weeks into my trans journey and in some ways I\u2019ve been rocketing down this life-road with the gas pedal glued firmly to the floor, I am not exaggerating to say that reading about trans things has consumed 90% of my free time in the last month and a half. Yet, so much I don\u2019t know, and in other ways i\u2019m still recently hatched. But my current conundrum or block to progress is this:\n\n1) I know I want to be a woman.\n\n2) I don\u2019t think I am a woman.\n\n3) I don\u2019t know if I can become a woman.\n\nI can still call myself trans because that first one is very strong. I want to be a woman badly. In my life I have very rarely cared deeply about anything or desired/wanted things, physical or otherwise. But even in my more despairing moments if I ask myself if I still want this, the answer is always a strong yes. This answer is also why I think i\u2019m mtf and not nb\n\nThe second point is mostly where I want opinions. As strongly as I want to be a woman, I don\u2019t feel like I am or have ever been a woman deep inside. To be fair, i don\u2019t particularly feel like man either and I\u2019m still kinda resentful of masculinity as a general concept.\n\nSo my main question is for those of you who have been on this path longer than I have, how much does #2 change over time? Do you start to feel more and more like you are your gender? It seems like most people started by saying \u201cI am &lt;gender&gt;\u201d (#2) and then had to struggle to accept \u201cI want to be &lt;gender&gt;\u201d (#1) for themselves, and i\u2019m just backwards. But this might just be the standard narrative and it\u2019s not actually how most people experience their gender transition. I don\u2019t know.\n\nAnd #3 is mostly that when I do fem things like lipstick or clothing, it doesn\u2019t make me feel like more of a lady. It doesn\u2019t help #2. I do sometimes get strong emotional reactions to a bra or a dress, so something\u2019s certainly happening deep in the back of my skull, but it's mostly crying and frustration and not affirming feelings.\n\nSo, dear internet, on the scale of one cat to all the cats. Please tell me if this is reasonably typical.\n\n**EDIT:**\nOK. I was apparently just Googling things in the wrong way, and I found some posts talking about exactly this 'want vs am' problem, and they're also saying that this is super common...\n\nI don't want do delete this post, but [see the comments here](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/715e15/mtf_i_dont_feel_like_a_woman_but_rather_that_i/)", "date": "2018-02-16 03:06:19", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7xvvv6/the_want_vs_am_vs_can_be_problem/", "author": "pastelfetish"}, {"title": "Important question: once and for all, are traps gay?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-02-16 07:25:27", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7xx67o/important_question_once_and_for_all_are_traps_gay/", "author": "DamnDatAssSoFine"}, {"title": "Forever in the closet.", "text": "Soooo to try and make this short.

Because in her oldies singing club today, a trans lady came in and sang a song on her guitar, etc. and my mum said that driving nan home in the car, she said \"We had someone in playing the guitar today, but you know, I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!\" Mum took a deep breath, and said \"Yes, it was a woman, she's transgender.\" \"What's that?\" \"Well, she used to be a boy, but she took hormones, surgery and now she lives as a woman.\" (Simplified and possibly inaccurate version I know) \"Gosh, well I've never heard of that before\".

I've spent so much time on vocal training thst my voice is indistinguishable from that of a cis woman's, in fact I'm in the higher ranges. My partner has a naturally higher voice (she is cis), and we've had people tell us thst she and I sound a lot alike, almost indistinguishable. It just takes time and methodology and constant practice.\n\nWhat you're aiming for is to change where your voice resonates from. Most men, and those of us who were assigned male at birth, have resonance points in our chest. Women, and those assigned female at birth, typically have higher resonance points, somewhere between the clavicle and nose. I currently sit somewhere around my lower jaw/upper neck. You can feel this if you put your hands on your chest and neck (2 fingers works just fine, you don't need to use your whole hand. No need to choke yourself here (leave that for the bedroom if that's what you're into \ud83d\ude09)\n\nWhat I recommend is thst you sing along to higher pitched artists (I admit, I started off with Cher, who is very low in vocal range, but I moved up to Ruth B., Kate Voegle, Sarah Berelias, and even Jasmin Thompson).\n\nI also recommend that you watch the videos on trans voice 101 by Stef Sanjati on youtube. ~~I don't have the links handy right this second~~, but her older one is the one I used to train my voice.\n\n[old video](https://youtu.be/q6eTvS2wIUc)\n\n[newer video](https://youtu.be/Ah5DGHXbKmk)\n\nI also practiced every waking moment, and I work as the main cashier in a very busy retail bookstore in the south/eastern part of the US. It took time, and not everyone was so supportive of me doing so, but that just fueled my determination. Within 2-3 months I was within normal female range all the time. After 6 months I discovered it was difficult to drop back down at all and speaking with my feminine voice was incredibly natural to me. And now, at a year and a half of self taught vocal training, it's really really difficult to drop, and I can't even get all the way back down. \n\nIt's also very important to remember to breath properly and not sound nasally, or overly valley-girl. Just talk like the cis women around you. Pay attention to how they speak.\n\nI do think it's worth noting that if you use someone who has a different accent than you do as a model for your voice that you could develop some words that are within that verbal accent. Because of that I say Sorry like a Canadian, Water like I'm from the UK, and a few others. You can train yourself out of it, or just enjoy the little quirks  (like I do).\n\nI will be putting the links up shortly. I've received several messages in the past asking how I got to wear I am, and I am always willing to video chat, or just talk on discord, with any of you.\n\nThe changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change. Record a short video of you speaking, and then every couple of months record another one. You will be surprised the differences when compared month to month rather than day to day. This also helps you identify what aspect of your voice you should work on. Feel free to discontinue whenever you feel comfortable. \n\n**Now for trans men**. I recommend all the steps above but in reverse. You want a lower resonance point, and I recommend singing a long to some deeper pitched artists (start with Ruth B and Cher, and work your way down to some of the deeper male artists like George Ezra or Garth Brooks.)\n\nI admit, I have little experience with this, but it stands to reason (in my mind) that the same can be achieved by doing the exact opposite. You guys also have the added benifet that hormones WILL help with this. It takes time. The changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change.

So in my case I was born male, am comfortable as male.  Suddenly I wake up female (sex), but I am male (gender), and have always been male (gender).  Could the feelings that would ensue (i.e., feeling out of touch with who I am, knowing I am male in a female body) in this hypothetical scenario help a person understand at all?\n\nNow, like I said I struggle to understand and get things right sometimes. So I hope I haven't confused my use of sex and gender, and I hope nothing about my attempt to find a way to help people who aren't trans understand is found offensive.

I just figured my body hatred was an inherent part of being female.\n\nI met a man and fell in love (another reason why I felt as though I wasn't trans; my sexuality) and the two of us had a baby. Happy family! Except after I gave birth I started to hate myself even more than before.  I thought having a baby would make me finally feel comfortable in my lady body, but in reality, I never felt more out of place. I fell into a deep depression, knowing I could never embody the classic \"motherly\" characteristics all of my other mom friends had. \n\nA few months ago in my Social Problems class, we discussed the topic of transgenderism. The super progressive and intelligent professor explained it in a way that somehow made it finally click: I'm trans. I'm absolutely trans. I'm 100% positive. And its wonderful! Finally I understand why I feel so out of place in the world!\n\n...Except, its not wonderful. Because I'm the wife of a straight cis man and the mother of his child. We're your picture perfect nuclear family. So what do I do?\n\nWell, I came out to him. I told him in the calmest, most mature way I possibly could. I explained everything to him, and he actually seemed to understand. Hes known about my depression and I've spoken before about my more masculine desires. He admitted he could not be with me if I were to fully transition, which hurt, but I'm understanding of because you can't help or change your sexuality. Other than that, he said I can do what I want and he won't love me any less.\n\nSo seeing that he seemed alright with it, I was even more happy! I cut my hair (not drastically, about 6 inches from shoulder length to a pixie-bob sort of thing) and started dressing *slightly* more masculine. Not all the time, just when I went to school or out running errands without him. I didn't ask him to refer to me with male pronouns or call me his boyfriend or anything (though twice we've had sex and he referred to me as his boy without me asking). Basically, it all seemed good for the last few weeks.\n\nBut this week, he's been distant and kind of cold. Won't look at me. Won't kiss me. Just giving me this disappointed sad face anytime we make eye contact. When I confronted him on this, he told me he felt as though our relationship is a train, and I've hijacked it and am now holding him and our son hostage. Basically saying in the most terrible, blunt way possible that he feels like I'm forcing this all on him without compromising or anything.\n\nTHAT hurt. When I came out I cried, I've told him multiple times that I don't want him to be uncomfortable, that I'm just trying to hate myself less, and I'm not even dressing masculine around him. Yet still, somehow he's come to the conclusion that I'm holding a gun to his head and telling him to accept all of this or I'll shoot. Is it wrong to want your partner's acceptance?\n\nI don't want to transition. It's expensive and socially rough to deal with, and I don't want my son to suffer any unintended consequences. I don't want to give up my status as a wife or a mother. All I'm trying to do is present as male in social situations and to myself. I want to look in the mirror and be happy with what I see. And so far, presenting as male has done just that. \n\nToday I tried presenting as female again to appease him. It hurt. I felt naked and wrong. I want to dress masculine again but I'm afraid to lose my husband in the process of becoming myself. But if I keep trying to play it off like I'm a girl knowing what I know now, I'm only going to feel more disgusted with myself. All I want right now is someone who understands what this feels like, because I know there's no right answer.\n\nTL;DR: Oops, sorry, your wife is a man!

This doesn't really pertain to my argument, but I figured I'd get it out of the way.\n\nA question that I've had for a while, that has continued to plague me the more I think about it, relates to the validity of the transgender movement as a whole. I have yet to actually meet any trans people in person who I've had an opportunity to really sit down with since I started considering the matter, and I figured I might reach out online to find people's opinions.\n\nEssentially, my question boils down to this:\n\n*What is the point of gender?*\n\nI suppose I should start by defining my terms. By gender I mean the social and personal perception of being a man or a woman, and I view it as mostly constructed of two components: the social perception of your gender (essentially stereotypes, presumptions, and pronouns), and the biological component, being genitalia, hormones, breasts, etc.\n\nMy perspective originated with looking at myself and noting the obvious femininity (which I consider different to female-ness, but I'll get to that later) mixed with some masculinity, and realising that my gender (seemingly) played 0 role in my self perception/self worth, etc. (I suppose this might not be the case for everyone, and this is something I find very interesting about transgenderism, as it seems like one of the rare cases where people talk about this being important) Once I started looking at how the distinctions based on gender society creates flounder when faced by transgenderism (consider the MtF soccer player who, despite having man-strength, plays the womans league), I came to the conclusion that it's just not a wholly accurate representation of anything about a person. Sure, the top men are all stronger than the top women, but for the average, men and women are all functionally identical, falling within 1 standard deviation of each other in every trait. (that's not actually a backed up point, I heard it somewhere, and whether or not it's strictly true, the argument still stands).\n\nSure, it's useful to look at someone, see that they're female, and be able to gauge a whole gamut of traits, but time after time people just aren't fitting into it in the modern day. Most people, probably at least 60-80% are cis-gendered and straight, but for the rest of us, we're still a significant portion. I think that everyone has some blend of masculinity and femininity. Distinctions of female and male seemingly effectively enforce the this requirement of \"men must be masculine\" and \"females must be feminine\" without, by sheer statistical anomaly, everyone fitting in.\n\nGender, as I said, seems to come down to the social aspect, and the biological aspect. The social aspect, as a society, we're getting over. We're realising that dictating how someone should behave based off of gender is dumb. And the biological aspect, as I mentioned earlier, whilst significant over the population, in terms of the individual, isn't the whole picture for any trait, and for 90% of the populous, there are people of the opposite sex who are more masculine and people more feminine than they are. Furthermore, with advances in science, the biological sex of a person will soon no longer be fixed. This seems to invalidate the worth of gender as a construct entirely.\n\nNow, as for how my question pertains to the trans community:\n\n*By redifining your gender (where it doesn't seem to fit as, say, a male) to a female what exactly are you changing? And by doing so, do you worry that you're still defining yourself by the rubric of genders as enforced by society, which have been demonstrated to be flawed time and time again?*\n\nI worry at times that transgenderism is essentially just observing the stereotypes that exist for the opposite gender and feeling that they would apply better to you.\n\nI worry that transgenderism involves a changing of the self to fit gender stereotypes, any gender stereotypes, no matter their source.\n\nI worry that transgenderism, whilst easier to explain to a cis gender than agenderism, is propping up the frankly antiquated notion of gender as an idea.\n\nI don't see the point.\n\nPlease share with me your thoughts!

The first was when I first hatched out of my egg.\n\nThe dysphoria hit so hard and I couldn\u2019t *not* think about it. So, I recklessly attempted suicide because I was afraid of coming out to my parents. I didn\u2019t succeed, but I was forced to come out to them at the mental hospital I was transferred to. They respond need lime expected, and I found myself in a faith-based rehab center for the next three months.\n\nDuring that time, the idea that I was a girl persisted. In my first two weeks, I found a friend, and came out to them through a note because I knew I could trust them. Well, he was able to leave the center the next week, and apparently they found my note and I got into a lot of trouble.\n\nAfter that, I had to suppress all of those feelings for the rest of the stay. In fact, it kinda disappeared a bit\u2014if not completely. I still thought of myself as a girl, but I didn\u2019t let it get to me too much.\n\nBy the end of my stay, I had to tell my parents that I wasn\u2019t a girl in order to leave, so I did. After I left, I actually thought it *was* all a phase. That I was just caught up in some emotional wave of confusion or something.\n\nThe next year was spent without any phone or computer, and contestant monitoring from my parents. During this time, I can recall being EXTREMELY disassociated\u2014but no dysphoria at all. I wasn\u2019t a girl in my mind.\n\nEventually I got access to a computer. Then, I found myself on a group chat online and I began presenting myself as a girl there. For some reason, it was at that moment that all of that dysphoria cake crashing back into my body and mind. It felt like all the anxiety in the world had come to haunt me\u2014for what? Talking in a group chat? It was strange, and that feeling reminded me to be careful of this \u201cphase\u201d mentality. So, I stopped going on those group chats and my dysphoria went away again. \n\nI was busy with a job and school, so I didn\u2019t have time to think about that stuff.\n\nComing back to the present, it was only last week that I discovered all of these subreddits. And let me tell you: the dysphoria is fucking back, and worse than ever. Earlier today I was even contemplating suicide because I am so unsure of whether this is a phase or not.\n\nThe fact that I am only feeling this bad when I focus on trans stuff makes me think it *is* one very long phase. If it isn\u2019t a phase, then why am I not feeling dysphoric consistently?\n\nWhat does this mean? Honestly, the time I have spent on these subs is doing more harm than good, and I don\u2019t want to go down some rabbit hole only to find out I am not a girl and I just threw my social and family impressions out the window. This all may just be a weird way for me to rebel against my parents. \n\nTL;DR: I am afraid that this is just one, 2+ year phase because I seem to only feel dysphoric when thinking about being trans.

I've sorta felt that way for most of my life, doing things girls do anyway without thinking about it, but since January of 2017 I've known for sure this is what I want to do. I've been pretending to be a girl online instead, gradually coming out to the people I communicate with solely online (Easier than face to face, and they don't have to worry about my appearance between then and starting transition). In November I came out face to face with someone for the first time; my friend that I used to walk home with. She was 100% accepting and supportive enough that shes tried pushing me to just start displaying as a girl, to which I told her I'm aiming for the begining of next school year (Giving me all summer break to get used to it), which she accepted. Right after that, in October, I came out to my step mom, who is also very accepting, but she's sceptical about it. I've tried everything short of lying to her about how long I've known. The day after I told her, I received a 30 minute screaming session from my father. He only brought up the actual issue once, the rest was more drivel stroking his Respect Complex (A few days ago was the first time since then he actually brought it up, where he tried to say he understood what I was going through and that he supported me, which is good enough despite him obviously not knowing what I'm going through, or he'd be a woman). \n\nGood god I've put more work into writing that than my homework this week an- wait, when does the preface end?

It's late and I'm basically crying right now, I'm not sure what I'm typing...\n\nI've been trying to set up an opportunity for me to go out with a friend and have them dress me up as a girl so I can feel any relief from this, but I've either chickened out cause I think I'm too much of an atrocity to ever look remotely like a woman, or because I'm just too depressed to just even do anything. It's especially harder because my parents think they need every single last little minute detail of what I'm doing if I'm not at home, and I don't know that I want to tell them that's what I'm doing cause I don't know how they'll feel about it.\n\nAnd the reason I'm not doing all this complaining to my friends is I don't want to bug them. The friend that originally offered to take me out is somewhere around \"Popular\" status and lives a few towns away from me, so I don't want to take up her time... and money. Christ clothes are expensive...\n\nI think I'm just gonna post this as it is and just reply to comments as they come (Time to pray I didn't hit any character limit)\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nUpdate: I'll probably be going shopping for proper clothing on my birthday, wish me luck", "date": "2018-03-15 07:32:37", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/84kow6/thought_dump_i_guess/", "author": "MMad_47"}, {"title": "How do I explain to my family that I like wearing girls underwear....without it being weird?", "text": "My family is EXTREMELY transphobic.

I would always imagine being the girl if I was watching any porn or having sex. It was the only way for me to feel right and orgasm. \nFast forward some 10 years and countless ill fitting panties, clothing and an even more desire to be what I imagined in my head I would feel. Enter my Rave days. I never thought I would see the light. I could be me and dress how I wanted and no one judged. Party kids, transgender party kids all of the alphabet. I loved that time. \nI never felt threatened or hit on. I was me. Dancing full girl mode and never had an issue. \nI miss those days and the feeling have never faded. \nAnyway, now that I got side tracked. Here I am married with kids and finally came to the realization life is to short to not live how you want to. This has been for over 5 years now and I have ditched my male things and ways to be more fem. Clothes, undies, makeup, shaving the whole experience. The learning process has been crazy hit or miss. \nBetween a drawer full of panties that maybe 5 fit perfect to scratching my head over female clothing sizes. That shit is all over the place. \nLiving full time I have come to see that the struggles that females go through are real. I have so much more respect for them and my wife. I have remorse for some things I did early on in life and how I treated some females as objects. \nWell, I contacted a therapist for some counseling. I really do not want grs but an orchi due to testicular cancer running in my family and killing my father. My wife supports this and understands. I know I can also legally change my name and asked her to pick one out. I also asked her if she would remarry me. I would take her maiden name and it would be very special to me to be her wife. \nI bought a wedding dress and some stuff for the big day that I hope comes soon. We discussed doing our wedding like our original but as wife and wife. Just her and I. \nI don't know where all this may lead but I can say I am so happy that I told her years ago how I felt and I am in debt to her because she accepts me for the female I am. \nHopefully in a few months or maybe a year I will  be her wife and walking down the beach in my gown saying I do. \nI know this has been choppy but I wanted to try and keep it as short as possible. \n\nLove,\nHeather Renee  (Rea)\n ", "date": "2018-03-17 12:18:33", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/853dzn/finally_decided_to_start_full_time_transition/", "author": "heatherNicole1208"}, {"title": "[NSFW] Call for nudes!

Ever since then I've been feeling guilty of wanting to transition and come out to my family. Right now it is easy for me to hide everything from them as my family and I live in different countries. I feel guilty because I am the only child in my whole big family (grandpa, mom, dad, dad's brother and his wife, dad'sister and her husband). They have worked very hard throughout their whole lives to reach where they are now and have worked hard for me too to send me to a foreign country for my studies. Even though I have pretty much taken care of myself (both funancially and physically) since i was 17, I still feel that I am crushing their hopes and dreams by wanting to transition. I want all of them to have a relaxed and happy old age because they deserve it and I feel that if I transition it will not be the case for them. All their hopes are literally in 1 basket (me). I will definitely pay off all the money they spent for me to be here (already halfway through) but I want to do a lot more than that for them. \nThey definitely will not understand me being trans and will be SERIOUSLY dissapointed. My parents will either disown me or be very angry or go into kind of hopeless depression and I do not want to be the cause of that. They have done a lot for me and I want to return a lot more than what they have done. I do not feel obligated; I sincerely want to make their old age as relaxed as possible and I know that if I transition or even come out it will be bad for them. But at the same time I feel that I need to transition too. I already regret that I didnt \"find myself\" earlier and did not start transitioning. Both these needs are equal to me (transitioning outweighs other by a little from time to time) but I know that doing one will not let me do the other. Other being setting up a peaceful retirement for my family.\nI'm really really confused about what to do. I want ti start transition now at least the hrt and the surgeries can wait a couple of years; but, I do not want to disappoint my family either especially after everything they've done for me. \n\nThanks in advance fir the help! \u263a\nXO", "date": "2018-03-20 23:45:21", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/85xm82/should_i_come_out/", "author": "coconutballoon"}, {"title": "is anyone here from chile?", "text": "planning to go there (for an extended period of time) and hoping to find someone trans who i can talk to or more about what to expect. not a lot of information on the internet .__.''

People online told me that i would feel nothing upon taking them, in a few weeks I would know if it was for me somehow (they didn't exactly clarify), and that slowly over months i would have some changes to my body.\n\nSo I was extremely worried about if they would let me have HRT, I asked lots of questions about peoples process of getting it, most refused to comment on the subject which I found odd, most just said I would have likely a 2 hour conversation on the ins and outs of HRT, they would have me sign tons of paperwork, and draw my blood.\n\nSo that's kind of what I was lead to believe for getting HRT. I found a doctor and since no one would clarify on the questions I might get or anything, I decided to go full fem, to increase my chances. Well the doctor asked me If I went to therapy (which I said no for personal reasons), If I was a woman (which of course yes), and what my sexuality was (Pansexual). The nurse before hand had also asked me if I was on birth control (which was a no). So the doctor tells me he will give me pills (Spironolactone and Estradoil) and sends me to get my blood drawn. People online mentioned I needed my hormones checked beforehand, so i called and asked if they were checking that and they informed me thy don't do that until later. 2 weeks later He said my blood pressure was a little high, probably because I was scared but everything else was normal, then I got my HRT.\n\nSo, I received 50mg Spironolactone and 1mg Estradoil pills, to be taken twice a day. He had informed me upon getting them for the first week to only take the morning dosages so my body could adjust to it. The pills were incredibly tiny and I expected little to not results since I was 25.\n\nUpon taking them i felt nothing, then I checked my phone 45 minutes had passed, and suddenly I am hit with vertigo, almost fell to the ground, felt like dysphoria lessened, my mind expanded and got all soft and airy, my nose cleared up, and my skin was pinching in pain everywhere. It all just hit me at once. My body was in physical pain from it and I had just had to steady myself back to standing, so I freaked. I called my doctor and he refused to come to the phone but the nurses said it was normal. I couldn't find anyone online who had similar so I was a bit scared. That pain lasted for 2 days on it. Then things started to get worse.\n\nI would take the pills and immediately my nipples would be sore, on top of this sometimes my wrists would cramp up so badly I would almost scream in pain, within a minute of taking it i was having painful reactions. 5 to 10 minutes later I would get vertigo, and this stabbing throbbing pain in my limbs, felt like they wanted to explode, was so painful I couldn't walk for a bit and thought I was dying. About a month in I had hip joint pain where I couldn't walk on my leg because my joint felt like it had this crunching pain, both my hip joints had this and popped.\n\nA few months in i had nipple lactation and some people said that was normal, others said cancer, and others still hormone imbalance. i also had major hot flashes which again some said was normal or a hormone imbalance but those went away after a few months. My boobs never really hurt aside from a few armpit twinges and nipple soreness which only hurt when touched or for those first few months right after taking hrt, even then it was on par with a bruise. Most people complain about boob pain so no idea. I later on got progesterone and within seconds I had lactation and my nipples would become either hard or soft, had someone else witness it, so I know it isn't in my head, and I certainly wasn't expecting it.\n\nAt about a year in I started to have period symptoms, well noticeable ones anyways. Many people argue If this is even possible, I am not sure, but I will explain what happens to me. So I have a cycle of around every 28 days, where for 7 days I will get a variety of symptoms. It starts out with me getting a slight sore throat and my skin getting a bit softer a day or two in advance. Then day 1 starts and I get bloating, muscle cramps, headache, nausia, headfog, hotflashes, breast increase, all my strength sapped, mood swings, full on sore throat, I get a lot more tired, my skin gets softer, my skin is more sensitive and my immune system gets noticeably lower (I get sick only like once a year and now its every few months just after a monthly). i have had other people verify the cramping, hot flashes, bloating, skin softness/sensitivity, as well as them notice the other symptoms though they can't exactly verify those.\n\nI am currently 19 months in, D cups, my hips sway when I walk, my hands shrank, as well as my feet, and so far I have lost 2.5 inches on my height.\n\nI have been told by many people all of this isn't possible, some say it is, and other claim it is from other things. Some say hormone imbalance, others say intersex, others say flat out impossible the meds need more time to enter your system, been told the hand in feet shrinkage might be due to less cartilage and ligaments.\n\nI am just laying out what has happened to me, no idea how or why any of it is possible, but yeah I am lost with what is within the realm of normal and what is not, for HRT. My doctors have explained nothing to me, in terms of what is normal for HRT. After I got on it I started hearing people talking about how they made transition plans with their doctors and how their doctor had long conversations with them about how it all works and I have had none of it.

The gist is as follows - I've been identifying as a trans girl for a couple of years by now (since 2015 to be specific), but am still in the closet, so to speak. Offline, at the very least (I already shared that with a couple of people I know online that I know I'll never meet anyways). But the thing is, spend too much time with the knowledge that you're trans, and you kind of want to let somebody close to you know. I've got one such a friend, a girl I've known for a bit more than half my life (met when we were 10, we're 24 now). But... well, I keep chickening out. \n\nI do trust her completely, but the thought that there is an extremely small chance she could still reject me kind of paralyzes me every time I think about it (since she's the one friend I definitely do NOT want to lose). Sometimes I ask \"Could we talk later?\" only for me to say that I just wanted to vent a little and already found somebody else by the point she manages to find some time in between her studies. And I know that even if I'd actually talk to her, well... I kind of fear that I wouldn't really be able to explain my state of mind properly to her, considering that I'm fairly awkward with words when speaking to others, but definitely do want her to understand.\n\nSo I've been thinking a little bit how to work around that, and figured - okay, maybe I could at least try to lay out some hints for her and gauge how she responds to those first. You know, to see whether the response would be favorable, not so much, or whether she cares about that kind of stuff in the first place. I unfortunately have to admit though - I haven't the faintest clue on how exactly to do that. I don't want to be too on the nose about that, after all. Which brings me to the point of this whole post - does anybody have some advice in regards to that, even if it's only something small? Ideas on how I could poke her in that regards or break the ice somehow?", "date": "2018-03-24 15:19:19", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/86tnrm/advice_in_regards_to_coming_out/", "author": "HitsuWTG"}, {"title": "I feel great :D", "text": "", "date": "2018-03-24 15:31:17", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/86tqj2/i_feel_great_d/", "author": "EmperorMarcus"}, {"title": "Xpost r/TransDIY please help!

Or maybe I am just over-complicating it.\n\nFirstly, I am with a dude who is straight. Totally love him, been together 7 years. He was the one who helped me figure out that I was Gender nonconforming, and then later that I was Trans*. So he's pretty open minded and cool like that. Secondly, I am, like I said, Trans*. And have been fighting with the idea of transitioning.\n\nThe problem I am dealing with that is concerning is that my Fiance identifies as cis and straight. He has been having a hard time coming to terms with the idea that while I do have a vagina, I am not a female. I mean he isn't against it, but more like a bit uncomfortable.\n\nWe have talked about the possibility of me transitioning vaguely, and he has openly said that he doesn't think he would be able to be with me if I am on T and am fully transitioning. But we have talked and kind of compromised, because taking hormones of any type have a bad habit of make me physically ill, so no T. And instead of full top surgery, maybe just a breast reduction from a DDD to a B or C. And absolutely no bottom surgery.\n\nBut, I don't know. Part of me would like to get on T even if it makes me sick because I have major self conscious issues with my voice. Like I'm okay with not growing extra body hair, because I find it gross anyway, and the other potential issues are like, whatever. But I have legit panic attacks (I have anxiety and depression so that doesn't help either) when I hear the sound of my own voice. And I really would like a more masculine looking body because I am very curvy. I have a huge amount of friends who keep low-key shaming me for having what they call the ideal feminine body type, but I don't want it. And they keep trying to make me feel bad for \"wasting\" the looks I was given.\n\nI am honestly not sure how to handle it or talk with him about it. It's not like he'll wake up one day and realize he is gay, and I don't know how to deal with all of the stress my friends keep putting on me so, does anyone have any advice?", "date": "2018-03-24 19:55:58", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/86vix0/trans_with_a_straight_fiance/", "author": "CottonClover"}, {"title": "The name question", "text": "I have at least informally changed my name with some of my friends, but I have been struggling with the idea of changing it legally.\n\nThe main reason against the legal name change is because my legal name means so much to my mother.

An accident, but a miracle.\n\nNow jump 22 year later, and I have figured that I am Trans* at this point and my friends have been calling me by a gender neutral nickname based on my birth name since I was 8 years old, so for 14 years. But I asked several of them who were open minded to call me by a masculine name and they were cool with it, and then I introduced myself by that name in college, so everyone at the college I go to calls me that now that I'm 28. Everyone except my friends from back home, and my birth family who all refuse to acknowledge it. This includes my mom who pretends that I never came out, but has openly told me that I am not allowed to go to the men's section while shopping with her, when she had no issues with this before I came out.\n\nAnyway, I am going on a tangent.

I'm happy, but I've been going through old pictures with family (and just generally sorting and scrubbing my files so deadme doesn't come up at a bad moment if/when I finally go stealth) and I wonder about the ones with me in them. I feel so far removed from that person now, but I'm having trouble figuring out if the person I am moving towards is who I really want to be. I was more consistently happy before when I hadn't alienated myself from all my family and former friends, but if I chose to detransition (if that's the correct term) I don't know that I would be able to do it in a way that makes everyone happy. I don't think I could ever stop hormones. I guess you could say that I have a psychological addiction to them. I like looking physically feminine. But does that mean I'm trans, or am I just effeminate and in denial about that?\n\nWhen my family deadnames me, it makes me really angry. Misgendering does not bother me as much, just because it's happened to me before and I understand that it can be confusing for people initially. They do both intentionally though, because they do not believe in transgender people. I have tried so hard to compromise for them, I originally tried to be androgynous, even chose an androgynous name, and I do tend to lean that direction, but it's not good enough. I'm not good enough.\n\nHow I've chosen to identify is still confusing for me, and I often misgender myself in my head, which makes me concerned sometimes that I'm not trans. It happens more often when I think of who I used to be, or my old name, which thankfully does not come up as often as before now that I'm legal. When I think of myself now I almost feel genderless. Gender does become somewhat irrelevant when you walk through life with blinders on because you're afraid of every person's reaction to you. The obvious solution is not to care so much, but it's easier said than done. My mind kind of defaults to anxiety and it feels impossible to stop. The more you think about it, the more self conscious you get, the worse it gets. Don't think about the Game. Anyway...\n\nI'm really self conscious about how I act a lot of times, and it makes me a really anxious person. I especially seek approval from the women at my job, but at the same time I feel like I've made myself an outsider to those who knew me before. It's different and much easier with people who have been hired since I started transitioning, but I also don't know them that well. There's a disproportionate amount of men at my job, especially on my team, and wandering the office is awkward because it makes me more self-conscious about my tuck, mainly because of the way it feels when I walk. It feels kinda gross. Some days it feels really gross because I've started electrolysis there... It's getting increasingly hard for me to go into work, and I've been working from home every other day as a result. I'm not a hermit, but if it weren't for church and grocery runs it's pretty close to it some weeks.\n\nI know people read this anxiousness, and it causes me not to pass as well (though physically I pass extremely well since VFS, even though I haven't had anything else done) and be a difficult person to be around. I feel like through this journey I've explored a different side of my personality I might have been suppressing, but know I'm not as femininely spirited as other women, even though I try (awkwardly) to present that way on the outside, and I beat myself up about it. Sometimes I feel like looking feminine is something I have to force myself to do. Don't get me wrong, I like the result, sometimes it just feels like such a chore. I'm absolutely horrible at accessorizing, partly because I don't really spend a lot of time at stores with good jewelry and bags, etc. I need to change my habits, but I'm almost afraid to. I'm very prone to getting stuck in familiar cycles. Ruts... This just happens to be the latest one. There's just added pressure now because there's so much I can and need to do since I got my name and letter updated. I plan to get a job with better insurance at some point so I can finish all this and get on with my life. I have thought about SRS (or whatever the trendy acronym is for it these days) for a while, and I definitely want it done at least for practical reasons, but also more than that. I won't get into too much detail because that's kind of a personal decision.\n\nI was watching an old Disney Channel movie about a girl who accidentally publishes her diary, \"Read It and Weep\" because I remembered really enjoying it when I was younger, and also that it was kind of girly. It's silly since most of the characters are significantly younger than I am, but I got really jealous of how well dressed the younger girls were.\n\nI worry sometimes that I won't be a good mom, or develop good motherly characteristics. I think that these characteristics are important especially if we're getting married (I'm still not sure about that) but even to be a good friend to my girlfriends who might have kids, and to fit into my role in the church, which I'm still not sure is supposed to look like. There aren't a lot of role differences described in the Bible (and many of them relate to roles within marriage), but they are there.\n\nSorry if this post was really rambly. I guess I'm not really looking for any specific input.

When I was young enough to take advantage of the clarity and serenity that I've only ever been able to grasp for brief moments of drug-fueled dissociation before this past month. I know regretting it isn't going to change it, and I know there's an astonishing number of wonderful people who only figured it out when they were twice my age, but I can't help feeling awful and I don't know how to move on.\n\nI'm terrified of what's to come. Even putting aside the risk of social ostracization (my job is very community-oriented, at that), the risk of hateful people destroying my body (which has happened to a family friend, even here in liberal country), the risk of medical complications, the risk of financial disaster (I was scraping by before I started looking into treatment), nothing in life has ever demanded so much sheer effort or commitment. I've never cared about anything like this transition, and the idea of actually having to work for something for the first time makes me wonder whether I even have the fortitude to do so. I care enough to put in the work...I think? I care enough that not knowing whether I do is crushing.\n\nFeeling anything at all is terrifying me. None of my self-abuse ever felt wrong or worth changing because I couldn't imagine a life worth living, but now that the door is open I'm actually hearing the insults I hurl at myself, and they actually hurt. I'm looking at my yellow-ass teeth that were never worth taking care of, and my bones that are creaking before their time. I'm looking at my empty savings, and looking back at the years of drugs and alcohol that burned through the money I could have put toward school or surgery or fucking anything that would have lasted. I can't stand what I've let myself become for the ignorance of what I could become, and it feels like the mistakes I've already made have ruined my potential.\n\nEven now that I'm finally doing electrolysis and vocal training and going to see a doctor about some skittles later this week, I'm just crushed by the injustice of being born this way. Life shouldn't have to be so goddamn hard, and as sure as I am that things are gonna get better and easier, and as patient as I know I need to be, and even though I know I'm doing everything right and I have everything going for me, I just want to hit the ground at mach 4 and be done ten years ago like I fucking could have.

I\u2019m 14 year old guy who is very confused and annoyed. I\u2019ve always been a pretty stereotypical boy, playing video games and such, but a few months ago after watching a video I started to wonder. Is there any chance I was transgender? Now, this hadn\u2019t even crossed my mind until then, and I feel like I\u2019m retry much okay with being a guy. I used to play house and such with girls during recess, but I was always a boy in them. I didn\u2019t play much with them after about fifth grade, when I made some more friends who were boys. Also, I\u2019ve enjoyed doing things with other guys since, but I\u2019m still good friends with most of the girls I knew. This might just be because I\u2019m in a small school but I don\u2019t know. Even so, the   only ever friends that were girls I had were them, and they weren\u2019t exactly considered the \u201cpopular girls.\u201d I was never amazing at sports and didn\u2019t play them often until now but I also like watching American Football on the TV. I am straight and find girls attractive, but the thing that really got me thinking was the fact that I enjoy cross dressing. It may not be on the way you think though. I don\u2019t get turned on or feel comforted by cross dressing, and it is very occasional( once every 1-2 months). I tend to just wear my own clothes, which are masculine, and just stuff some toilet paper to simulate fake breasts. It only last a few minutes at the most though, and I think it\u2019s more of a turn on thinking about doing it than actually doing it. Growth and transformation in general kind of turns me on, like the transformation stories or body expansion, like breast\u2019s. The expansion of the breasts is almost always in a women, which I usually imagine as my girlfriend or wife. Although I haven\u2019t actually ever had a girlfriend. When I was younger even until about 5 months ago I would sometimes stuff my crotch and pretend I was having sex while having a large penis, which also probably sounds odd. I don\u2019t have very many, if any, cases of gender dysphoria, but I might have some body dysphoria, as I am fairly skinny and wish I could be a bit bigger. I\u2019m also not very turned on by two people porn, but I don\u2019t really know why. I never really found the vagina to be extremely attractive, but the thought of sex with someone is pretty good. Although sometimes I feel like less of a man than some other guys as they\u2019re always talking about getting nudes or blowjobs. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do that now but I probably would once I got into an actual relationship. Maybe it\u2019s just paranoia because I don\u2019t have a very large penis and I might not be good for them, but I\u2019m also not very far along in puberty. I never really had any strong desires to become a woman, and I never feel bad when called a man or referred to as he. I feel like I may be just overthinking things and have a bit of paranoia or anxiety about it, and I kind of become distressed by the thought of be transgender. I\u2019m not sure that I really want to be transgender, as I am fairly happy in body, but I\u2019m still confused and want to know if I\u2019m just being kind of OCD about as it won\u2019t go off my mind.

Basically, I need advice on how to move forward because I feel really stuck. I don't know if I'm faking what I'm feeling or if it's actually real.\n\n\nI think everything started way back to when I started middle school. Since everyone in my grade had just moved into a new school, I decided to go along with what every other girl was doing and make myself really feminine and \"grown-up\", ignoring how much I absolutely hating how I looked in makeup and earrings and feminine clothes. This didn't last for long: I ended 8th grade wearing big t-shirts and jeans, and with debilitating social anxiety and depression. Fun! \n\n\nGoing into high school, for some reason I really really wanted to cut my hair short. I'd seen pictures of afab people with short haircuts on tumblr and really identified with it. Once the idea was in my mind, I really thought it would help my social anxiety even though I didn't know why. Sadly, my mother would only let me get it cut shoulder length and \"maybe get it cut shorter later in stages\". \nsidenote: Now almost 18, I FINALLY have the haircut I wanted at age 13.\n\n\nI started, almost obsessively, watching trans guys on youtube about halfway through high school (I'm a senior now), and found myself really connecting to them. Hearing their experiences made me wonder if the social disconnect and discomfort I had been feeling since I was about 12 had anything to do with gender identity, even though I had never thought of myself as being uncomfortable with my body.\n\n\nFast forward to about a year ago, I started to really dislike my chest. I would wear a jacket no matter how hot it got just to hide it. Again, I found solace in obsessively watching trans youtubers almost daily (I haven't stopped since lol), and as spring turned into summer and my depression worsened, that was pretty much the only thing I did. I found a way to flatten my chest using a camisole with elastic, and for the first time since getting my hair cut shorter I felt more confident in myself and my body (but also more anxious about hurting my ribs and about what I was feeling meant). This was when I started to question if I was a trans guy, or maybe nonbinary. I was positive I felt a disconnect from the terms \"girl\", \"woman\", etc.\n\n\nAs this new school year started, I absolutely hated myself. My mother forced me to wear makeup and clothes I was uncomfortable in for \"senior portraits\" despite my protests. I spent three hours at a photoshoot literally wanting to die from anxiety and discomfort at my body and appearance. Meanwhile, my depression was getting worse and worse, and questioning my gender identity was making everything harder. I really wanted to start dressing more masculinely but I was terrified to. Eventually, I found the confidence to buy a couple things from the mens section even with my mother disgusted at me for doing so, and bought some things from thrift stores to try out. With new clothes, a flatter chest, and finally getting the haircut I wanted, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MYSELF AND SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENT IT'S CRAZY! :D\n\n\nHowever, with all these new aesthetic changes I still don't really know how I feel about my gender identity. I REALLY don't think of myself as a \"girl\", and I'm surprised and uncomfortable when I realize people see me as one. I also realized recently that I'm So! Incredibly! JEALOUS! of cis guys, and I think I always have been even though I didn't connect the dots until now. I really wish I had a masculine chest and height and VOICE and mannerisms etc. I've been feeling more and more disconnected with my name and she/her pronouns too.\n\n\nBut at the same time I'm worried constantly if I'm faking all of these feelings and just.... I don't know. I'm always unsure of everything. I don't know how I'd feel with he/him pronouns or a new name. I'm just terrified and don't know what to think. I don't know if I'm trans, or non binary, or just stupid. I can't talk to anyone about this either, which really sucks. In general I'm just extremely terrified and unsure of the future and I don't know what to do next. \n\n\nDo you have any advice?

Up at around 13 i started questioning if i was genderfluid, because I had got a wig for halloween that was boy cut short. I wore it often and loved it. It felt so great taking on this male persona. I had never really been uncomfortable with my body, and as i said was rasied really girly with dresses and such. I tried forgetting all the genderfluid ideas afterwards. Soon after my 14 birthday i felt the feelings again, stronger this time. I had went with being Bigender this time. Because i felt kinda girly and boyish. I bought a chest binder to hide my chest it it felt good aswell. Around januray of this year i had became obessed with watching ftm transition videos, they made me happy and excited for some reason. Then i finally started identifying with trans. I cut my hair short and dressed masculine. I though, maybe im just a tomboy. Or maybe im a feminine boy. It felt great. I came out to my friends who called me he and him, they called me by my male name and everything seemed fine. Once i came out to my parents my mother outlashed at me saying how she wanted nothing to do with me when im older and is disgusted. She had seemed to slowly start accepting it more and said she would love me no matter what after she lashed out she would apologize. Everytime i ask for a gender therapist she wont get me one though. She seems to resent the idea of anything gender related with me. This is where the guilt comes in. Im afraid i will no longer look as i do in my baby photos and my family wont want anything to do with me. Im scared of how i will look and how it will affect my future. I want kids but i dont know if i want to be their mother or their father. Trying to find a label puts moe stress on me than ever but im desperate for closure or atleast reassurence. Im attracted to men as i said so that would make me gay. Ive always thought gay couples were way more cute and would so perfer having gay intercourse over straight. I dont really like my body but im not uncomfortable in it. Again though another bump in road because i started talking to my ex, when i talk to him i feel extrenely feminie and feelings come back for him. Maybe its because i dated him as a girl for 2 years and did really girly things to impress him. I dont know. I just remember some days waking up feeling really boyish and masculine. I even started marking down days i feel feminine and days i feel masculine. So far the only days i feel feminine is when i talk to him. I feel like the right path is transitioning but im scared, in denial, and having doubts. Its the future part and relationships that worry me. Any help? Im just confused as you might be. Also the more i hear female pronouns the more it feels weird. And after coming out i think i noticed more dysphoria because now in dresses i feel like a boy in a dress. Im on depression and anxiety medication but always still feel depressed an they even uped my dose. I always feel uncomfortable and out of place and awkward around others. If i could chose, i would want to be born male.

I'm 35. I'm amab, with a wife and a two-year-old kid. I've never felt like I really fit in with traditional masculinity, but never been dysphoric or depressed about my body either. Lately I've been thinking about gender and exploring it in some small ways-- painting my toenails, some feminine accessories, etc., but only when at home, or things that can be hidden.  (I'm in North Carolina, and my work community is really conservative and shitty.)\n\nFor about a year, I've been content just sticking it to gender norms in small ways like this, just a guy who's a little bit non-conforming. (I've had long hair in a ponytail for like twenty years, so that's not new for me I guess.) My wife has been supportive, and we've talked about going shopping for some skirts and whatnot for me, but we haven't done it yet. It didn't occur to me that I might be trans. \n\nThis is so stupid, but about a month or so ago, I had this chafing-nipples thing for a day or two, and it was really uncomfortable. When I complained about it to my wife, she said \"maybe you should try wearing a bra.\" And that's just nagged at me ever since, like, what if I did? What if I had boobs? I try to imagine that when I see myself in the mirror, and it feels weird and kind of... delirious? It's really hard to type this. Like, I'm so busy and we don't have really any money to speak of, but I just want to order some bras and skirts and panties, you know, just to see how that feels, maybe wear them and try to imagine how it would feel if my body had a different shape. \n\nI'm not reckless, I've had tattoo ideas for five or ten years that I've never actually gotten, because what if I made a change to my body, and then I wanted to go back to how it was? But part of me just wants to down a bunch of estrogen pills and see what happens to me, what I'd look like, who I'd turn into. I have never been great at keeping up with fashion or my appearance, but I think I'd be pretty. But I'm scared that, what if this is stupid and I would want to go back to how I am now. \n\nToday I've been reading a bunch in this subreddit, but I don't know. Most of these kinds of threads seem to be from people half my age or less. I thought I was old enough to have a solidified self-image, and sort of know who I am. This late in life, am I just confused?\n\nI've thought maybe I'm just a gender nonconforming dude, or maybe even non-binary. Never thought about telling anyone about that, not even my wife. But today I've been trying an experiment, where every time I look in the mirror, I silently tell myself: \"wow, you're a really beautiful woman,\" and it feels... nice? Terrifying, because what if anyone ever found out, but also really nice. And I've always been attracted to women, but today when I see really pretty women, part of me is silently thinking \"wow, I'm having lustful thoughts about you\" like usual, but also I'm noticing part of me is thinking, \"I really wish I had a dress like that one,\" or even, \"wow, I want to have tits like that.\" And it makes me feel a little creepy and weird and I look away so I'm not staring and making anyone uncomfortable. And I don't know if I'm objectifying people in inappropriate ways, or if I'm just a woman that's absorbed a lot of messed up ideas from society that I have to unlearn. \n\nAnd if I *am* trans, what do I do next? Everybody around here knows me with my male name, and I'm in a real male-dominated macho-shithead STEM field, and frankly I've always been pretty softhearted and collapse when criticized, and I don't want to deal with the backlash. Like, how long until you know for sure? What if it's something else, like maybe I'm just a crossdresser or something (sorry if that's not the right word, I don't know how to say things), or maybe I just need to tweak my gender expression a little harder and be \"that one dude with the painted fingernails\" or whatever. Or maybe this is a weird, temporary fixation and I'll just have to wait it out. I don't know. I don't want to do anything to make things confusing for my kid, and I don't know, maybe dada needs to stay just regular old dada for a little bit. \n\nI really don't know what to think, or even how to understand my situation.

I realized I was bi a little later. So before recently, I'd always been a really masculine person, and I had a lot of dysphoria. I would throw a fit if I had to wear a women's sweater. I didn't have all that much body dysphoria, but I hated it when I didn't pass as male. Having long hair made me want to crawl under a rock and never leave. I got my hair cut and feel a lot better.\n\nBut about a year ago I began to embrace my femininity. It's probably because I began to pass, and didn't feel like I had to constantly prove myself to be a guy anymore. Accepting my bisexuality played a part too, because before then, I was in a lot of denial. I went from not wanting anything to do with femininity and wearing the same ugly sweatshirt and baggy jeans each day, to being extremely feminine and putting way too much thought into my wardrobe so quickly. I don't mind wearing certain articles of women's clothing if I like it. I've found some awesome things in the women's section. As long as it doesn't prevent me from passing, I'll buy it. Sometimes my body will look really feminine, and I don't feel like I have a problem with it. Sometimes I'll look really feminine, but think I look good. My hips will be large, my chest won't be flat, but I don't feel much discomfort about it. But it still feels wrong when people refer to me as female. I now barely feel very dysphoric, even when I have plenty of reason to. My chest is no longer flat, my face is way more feminine, and sadly, I don't pass as often as I used to. I used to be able to wear a fucking women's swimsuit and people would still perceive me as male. Yeah, it was a swim shirt and board shorts, but it was still obviously women's swimwear. But now I can't pass often. And I don't really feel that bad about it. Sometimes it gets me down, but I guess I just don't think about it much.\n\nNow I'm having doubts about being trans. I went through the same thing last year. I'm just scared of the idea of growing out of this. I've fought so hard to be accepted, and it would suck so bad if this all ended up being a phase. Being ftm has definitely become a part of my identity, and I don't want to lose that. Sometimes I get nervous about the idea of medical transition. I don't want to be a big hairy guy (no offense to you big hairy guys out there). I don't want a super deep voice. I'd rather I had a voice that was kind of high pitched, but still distinguishable as male. Today I took a bunch of selfies, and I was passing really well. But for some reason it felt weird. I looked really masculine, and for some reason I didn't really like that? Idk. At least I looked photogenic in those selfies for once lol. I feel comfortable as the boy I am now, but I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of being a man. Lately the doubt has been getting a lot worse. I'm just really scared of possibly growing out of this. Being male has been a large part of my identity for my whole life, even before I realized I was trans. I just really don't want to lose that. I know it would be a lot easier just being a cis girl, but I'll feel like I've lost a huge part of my identity. But I don't want to go right on hormones and then end up regretting it later. I don't feel much body dysphoria. What if I go on T and start feeling dysphoric due to the changes? I went through the exact same thing last year. I had all these doubts and fears. I'm either just a really feminine guy, or a really masculine girl. Except I don't feel like I'm a masculine girl. I don't feel masculine, nor do I feel like a girl. I'm just so confused. How come I can look so feminine and not pass, and feel comfortable, and still be ftm? Sometimes I do feel dysphoric when my chest shows, but nothing extremely severe. I'm just so scared that I'm growing out of being trans, because I've become so ridiculously feminine over the years, and I've felt less and less dysphoria despite the fact that I really don't pass that well, not even to myself.

Fluctuating dysphoria?", "text": "So for the last month or so, I've really been lost on how I identify. I'm AFAB, but something about that never felt quite right. I always knew I was different from the girls I was made to be around, but I could never figure out just what it was. I was always my happiest around boys, in school, with my cousins, etc., but Around 4th or 5th grade I was getting bullied for being \"not like other girls,\" and I dedicated pretty much the rest of my life to trying to be as girly and feminine as I possibly could be. I alienated myself from everything related to boys and masculinity. \n\nFast forward, I'm a freshman in college. I've since made friends with people from all walks of life, reconnected with my guy friends from my past, whatever. \n\nI'm starting to question my identity, though. I've always felt uncomfortable with my body, and I realize that now. A sort of repressed memory resurfaced not too long ago, I was a little kid and just having an absolute panic attack about how I was getting breasts and how horrified I was at having to wear a bra and \"start being a woman.\" It felt so wrong. It still does. I always just wrote that off as \"puberty is weird for everyone, right?\" but that memory, along with so many others, are all starting to set off red flags and \"clicks\" in my head that something's been different all along.\n\nI had trans friends before, I just never thought to apply it to myself because I was still trying so hard to do my job of \"being a woman.\" But now that I'm considering that this is what I might be, I'm lost. It feels so right, and yet it also terrifies me, like I'm abandoning some part of me. \n\nI started keeping track of my feelings, documenting every single day for about a month now how I felt. For about a week straight, I'd feel like this, dysphoric, and then somewhere in between, for a day or two, it'd all be gone again, and during this time, I find myself saying things like, \"I'm being stupid; that was nothing; I'm just being influenced by others; I'm just lonely and I want a community to belong to, THAT's why I was being so weird, right?; What does gender even mean, why be worried about it?; I've always been somewhat ok with being a girl until now, why is it suddenly bothering me so much?; I like wearing girly clothes still, see?\" and I somehow talk down these feelings, and I feel like I'm \"comfortable\" again, and I don't mind being female as much. \n\nAnd then it just cycles back around, and I'm frustrated all over again. \n\nMind you, I grew up in a VERY anti lgbt household/family. And, my dad's always been one to talk down my feelings \\(related to other things, I haven't mentioned this to either of them.\\) I notice, though, that sometimes when I'm talking to myself like this, it's almost like his voice is my own; like I'm thinking like him. It's weird. \n\nIt might be internal transphobia. It might be me trying to tell myself the truth. It might be me lying to myself. I don't know what to believe anymore.\n\nI just want to know what's going on with me.

I'm trying to avoid typing a long paragraph so I'll just list off the reasons for this crisis.\n\n-When I was a kid, my brother and I would play pretend together &amp; often battle one another as our favorite superheroes.

I feel like I would have continued to do it had my older sister not shamed me for it. I didn't stop right away though, I would just do it in the mirror in the bathroom with the door locked but my dad walked in on me doing it once and shamed me, which is when I stopped altogether.\n\n-After becoming aware of my innate homosexuality as a teenager &amp; going through the whole denial / acceptance number, I vowed I would never be \"one of those flamboyant gays\" even though I was still low-key feminine / \"gay looking\" and just not very self-aware lol.\n\n-As I've become more comfortable with my sexuality &amp; made new friends (mostly girls or other gay men) I've felt less restricted in my behavior and tend to act authentically in stereotypically \"gay\" ways (though I think feminine might be a better word but idek what that even means anymore?) around these friends which I would never have DREAMED of doing as a teenager.\n\n-I dress very \"trade\" in public, I have a shaved head &amp; facial hair, tend to attract submissive girls &amp; gay boys looking for the whole daddy dom thing but my personality / sexual preferences are the exact opposite. Looking back I think I consciously started to dress / act more \"straight\" because of \"masc for masc\" culture in the gay world but now it feels like an act I'm putting on to blend in.\n\n-I did an impromptu drag performance (well, moreso gender-bending than full on drag) at a friend's show recently, really got in the zone, was dancing / behaving in ways I never do in public, felt amazing, received so much praise, felt good about myself &amp; was incredibly uninhibited (never am).\n\nI'm feeling like I've repressed a lot of my feelings because I was always shamed for acting how I felt and am only just now coming to realize it. All this being said, I have a hard time thinking of full-on transitioning. I like how I look as a man, I like having facial hair, I think I look hot lol.

The main problem is that my parents are really religious while I'm not. I dressed up like my usual self when we went to church 2 years ago and this women came up to my mother and asked her who is that boy? She was talking about me of course. My mother was too ashamed she didn't even tell her I was her own daughter. Ever since that day and every time we attend church I always have to wear a long dress or something girly so OTHERS would know that i'm a girl. Plus I tend to hang out with guys a lot, they play a lot of video games, mobile games and my parents are constantly about me doing boy things. They forced me to quit all my favorite games and I feel so empty inside of me. If I was a boy they would have let me do that kind of stuff but since i'm a female it's not \"lady-like\" for me to play video games. On top of that my religion restricts women so much. men could marry multiple women(have more than one wife) and I feel like that's wrong in so many ways but it's completely fine in my religion. It's like women are treated as things towards men. In my religion, women have to stay at home and do all the cooking for the husband, take care of the children, do all the cleaning and I feel like that's not right either. As a female, I am asexual and I don't even want children yet I have to go through my monthly cycle which limits me because I can't do much during that week. Since I don't want to have kids I don't want to get married either.

The reason why I am bringing this up here is because one of the characters of my story is a trans woman. In this story, the reader and the majority of the other characters are not immediately aware the character is trans. However, about half way through the story the main character will profess his feelings for her and this will cause her to feel obligated to reveal to him that she is trans. This is a rather important scene for my story so even though I am nowhere close to writing this specific part I want to start planning out some of the details because I want it to have a strong emotional impact while also maintaining a level of realism. As a cis male though I have no real life experience to draw upon for this scene so I was hoping to get some advice from everyone.\n\nThe general scene set up as I have it potentially planned out now is that up to this point it has been implied that she has had a secret that she has kept from all the other characters except her best friend. The main characters confesses his feelings for her only for her to quickly turn him down. It quickly becomes apparent that she feels the same about him and she only turned him down out of fear of how he would react to the truth. After a push from her best friend she reveals to the main character, and the reader, that she is trans. The main character is admittedly surprised by this but does make it clear that it does not affect how he feels for her, and the two officially start going out from this point on in the story.\n\nThe main things I want advice for is her reluctance to tell the truth and his reaction to said truth. Like I said, this is a very important scene to me and if a single thing is off I feel like the whole thing can fall flat. So, what advice would you give me?

So ever since I was a kid, my parents thought\nI was gay because I\u2019d play with both \u201cgirl\u201d and \u201cboy\u201d toys. So they tried getting me into more masculine stuff. I was never able to truly do it because I just didn\u2019t enjoy it. I always was interested in stuff that could be seen as feminine, but also masculine stuff I guess. When I got older into my teenage years I always liked playing as female characters in games, but didn\u2019t when I played with friends because I didn\u2019t want them to make fun of me, I still can\u2019t because I\u2019m afraid of repercussions, and I found out I was buy during my teenage years. Now I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m depressed and don\u2019t see a point in life.  I told my friend that I wish that I was born a female at times, by always followed it with maybe in another life. She replied saying that it sounds like I was going through dysphoria and I just said that couldn\u2019t be right that I was pretty comfortable with my body, etc etc. well I had the same thoughts again, and I started researching like signs and symptoms of it, and it said that some of the stuff I\u2019ve been through would be signs of dysphoria. Is there a way I can find out if I actually am or am I just confused on something? I\u2019m scared to find out because if it\u2019s true and if I were to transition, I would lose a large portion of my friends and almost all of my family except my mother because she\u2019s the only who\u2019s accepted me being bi. Is there a way for me to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me. Thanks in advance.

I've felt this way for months now and I educated myself about what gender dysphoria is like and thought it could be possible that I feel dysphoria to some degree but I'm scared that I'm only lacking self-esteem in my appearance. \n\nTo add more detail about what I'm feeling I should start about a couple years ago. I was going to a Catholic High School when I decided to grow my hair out because I thought it would be nice to do and because I wanted some individuality when going to a school where most guys looked the same. Over time it brought me comfort because since I had to take care of my hair it added some self-care to my daily routine which was lacking in that department.\n\nJumping to last year I had to leave that school and go into a home school program as my grandpa was diagnosed with Stage 3 Esophageal cancer and needed someone to stay at home with him at all times. My mother was busy with work and my grandmother wasn't exactly capable of helping so the responsibility fell to me. In this time I felt comfortable as I was lacking all the pressures of conventional high school life and started to pick up new skills like drawing and cooking so in a way I began to discover some amount of independence. I still hadn't cut my hair until freshman year of high school so it had grown to my shoulders which led to more and more random interactions with people calling me \"Lady\" or \"Girl.\" I never have been one to snap at people so usually they would apologize when they heard my voice or saw my face and I would say that it was alright and that it happened frequently. \n\nJumping to about a couple months ago now, I looked in the mirror and felt odd about my appearance. I looked at my more feminine features and was happy because it made me feel cute which was something I had never seen in myself before. Additionally, when the interactions when individuals called me female occurred I liked being called \"Girl\" or \"Lady\" or \"Miss.\" At the same time, when looking at what features I felt made me look ugly it was my more masculine features. It was at this point I tried to understand more about gender dysphoria and thought that I should wait it out and see if this is something that would blow over before pursuing seriously. At this point I just want to know if this is normal or if I am over-complicating a lack of self-esteem. Also I think it is important to mention that I have a therapist who I see every two weeks who I haven't discussed this with yet. I see her next on the 15th of May and she is the only person that I trust to speak with face-to-face about this. My mother is accepting of the lgbt+ community but from the way she talks she could never see me as a part of that community so I wouldn't want to talk to her until I figure out what I am feeling. So my major question is, am I feeling dysphoria or am I just lacking self-esteem? And if I am experiencing gender dysphoria what should be my first steps? \n\n(Also I'm sorry about the length of this! This was just something that has been on my mind for months at this point and it has been something I have debated with myself on. I felt this was a good place to post this as I want a completely outside perspective before I spoke with my therapist who knows me more personally. And if I said anything tone-deaf or insensitive I'm so sorry!

That being said, I didn't dismiss what he did. I wrote him a letter saying that even though what he did was cruel, that I was still going to support him in his transition if that's the path he chose to take.\n\nHe was wearing it today, along with a shirt we bought from the men's section. He looked so comfortable and bright. I think that's when I knew I'd made the right decision. \n\nAnd with that, my trans boyfriend binder saga comes to a close. Thanks so much to everyone in this sub who helped me and gave me advice. Even if things didn't work out between me and him, he still doesn't deserve to deal with the living nightmare that is dysphoria.

A little while after that I threw out all of the feminine clothes I held onto but never wore and I bought my first sports bra in years and then another and another until it was all I had.

In november the thoughts came back... but i began wishing i could be both genders bc in my mind, life was too short to just be one. after days went by... i began feeling uncomfortable being a girl... this went on for a bit and i would spend my days trying to figure myself out ... it went away for a bit but then in february it kinda came back... but this time, only the feelings of being uncomfortable as a girl were present. i didn\u2019t really have a desire to be a guy anymore. it\u2019s hard to explain but when i remember that i JUST have a female body, i feel fine.

Two weeks ago after another dream about looking and presenting as a girl and some dysphoria again, realized I still don't feel right about myself.\n\nI've been thinking and reading a lot in last 2-3 weeks, I realized how much I lied to myself and that being male feels more like smth I can cope with rather then a way in which I can be truly happy and confident. My therapist agrees I have a gender problem and I also managed to relax a bit in feeling female (a bit hard to explain) and at those times I felt soo much better.\n\nThe thing is, I still feel like I oscillate. I understand it's all kinda me, it's just that I am not only used to but also worked hard to accept and feel good about myself while I thought I was male and I am kinda proud how far I got. I learned to stop trying to fit in (by being more masculine), I unlearned some things I was still thaught as a male (mostly problematic), and I felt like I finally respected myself and that others respect me too for some things I really am. So it's not that I hate it nor I feeel like rejecting my whole masculine side.\nBut then again a big part of my confidence, my emotions and who I really am felt so buried in my mind before I started accepting I might be trans. I thought I would need so many years to get to it and now a simple answer to everything pops up: \"You are a girl!\". But I get so emotional and excited that it's hard to stick to it for longer and I end up back in my regular self, not feeling much. Or I keep analyzing my thoughts and behaviour, afraid I am doing smth wrong or just imagining the whole thing bc of oscillations.\u0107. Like I will go back to \"normal\". But I'd rather not, it might be easier but at some point it gets to being unmotivated and like I might just choose suicide instead of coffe.\n\nI am simply not sure what to expect, how 'should' I feel, what to do? The change itself also feels somehow strange now (I am 22y old). And that I might finally express what has been in my head like very personal stuff. I will get some clothes and makeup soon and hang out with friends as a girl but I am afraid how will I 'jump into' that, what if I just slip into feeling nothing?\n\nI know it's different for everyone, but did anyone go through something similar?

Not sure if I would call this venting? Perhaps sharing my story, or maybe just letting my emotions get the better of me.\nI am 26, Male-to-Female. Several years into transition, Though I learned a couple years in that I\u2019m also inter-sexed which adds complication I suppose. I\u2019m afraid this is likely going to be a long read.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nMother\u2019s Day is rather hard on me, Struggling with my emotions. It brings up feelings of being hopeless, Worthless, incomplete. The idea of being broken beyond repair, questioning if it\u2019s all even worth it. I never have a harder time fighting self harm than on mother\u2019s day. My life didn\u2019t decide it was enough for me to be Trans, Or to be inter-sexed. It found it proper to keep dumping things on me. Once upon a time I somewhat came to terms with my limitations, Accepted that someday I would look forward to adopting. Deep down it hurt more than I could put into words but I fought to move forward even if being infertile as a girl seemed like enough in my mind to justify dying. I have kept fighting, through severe abuse and struggle.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n I\u2019ve always had hypothyroidism, My endo always told me it was why even with estrogen I never saw much of a change with hrt, never got much breast development. More or less stayed the same really, I guess part of that I can credit to being inter-sexed, I\u2019m thankful that I\u2019ve always pretty much passed so that is nice. But my life didn\u2019t see that as enough, A couple years ago I started having more severe health problems. I developed severe migraines, Like Really really bad. A particular variety of migraine referred to as \u201chemipelegic migraines\u201d, Put simply it\u2019s like your brain short circuiting. In addition to the usual pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound you can expect from a migraine I also get stroke like symptoms, Slurred speech, Confusion, Numbness and paralysis in my right side. Significant near blindness in my right eye. Being that I\u2019m not uneducated in potential complications of hrt,,Like strokes I panicked the first time it happened, Cue the first trip to the ER for me. A CT scan, IV fluids and $2000 later..The diagnosis \u201cmigraines\u201d and I was sent home with a prescription for the pain. A week later I collapsed at work with another one. This time someone called an ambulance for me. I wasn\u2019t given the option to say no, so more bills and off to the ER with me once again. Same diagnosis, Except this time the dreadful news of stopping all HRT. I was horrified, crushed. But even after a few weeks of being hormone free I was still having these migraines. I eventually lost my job, Only to be sent of for another CT scan, And an MRI..Both of which came back clean. There was nothing \u201cWrong\u201d with me, Just these awful experiences. They are miserable and frequent. They have kept me from working, or getting anything done. I ran out of money long before getting any sort of diagnosis as to why I have them and the neurologist I spoke to, by his tone didn\u2019t believe I was having them. The good news is I now have a very supportive boyfriend whom I am grateful for. I have as much support as I could ask for. But deep down it makes this day hurt more.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until two years ago that it actually struck me, Mother\u2019s day 2016. I had gotten over the fact I would never bare a child only now to realize that I will likely never get the opportunity to adopt either.\nIt\u2019s been paralyzing dread, I should be on disability. I should apply for it, I should seek it out. But I don\u2019t even know if I could qualify, I don\u2019t have a diagnosis and I can\u2019t even prove I have these dreadful things. As I am I will never be financially stable enough to support a child even if I could adopt...But if I were to seek out disability, I doubt I\u2019d ever be able to adopt. Or even worse, If I have a diagnosis. Should my dream come true, medical science finally being progressive. that someday the option for me to bare a child presents it self, A diagnosis like \u201cchronic hemiplegic migraine disorder\u201d would disqualify me from ever experiencing the thing I want more than anything else. I struggle with every day but seem to make forward motion. I\u2019m back on hormones which is it\u2019s own small gift. And I\u2019m now struggling to make ends meet as an artist working from home. But it\u2019s barely enough to feed me, and I still suffer with multiple migraines a week. On normal days I get by, But On Mother\u2019s Day...I realize that the thing I dreamed of since I was little, Will never come true. No matter how loving I am, How much I think I deserve it. I\u2019m not fit to be a mother, No matter how much I tell my self it\u2019s not my fault. The world has decided it will never happen. I will never have children of my own even if it warms my dreams every single night. I will never be stable enough to offer a safe home to any child through adoption. I feel this crushing chill that I will never be whole.\n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nMother\u2019s day more than any other day, makes me want to die. It drags up urges of self harm.drives me to want to be in pain. It makes me feel like I deserve to suffer. Somehow deep down my mind starts to dig at me, to pry at my will. It makes me feel that I deserve this, That perhaps in some past life I did something so unspeakably horrible, that life would forbid me from the one thing my mind tells me I truly want more than all else. My logical mind tells me it\u2019s just another day, That it changes nothing. It makes it worse by making me feel absurd\u2026 I feel disappointed in my self for being upset. I hate my self for being so hurt. I\u2019ve survived this day twice over and I will do it again. My mind tells me I have to, I have to wake up tomorrow.

Hi! I'm Alexandria, and I'm trans AMAB, and prefer she/her/hers pronouns, thank you very much. I'm 17 years old, 6 ft 2.5 in, have ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD, and started my journey of questioning my gender since January 2016. \n\n\nMy earliest memory of any kind of \"confusion\" was when I was around 7 (2007, I guess the great thing about being born in 2000 is that the year is always my age). I had been playing around with makeup, and I had nail polish and lipstick on, and I remember feeling girly, and I remember liking it. My mom was going to Lifetime Fitness and she decided to take me with her, not knowing that I was all bedazzled up. When we arrived there, she looked back to the backseat, and I distinctly remember the look on her face when she saw me. Disapproval and scolding. She told me that I cant be going out looking like that and that boys aren't supposed to use makeup. I remember wanting to cry so badly, not understanding what was ever wrong with wanting to look girly. She made me take it all off before we went inside, and as the scent of acetone filled my nose, I started to cry. Not from the scent, but from what it meant, I guess. After that, there were other less significant ones like wanting to dress up with my step sisters but my dad saying no, wanting to do stereo-typically feminine things, and sometimes dressing up in my moms clothes when she wasn't home, and how good and cathartic it made me feel.\n\n\nThis all continued until middle school, where everyone started calling everything \"gay\" and didn't want to be negatively associated with all of that. I didn't have many friends and I was very self conscious about the way I looked, given I started puberty when I turned 12. Pimples everywhere. Hella voice drop. For reference, if anyone knows music stuff, my voice can hit an A1. Believe your eyes. A1. My normal talking voice now is around 90hz (something like an F#2), which is extremely dysphoric for me now, and has always been a source of anxiety for me, as I don't exactly like it. That summer I grew from 5 foot 5 in to 5 foot 11 in. I was the TALLEST 7th grader. I have stretch marks all over my butt, back, thighs, and knees. I can post pics of these if enough people request it. It looks like I got attacked by an animal XD.\n\n\nI cut for the first time on December 22nd, 2015. My mom took me straight to the hospital. She was so upset with me, I remember. Everything was just getting to be too much. My mom has really high expectations of me. She got a 36 on her ACT (perfect score) and a 1500 something on her SAT (almost perfect) and had a 4.0 GPA throughout highschool and college. Her IQ is 146. I was starting to fall behind in school, and she reacted to this by taking away anything that made me feel happy. My phone, my DS lite, my free time with friends (including my girlfriend at the time), books, etc. She would then hover over me while i sit at the kitchen table trying to focus but to no avail, as medication can only do so much for my ADHD. I came out to her sometime around February 2016, and I came out as transgender. I remember her saying things like \"You dont need to be focusing on these things right now\" and \"You have plenty of time to figure this stuff out later, right now your priority needs to be school work\" and \"being.... that.... would make your life so much harder than it already is. You think you have it hard now, but you just wait and see\" and even going as far as to interrogate me (in the metaphorical sense) about why\u00a0I think I'm trans. I didn't know how to answer. How does anyone answer that question? All I knew was that I was a girl, and I was being questioned on it. Right back into the closet I went. Anyhow, my\u00a0realization that I was trans came in January 2016, after my girlfriend at the time said that she was pansexual. At this point, I felt comfortable enough to tell her that I used to dress up all the time (and still did occasionally), and she was very excited and supportive of this. She said that I might be trans, and I thought it sounded off but might be. She started using she/her/hers pronouns and I remember how right it felt. We went to her place after school one day and we dressed me up in her clothes and it made me so happy to share this with someone else. Another day (May 31st, 2016) we went onto her parents boat (who were very accepting of everything) and I went wearing trunks and a bikini. The feeling was amazing. People were around but nobody gave me looks (i guess i must have passed :), and I had no idea how good an article of clothing could ever make me feel. It wasn't long after, though, that she broke up with me. It was June 10th, and I had been accepted into an early college program just the night before. This was one of the first real anxiety attacks that I had because it would mean that I wouldn't get to see her anymore. We had both been suffering a lot from depression, and for her, anxiety too. Anyways, on the 10th (3 days before my birthday, mind you) she breaks up with me. She said I wasn't good for her mental health (which was true) and that it wasn't a healthy relationship (it really wasn't healthy). I had never loved someone as much as I loved her, trusted someone as much as her, and that moment is when my downward spiral started. I came home and my mom wouldn't be there for me. She told me (notice the reoccurring theme here) that there were \"more important things to be thinking about and putting my energy into\". I spilled my fucking heart out to her and cried alone in the fetal position in my bedroom with a pillow covering my ears as she\u00a0screamed at me from outside of my door about how I'm an emotional mess and how I just need to suck it up and stop crying. I cut so deep that night that its still my biggest scar I have. My birthday came and went. Another day. No friends. Just me, alone, emotionally wrecked, and nothing but my own broad shoulders (which also made me dysphoric) to cry on.\u00a0\n\nThat summer came and went. I found out that she had cheated on me with a cis girl, and it killed me. I trusted her so much. Its been the main focus of every anxiety attack I've had since. Not being good enough (only exacerbated by my moms high expectations), constant fear of being cheated on, left. I was depressed the whole summer, and had been depressed until just about 1 month ago. Everything felt so fake. I cut every single night; it was the only way I could block out everything else. I became addicted to it, and after a while it became part of my every day routine. But even as a new hope loomed in the distance (going to my new school), I feared it was only a curse in disguise. I was so anxious about meeting all new people and having to make all new friends and it all just seemed so overwhelming. It was right around then that I got my license and a car, and a job at Target to pay for it all (more on this later!).\u00a0\n\nFirst day. I decided to shed my old name (AJ, short for Alexander John) and go by Alex because it was more gender neutral. Over the summer, I was so fixated and obsessed with my old relationship that when i thought about all my gender issues, it all just seemed... I don't know. Blurred? I identified as gender fluid from September 2016 up until just about 2 months ago. I guess I knew deep down that I was a girl, but I really wanted to figure things out with my emotions and stuff and it was a lot easier to just be gender fluid. Something that I wasn't. Truth is, it wasn't easier. I was miserable. Again, still with the verbal abuse from my mom. Constant disappointment, taking away things that make me happy, etc.\n\nBut then a new ray of hope. A new girlfriend. She helped me stop cutting and is always there for me, even if she doesn't understand what I'm going through or why I'm feeling the way i am at a specific moment in time. I'm still with her today!!! We became a couple on January 31st, 2017. I let her know that I was genderfluid, but that didn't seem to bother her, despite the fact that she thought she was straight. Anyhow, its about then that i grew a beard. Not just any beard. Ill post a pic. It was enormous. I looked about 11 years older than I actually was. For me it was more of an experiment. Just to see what i was comfortable with. Problem is, I got a lot of positive reinforcement from it, and while that made me feel good about the way I looked, it isn't about what other people think. Deep down I guess I knew I was girl and many nights i spent my time crying and pulling at my face because I couldn't stand the way it felt. The next year went by alot better, and by February of 2018, I went to see a therapist and she referred me to a psychiatrist who upon hearing about all the things that I was going to told me that I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. I was prescribed Lexapro, and we switched my ADHD medication, and ever since then, everything has been so much better and clearer. I came out to my girlfriend as trans, and she took it well, considering she didnt think she was straight. Apparently she's Panromantic and Heteroflexible (shes into boobs and femininity, but not the female version of the down there areas, which is totally fine because I like how things are down there too), and my coming out to her has opened her up to all of that. In the last 2 weeks, I came out to all of my school proximity associates and my teachers, my therapist, my one trans male friend, and Target. Target was just today. I told the HR rep, and he's going to tell most everybody for me. It feels really good to have such an amazing support team :).\n\nBut then there's my mom. I bet you can guess what she said when she came out to me if you very graciously took the time to read my life story XD. \"There are more important things to be focusing on right now\". Things are a little better, and she avoids pronouns, but still refuses to call me Alex. She's kinda a TERF.....\n\nI forgot to mention my dad. We've always had a really shaky relationship. My parents have been divorced since i was like 3 years old so i dont remember muvh with that... but he always seemed too busy to make it to the important things in my life. Anyways, flash forward to now, me trying to fix things with him. I have two brothers (one step, one half) that dont know Im trans and recently the problem has been that my dad is a business conservative, and he in no way supports or recognizes anything LGBTQ(etc). My stepmom on the other hand is more moderate and definitely more accepting. I want to be able to see my brothers (they're 10 and 3, and live in Canada while im in the US, btw) but i dont want my transition to negatively affect their lives. Divorce wasnt hard for me to get through, but it definitely wasnt easy. I feel that they might get divorced over it because my dad is the kind of person that would ignore my existence. I shouldn't put others before my mental health and my own well being but i care about my brothers so much and its really hard not to tell them something so important to me... if i even should tell them at all. And like i know that nothing would be my fault if anything did happen, but i feel like i would feel really bad knowing i coukd have just pretended to be something im not so that my little brothers can live happy lives.\n\nAnyways! That's where I am right now, doing voice training every single day and trying to avoid my mother at all costs. Thank you so much for reading if you did take the time to read all of that!! If you have any questions, Id be more than happy to answer! Have a wonderful days, ladies and gents and non binaries and aliens!\n\nSending love and support your way,\n\n-Alexandria Noelle\n\n", "date": "2018-05-14 02:49:32", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8j9307/my_story/", "author": "Alexandria_Noelle"}, {"title": "Started HRT at Planned Parenthood last week, here's how it went.", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-14 02:54:06", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8j93y6/started_hrt_at_planned_parenthood_last_week_heres/", "author": "neverforgetyourtowel"}, {"title": "Does NJ Transit still run trains to Atlantic City from Jersey?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-05-14 03:49:18", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8j9exl/does_nj_transit_still_run_trains_to_atlantic_city/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Welp", "text": "I have a friend that follows me online but I talk about being trans but he's kind of transphobic, I don't hate him or anything, I just felt uncomfortable and so I blocked him so he wouldn't see my posts and now I think he realized I blocked him and isn't happy and Im just ahhh idofjsifd ", "date": "2018-05-14 04:23:07", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8j9lke/welp/", "author": "cielbun"}, {"title": "Think my dads getting fed up-", "text": "So I talk to my dad a lot abt going on T (I\u2019m pre everything, FTM) an I talk to him Abt surgery idk if he understands it all I\u2019ve showed him a couple of video of people getting surgery an he was shocked.

Nobody is the arbiter of another persons identity. I\u2019m making this thread to discuss and expand my own (and hopefully other\u2019s) perspective, so let\u2019s keep the conversation respectful.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nLike I said in my disclaimer, I need some help sorting this matter out in my mind. For a while now, I\u2019ve felt some frustration with trans women and crossdressers/sissies being lumped together in the minds of cis people. For this post, I\u2019m largely going to be focusing on trans women rather than trans men and non-binary people, because a) my experience is that of a tran\u2019s woman, and b) because \u201c\u201dwomen\u2019s things\u201d\u201d are almost always relegated to the women\u2019s domain, whereas \u201c\u201dmen\u2019s things\u201d\u201d are more acceptable for everyone. I could explain this further, but that\u2019s a whole other topic. Though I just want to recognize that their are AFAB crossdressers, and I invite everyone to share in discussion.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor as long as certain groups have been repressed, oppressors have used scare tactics to maintain their power. In the case of trans folk, cis people often make baseless and inflammatory accusations that trans people are perverts and predators, trying to invade spaces they don\u2019t belong in order to take advantage of others. It\u2019s offensive and infuriating to know that, with enough repetition, some people begin to believe these lies whether consciously or unconsciously.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor this reason, I\u2019m particularly sensitive to having crossdressers and sissy fetishists grouped in with trans women, or even under the trans* umbrella as a whole. I admit some naivet\u00e9 to the exact nature of crossdressers/sissies interests, but my understanding is that a big reason both are done is for sexual purposes\u2014as kinks. Of course there are other reasons for crossdressing, like performance (as with drag) or preference of self expression deviating from gender norms, but by and large most accounts I\u2019ve heard from crossdressers is about sexual thrill.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any issue with crossdressing/sissy fetishism at all, for any reason; I think people should feel free to explore sexuality and kinks in safe and consensual ways. There is probably even some importance of trans people finding their gender identity through crossdressing and the like. My main discomfort is with CDs/sissies and trans people being grouped together by a cis/het/vanilla public at large, who often make no effort to differentiate one another when forming bigoted arguments against us.\n\n#TL;DR\u2014crossdressers \u2260 trans women, plz stop grouping us together cis people.\n\nSo my questions are:\n\n-Has anyone else felt this frustration?\n\n-Am I being ridiculous?\n\n-Should I be more accepting of CDs under the trans* umbrella?\n\n-How can I resolve my frustration?", "date": "2018-05-14 19:11:03", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8jeye4/misconceptions_about_trans_folk_and_crossdressers/", "author": "actual_border_collie"}, {"title": "Here\u2019s a great Foundation helping transgender kids.

I wish you the best. But I'm talking to people who are in a place where therapy and HRT is available, but due to anxiety or other factors are considering a DIY method. \n\nI'm not going to discuss if I think DIY methods are effective or not either. That's not really something I know a lot about and a lot more intelligent people have written about that subject. \n\nThat was all preface. Whew. That got wordy.\n\nThe other day I was looking at some of the sites I had bookmarked on an old PC relating to DIY hormones, before I decided to go the clinical route. I noticed many of the sites were gone, and of those that were not, many were not currently stocked. So I started poking around out of curiosity, and during that time a pretty big red flag went up. \n\nOne thing about any method, is that it needs to be consistent. If you miss days individually it isn't bad but if you go a week or a month without your supplement things stop working. Almost all of these sites are sketchy. The ones that seem legit come and go, and are often out of stock. Getting a consistant supply with DIY methods seems tricky. I'm sure some people have managed it, or found a hail mary website, but going the clinical route is so much better. They take blood and make sure the doses are right, they aren't giving you placebos or only half of what you need (T-blockers are just as, if not more important. I take 2 100mg t-blockers a day and 2mg of estrogen, for reference). My therapist is awesome, and so was my doctor. Picking up my script once a month is easy, and visiting a doctor every 3 months is something you should maybe do anyways if you have insurance? \n\nAnyway, I know there are reasons DIY can be the only option. But if you happen to be lucky enough to have a choice... I really recommend the clinical way of doing things.

Not physically(HRT is HRT), but legally. Like, would I be more likely to be denied surgery, since I didn\u2019t get evaluated by a therapist? \n\n2) Should I even try to get a therapist? Do they make the process of transitioning any easier legally(getting surgery, changing legal documents to reflect gender, etc.)? \n\n3) Could not going through a therapist effect how my insurance would or wouldn\u2019t cover any of my medical expenses? I know this relies on which insurance I have, but just generally speaking. Do most insurance companies care if you follow a path laid out by a therapist, or not?\n\nI\u2019m sorry if these are silly questions, I just don\u2019t really know where to start with some of this stuff, ya\u2019know?

Both of us had been drinking (but we were both still coherent) and since my tinder bio says that I am just looking for a cuddle, he came over... we cuddled... slept... I drove him to the mall this morning to catch his bus. We had made plans to hang out again today after his work. I texted him around 6 saying I wasn't sure if I'd still be able to meet up and didn't hear from him until about 1 this morning.\n\nHe wants to meet up again. He asks me questions like, \"did you like it when I gave it to you\" and \"I can still smell your pussy on my fingers\"... which was weird, but I assumed it was dirty talk. I have him the address again and said I'd need about a half hour to get ready.\n\nAfter getting all the way ready, I get messages on my phone. It's his wife. I immediately start shaking. I'm not trying to ruin anyone's shit, especially a marriage, and I'm also not passable. She says that she is outside and wants to talk \"woman to woman\" and that she \"won't hurt me\" but I am not comfortable going out and talking to her because she will know I'm a man.\n\nI told her that I'm completely uncomfortable with her showing up to my home (read, my friends home where I am just a guest) and I tried to answer her questions and say that nothing happened outside of cuddling and making out, that I wouldn't have done that if I had known he was with someone, and that I am sorry. Eventually, I blocked his account that she was but she knows my address and has my pics which I'm embarrassed about.\n\nI guess I just need to talk? I suffer from suicidal ideation and depression and have been doing really well... but this is making me so anxious. I don't want to be the other woman. Help, it's making me contemplate even being \"a woman\" because I knew I couldn't go outside and have a civil conversation \"woman to woman\" because she would know I'm a man.\n\nUgh. So anxious and scared right now. Just needed to share and maybe get some support and suggestions.\n\n", "date": "2018-05-26 08:07:49", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8m8qq7/need_some_help_with_this_anxiety/", "author": "GuadalupeMcGilicuddy"}, {"title": "Meme About My Gender Dysphoria", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-26 10:31:34", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8m9bqb/meme_about_my_gender_dysphoria/", "author": "alliamisbullets"}, {"title": "A Kid Like Jake | | QUEERGURU", "text": "", "date": "2018-05-26 13:31:00", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8ma5pj/a_kid_like_jake_queerguru/", "author": "rwdsobe1"}, {"title": "Binder recommendation?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-05-26 14:07:58", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8madbf/binder_recommendation/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Slipping gears going from nuteral to reverse.", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-05-26 15:38:44", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8maxnf/slipping_gears_going_from_nuteral_to_reverse/", "author": "action_jim"}, {"title": "please LMK NSFL [NSFW]", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-05-26 15:58:38", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8mb22v/please_lmk_nsfl_nsfw/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Feeling like a fraud", "text": "A little about me: I'm 30 and in the last year or two started to put together the puzzle pieces that lead me to the realization that I am, at the very least, not a cis male.

So I had months of thinking I was living as Jenny and getting uniformly misgendered, because I wasn't doing it right. I wasn't convincing. To me, this period of my life is what \"not passing\" really means. \n\nThen I learnt new ways of presenting myself. \\(I was taught. I'll be grateful until I die.\\) Misgendering more or less stopped. Correct gendering started. That's not to say it was as frequent as it would be for a cis woman. \n\nI had a bad period \\- I didn't know who I was. I wanted to feel female, my brain wouldn't let me. As a compromise, I identified as non\\-binary. I let my appearance slip. My voice pitch went down. My make\\-up skills, well let's not even go there. Right now, I still pass as non\\-binary, I believe. My voice is \"Contrapoints minus 1\", if there's a scale. My height is 6'1.\n\nThe other day, on the train, somebody leant over to me, passed me their phone, and murmured \"That's me!\" with a cheeky grin. The photo on their phone showed them presenting femme; on the train, they were presenting masc. We shared a wink. If I gave them some confidence, by being visibly trans, then it's worth all of this.\n\nBecacuse here's the thing: I'm attractive. My voice is androgynous. I have a female passport. People can see I'm biologically male, and in the UK, that often means people don't mean how to deal with me \\(because this is a cretinous country\\). But I present female, I look like a girl, I behave like a girl, I live like a girl, and since I started \"passing\" in this sense, and walking down the street looking like \"don't fuck with me\", I haven't had any confrontation, I haven't been called \"sir\".\n\nI'm proud of being trans. Unfortunately, in the UK, being visibly trans means that some people will misgender me, due to ignorance. I have to live with this. I have to be proud. I'm not a manky dude in a dress. I'm young, attractive, fresh, and I believe I make a difference every time I walk down the street.\n\nNot \"passing\", in this sense or that sense, doesn't mean you're gross, or a lost cause.

I didn't know how I'd find peace with myself in the next 20 days.

Manly in the sense that you need to be interested in football, you have to be confident and sociable, you should down pints at the pub and be good in fights, and I just dislike it all. I dislike the constant anxiety of making sure everything I do is manly. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells daily around even my own family. I'm at the point where I'm getting gray hairs from the stress of it all. To be honest, I don't know if that's just genes, but I'm going to assume not.\n\nThe best I can describe is that I'm in this constant state of suffocation which I can't really describe or explain.

I have zero problem with it - seeing them become happy and become themselves both physically and emotionally has been a joy and an honor to me.\n\nI have this other friend, who has a very, very strong track record of flip-flopping on things.  (Transferring schools all the time, moving from house to house, picking up and dropping friends, radically switching fields of study at the drop of a hat, flip flopping on sexual orientation, etc.)  They recently announced that they are nb, and decided to change their name.

However, a month and a half post-coming out, they decided to start T, despite telling me a week earlier that they themselves were skeptical / were thinking that it was not the right move.  I am having a really hard time supporting this decision - it was not discussed with a psychiatrist, and came so soon after realizing their own identity, PLUS they seemed to think it was not wise just a week or two ago.

Internally, I am skeptical.  Am I in the wrong?  I think I am...  They know themselves better than I do, of course.  Would it be the wrong move to tell them I think they should slow down and just think it over?  Or talk to a doctor or support group first?  I just want them to be happy, and I want to learn how to be a supportive friend.

Asking for a little clarity and perhaps guidance. 33/masculine male/just out of a dead end relationship\n\nAt 24 I met a girl just in a regular bar, extremely attractive, petite, well spoken etc. We hit it off and on the third real date she disclosed she was mtf...I had no idea what that meant, and not even the slightest clue that she was. I asked questions she explained, told her I was still onboard and really had no idea until she said so. In our time together she met friends, family, and no one suspected or questioned otherwise. Didn't have to adjust or hide anything other than her turning down swim/beach invites with my friends.\n\nWe went back and forth on what I guess you would call the dominant role in the bedroom, if you know what I mean. She wasn't shy with it either and expected anything she did to me I would do to her, and although hesitant at first something about being dominated in that fashion by a beautiful girl was extremely erotic, as well as the obvious what I know now is p-spot stimulation. But I enjoyed being the dominant one just as much.\n\nWe were together for about 8 months and then one day she broke the news that she had been going through alot personally and job wise and decided she wanted to move to a more \"tolerant\" area. Being in the conservative south - Louisiana, I understood but finishing school and a good job of my own I could not leave.\n\nI often think about her, the things we did. It was just a happenstance meeting that led to it and every relationship since has been typical male female. The experience stuck with me and over the years brought up strap on use with partners, not sure if it's the being dominated aspect, or if subconsciously trying to recreate. But lately I think about it more and more, I have tried to look on dating sites etc, but no such luck other than \"professionals\" that really aren't exactly what I'm looking for. I have accompanied a female friend to a local LGBT bar to scope out and not really anything in the realm of what I'm looking for.\n\nSo I guess to get to it, where in Louisiana, specifically Baton Rouge would one find a passable trans for a relationship? Maybe its the way the internet narrows the pool, but I have looked through the subs here and see so many attractive goddesses here but in real life its like finding a needle in a needle stack. Is the issue that I am desiring something so passable that I am just assuming they are when I see them, or is it what I really think, that in Baton Rouge/Louisiana there just aren't really any here.\n\nI did see a girl on POF and wanted to message so bad but there's a severe age difference as she is 20. Other than that I'm lost.

I'm afab and am unfortunately prone to bouts of depression and frequent psychosis. I wasn't really aware of other gender identities for most of my life, partially because I come from a pretty conservative family. For a long time, I've wanted to be a boy. No dysphoria or anything at the time, I just thought it'd fit me better and I liked the pockets.\n\nAround summer when I was 13, I was invited to cosplay with some friends at a convention. I chose a male character and, even though my friends said it wasn't necessary to act like the character, I did all sorts of research into how boys typically walk and act and talk so I could 'play the part right'. I practiced the walk and tried to lower my voice and all that, even though on some level I think I knew it wasn't for the cosplay. When the day finally came, someone I didn't know used he/him pronouns for me. I didn't get why, but it had an immediate impact on me. I almost started crying because of the sheer amount of emotion I felt, it was like something unlocked. Loosely, it felt like a punch you know you deserved. Painful, but right. At the time, I excused it as having a sudden, unrelated wave of emotion. Even though I thought it might have been a result of being called he, I excused it because it didn't make any sense. I had never even heard of the concept of being trans.\n\nThe same year, I got my first phone. One of the first things I did was record my voicemail, and I recorded it trying to sound lower. I just knew it was the impression I wanted to give off and didn't know why.\n\nWhen my childhood best friend came out as a trans man, it was the first time I'd ever heard of anybody not actually being the gender they were born as. I didn't fully get it, but I stood by him and did my best to support him. After a lot of research and mistakes, I've come to understand him a lot better. We're still inseparable four years later, and he's recently started HRT! As proud as I am of him for coming this far, I'll admit I've found myself slightly jealous. I'd never begrudge him his happiness of course, but I just wish I could find mine too. \n\nThe thing is, I've had other experiences besides these three which have made me question my gender, most recently extreme discomfort with my body that's lasted for months and won't go away. It's led to a major decline in my mental state and talking about it is causing friction with a really close friend (not the one mentioned above).\n\nIdk what to do at this point. If I do turn out to be trans, my ultra conservative family will freak out. If I'm not, how do I fix the discomfort? I don't even want to be a boy that badly, I just want this incongruous feeling to stop and I'm pretty sure being a boy would fix it even if I can't put my finger on why.\n\nThanks for listening.

I have honestly wanted to ask this question for awhile now, and I think I need to find a way to address this to help me be a better person as well as to silence something that is causing me a bit of anxiety.\n\nConfession: I am uncomfortable with non\\-medical transness. \n\nIt is the comparison that gets to me. I am a trans woman and my \"transness\" is firmly rooted in biology. I have a medical condition that makes me honestly unhealthy when I am testosterone dominant. As far as I am concerned, my \"transness\" is pretty under control because it is being treated, finally, with great results. There are plenty of further hurdles and this is a journey that never truly ends... however that line between \"unhealthy\" and \"healthy\" is clear, trans\\-specific and able to be treated by medication that has literally turned my life from being all upside down to suddenly just making sense.\n\nTo be very specific. I have to confess that I am made very, very uncomfortable (both socially and philosophically) with the idea of individuals who are AMAB trans women (specifically) but then do not make any kind of efforts to actually medically transition.\n\nThis isn't necessarily a straight\\-up transmedicalist position (though I consider myself one, because it is pretty impossible to deny the scientific basis at this point) and I certainly am aware that one of the common, shitty elements of our culture is a lack of access to proper medical care or that for some, the regimen of HRT isn't something the body can always easily handle. Individuals who desire treatment but cannot for reasons (including the common self\\-inflicted kind of psychological wounds!) are completely understandable to me.\n\nBut, to be blunt, I simply do not understand how someone can be AMAB, claim a trans woman identity and then... intentionally remain full of testosterone. I'm sorry, but I don't care how someone identifies, but I do care about the severe effects of HRT and how different running on different hormones can be for a body. At this moment, I would be inherently uncomfortable allowing someone full of testosterone and with non intent to change that access to women's spaces. This goes double when I am full aware of how... terrible many trans persons can be while they suffer with the wrong hormones and social contexts and everything nasty we deal with.\n\nI sincerely want to move past this because I know this is lingering internalized transphobia and not something that actually matters at all. That said, contexts which reject or erase the bio\\-medical aspect of transness are very threatening to me because my transness is absolutely, 100&amp;#37; a shitty medical condition I never asked for nor desired. Now that I am receiving treatment, like most trans persons who go on HRT, I am without a doubt healthier. Help me understand how this works, because as things stand now I have been fairly unable to shock myself out of this mindset. I need to have a context to understand this different experience of transness because it inherently sits so polarized opposite to my own lived, researched and understood trans experience in ways I honestly struggle to accept due to my own limited (and strong) experience.\n\nUhg, thanks. This probably won't be fun, per se, but I really hope I can be prodded outside of myself to be able to better get away from my own deep experience that is super\\-tough to break away from. \n\nTL;DR: Affirming myself in some ways causes an inherent problem with affirming some other trans persons, and I don't find that acceptable and want to change what I recognize isn't a healthy place to stand.", "date": "2018-06-10 12:01:34", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8q0cq6/help_me_get_over_a_crummy_lack_of_knowledge/", "author": "KittiesStarsnGlitter"}, {"title": "Advice on fundraising surgery", "text": "Hey everyone.

I can now say I've officially introduced myself as a woman! So, how did I get here? Well, if I told you my full story it would take way too long, so let's just limit it to my gender self discovery, okay?\n\nIn the summer of '89 in Atlanta, I was born. My genitalia is an outie so they put an M down on my birth certificate, gave me a guy name, and treated me like a boy. My whole life I've been expected to fulfill this mythical calling of a man. I always felt so disconnected from that role though I never had a way to place my finger on it, didn't have the words yet to say that I didn't feel like other boys and liked being around girls better.\n\nWell, in a moment that now was totally like a second birth but at the moment should have been the death of me (actually, it was, a start of a slow death of the boy me and the birth of the girl me) I had to wear my sister's underwear one day. I actually discovered that they were nice. I wanted her underwear, though I couldn't tell anyone, boys don't want girl underwear.\n\nIt was middle school that girl me started to come out a little more. I would experiment with my sister's clothes and spend what felt like hours in front of the mirror looking like a weird boy. What boy would stuff a bra? What boy would know to hide his penis in a pair of panties? What boy would even want to look that much like a girl? Well, it turns out that boy wasn't a boy after all. She just didn't know.\n\nWhen I finally got access to the internet in the house in high school, I discovered this whole world of people born like me. I still fought it for several years later. I have slowly \"adapted\" into the ways of being a man but it feels so much like an act and is finally coming to a head. I am not a man, this role is not for me. I can't fathom growing old as a man, a husband, any of the male titles.\n\nWhen I am with friends, I feel so disconnected. When I am, in rare moments, able to feel comfortable enough to express myself closer to my true identity, I feel so much more...alive. It's like all the parts of me that are forced to stay hidden are able to just flow out. When I am able to think of myself as a woman, I feel like I can visualize, to an extent, being with someone as their SO, having a home that we share, hanging with the girls on the weekend, that type of stuff.\n\nOverall, being a man kills me, being a woman brings me to life. Being a man feels like a chore despite being easy. Being a woman, despite being hard, feels so much more of what I want. I can't see forcing my body into a more masculine path.

For the past 6 years or so, I've been mostly out as a gay woman. I dress moderately androgynous, but certainly don't present as a male or even very masculine. I have short hair, but often wear makeup and love painting my nails.\n\nI think I can remember having thoughts as a kid about wishing I was a boy, but they are distant and fuzzy memories so I'm not really sure. As I got older, I stopped thinking about it. I lived my life as a girl and didn't think much of it. I was never particularly feminine but I was also not uncomfortable in my body. I also relate to other women far easier than I relate to men.\n\nBut lately, I've found myself having this attraction to men, and it's not really a sexual or romantic attraction. Sometimes it feels like it is, but it's different. It's hard to describe, but it's more of a fascination with some guys or specific characteristics that some guys have. I'm starting to think it's that I want to be that or have those characteristics.\n\nThen, my doctor prescribed me a low dose of testosterone. This wasn't gender-related, but it was because my body was not producing any on it's own and it turns out you need it for important bodily functions. When it was prescribed, he said it wasn't nearly high enough of a dose to lead to any significant changes, but he warned me that it might lower my voice a little, thicken my body hair, and make my bone structure a little more prominent. My more feminine friends would have been terrified, but I felt a weird sense of hope for those things. I liked the idea. I almost wanted to take more than the prescribed amount to see if I could heighten the effects.\n\nThat's when I really started questioning this. I started to play around with the idea of choosing a male name for myself, and it makes me feel good and bad at the same time. I haven't changed anything about my physical appearance, though I want to try. I'm just uncomfortable with the way other people will perceive it, and if it will give away the fact that I am struggling with this.\n\nI haven't voiced these thoughts to anyone. My best friend is a trans man and I haven't even told him. Sometimes I wonder if it's just me being influenced by the fact that I hang out with so many trans people, but something tells me that's not it. I think this is something that was there before I met any of them. I just wasn't willing to acknowledge it. And maybe they are all my friends because I'm drawn to something about it.\n\nThis terrifies the hell out of me. Partially because I just don't know, and I always thought this was just something people knew. The friends I talk to all talk about how they felt like their gender their entire lives, and being misgendered made them absolutely miserable. I don't have that experience. Sometimes I try to picture myself as a male, and I just can't see it. But other times I feel so drawn to the idea. I just wish that I could magically be a male for a few days, try it out, and see if it fits or not. But binding and putting on male clothes and trying to \"present\" as male just feels like I'm acting and putting on a persona. It doesn't feel like me. Yet, being me doesn't always feel like me, either, if that makes any sense.\n\nAlso, as transphobic as it sounds, I am afraid that if I did want to transition and become male, it would never be enough. I wouldn't be able to fully become a \"man.\" And I'm not sure that I want to be something in between.\n\nAnd finally, I can't imagine turning my whole identity upside down. Asking people to change how they refer to me or how they see me. I grew up very Catholic in a very conservative place. I have a lot of conservative friends. I'm mostly out about being gay, but not even completely out about that to everyone because I'm afraid of the judgment. And this is a whole new level of scary.\n\nObviously some of this is jumping the gun. I'm not sure if I'm even trans, so talking about changing my name or coming out is presumptuous. But sometimes I wonder if the fact that I'm questioning it gives me my answer.\n\nI just don't know.", "date": "2018-06-16 00:10:16", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8rflgo/i_think_i_might_be_trans/", "author": "GrotiusandPufendorf"}, {"title": "My facial hair ruins my transitioning dream", "text": "I feel like I'd be very motivated to transition but my facial hair ruins it for me.

I just wanna get this off my chest, cus I think about it often.\n\nI was on tinder and I had matched with this Transwoman. I knew she was trans. I myself had been with a Transman on more than one occasion. We were talking and flirting. I'm not sure how long we've been talking. I just knew two things: She was close, we were both looking to fuck. I was working on editing a video and had told her that I was editing and it was super boring and etc. She still wanted to come over she told me that she \"didn't mind\" that she was cool just watching me work. I was like..Ight..fuck it, slide through. I had shared an apartment with my sister, and she had a few friends over and they were chillin, I was working so I was in my room. The tinder girl comes over and I'm a pretty tall dude (6'4) so I was surprised that she was about 6' and it was clear she was early in her transition, didn't bother me and we made our way to my room. First thing she had asked me when we got to my room was if I had any bud. I don't remember if she had just gotten a new grinder or bowl or something but she wasn't looking to buy (not that I was a dealer anyhow). I had just rolled a blunt and took a few hits because I can't work effectively while high and passed the blunt to her, and I just let her millie rock. \n I'm editing and I can hear her through my headphones smoking this blunt. I shit you not. That sound effect when Kirby is doing the suction move is how this girl sounded smoking this blunt. Blunt Dead. About 10-15 minutes go by, she gets up and leaves my room. The bathroom is right next to my room and the door was open so it wasn't hard to miss going in and I kinda just put two and two together and just continued working on the video. When she gets back I half ass tried to keep a conversation, but since my eyes and ears were in use I can only imagine it was like talking to a wall. Another 10-15 minutes go by and I'm noticing she's been asking for weed a lot throughout our conversation. I told her that I'm most likely going to be working on this all night and I have to get up for work early which prompts her to leave. After she leaves, my sister comes to my room and tells me that at some point this girl had came up to her &amp; her friends also asking them for weed. I was livid. I had offered her nearly a whole blunt to herself when she had first came to my home. That night the tinder girl and texted me that I could have just turned her down and she would have left. I'm pretty sure I told her she was a shitty guest and just unmatched her. \n\nI'm pretty sure she took that as an offence towards her transition, that I as a cis-male (at the time) was anticipating a different experience and didn't find her attractive. I was just busy, but after I had found out that she was looking for weed from not only me but my sister and her guest, I felt used. I don't think I ever got the chance to express that it had nothing to do with her appearance and everything to do with her manners as a guest. I was upset, but I'd hate to think that I in anyway contributed to her dysphoria and made her feel invalidated.

I made this thread as a place to share the things we have done to better our minds and bodies. I want to learn about your experiences with yoga, meditation, spiritual teachings, as well as things like diet, supplements, and exercise. This is my first thread, and I'll appreciate all the feedback that I get!!\n\nI started transitioning MtF January 20th this year. My mood is constantly higher, my emotions flow more freely, and I love myself and who I am becoming. The best thing that I've done for myself is learning to love who I am.\n\n I started this journey by asking myself some questions, and meditating by letting go of my extraneous thoughts until an answer came back to me from my spirit (who I am, underneath my personality). If you know that you would be happier as a girl and can not (or will not) fully remove the desire to be a girl, that is the start of this journey. It is time to consider transitioning if you realize that your spirit is feminine and you wish for your body to become more feminine. If you let go of all reasons and desire for being masculine, you are fully ready to be transitioning. I came to that last realization, and there's still much more that I can learn; my motivation comes from that.\n\nFor myself, changes have started, and my endocrinologist told me that this is a marathon; not a race. Although I'm changing faster than I expected, I still have a lot of work I want to do: hair removal, yoga for flexibility and general well being, daily exercise to tone my body, and reading teachings of enlightenment to better my spiritual understanding. It will be about a year/ 1.5 years until I make the jump from guy to girl. I'm OK with waiting, because I am making progress  every day to get there; I am learning constantly, so I don't feel waiting and bored. I love myself today, because my body is an extension of my mind, and both are becoming better as I am constantly improving them. Faceapp showed me a good idea of how I will look when I make the change, and I love who I will become, too.\n\nThis is a serious decision I made to constantly change myself, but I don't regret it at all. The things that help me most are meditation, exercise, yoga (stretching is Super important to attain a nice body), healthy eating, and not masturbating (balanced hormone cycles are also key). I feel 10,000&amp;#37; better when I do these things every day. Outside of work, I read a lot, and it's through finding my own spirituality that I was able to actually let go of my depression and anxiety, and not just mask it. I find a lot of importance in the Buddhist teaching of the three jewels, and this is my understanding: Buddha (that we all may become enlightened: unhindered by out past, fully present, happy, and not bothered), Dharma (the truth, Dao, the way through life which is virtuous, enlightening, honest, and good), and Sangha (community founded on love, honesty, and mutual learning).\n\nI believe in every spiritual path, and in every religion. I read some really helpful books: Vitality Energy Spirit, The Secret of the Golden Flower, The Twelve Enlightenments for Healing Society, and I'm currently reading the Road Less Traveled. I recommend all of these, but everyone's path is unique. I read on r/trans for others' similar experiences, and I'm really grateful for this place. I believe that the most important spiritual teaching is that God is love, love is within everything, and love is the most powerful force. \n\nFor anyone who is considering transitioning: Tell your friends that this is who you are, and surround yourself with those who love you back. Forgive those who don't, and you can let them know that you need to take a break for them in order to live your authentic truth.\n\nLove yourself, and everyone else, because the world is you as much as you are the world.  :)\n\nThanks for reading!

No more fighting, we're on the same page with the kids, have been working great as a team and have actually become really good friends.  Recently I've entered therapy for anxiety and my absolute inability to trust anyone, at all.  No surprise I've been closeted my whole life, right?\n\nThings took a hard left a couple of weeks ago in therapy when that periodic wave of dysphoria crashed in again.  I wrote a post on /r/asktransgender, and literally just bawled my eyes out as I read all of the overwhelming support that poured in.  I came clean to my therapist the very next day, and she was just a wealth of support, knowledge, resources.  It was the most difficult and validating experience I can remember.\n\nOne issue that came to the front - the entirety of my marriage, right from the beginning, my ex knew I was hiding something.  I absolutely wouldn't come clean because I assumed she would leave me on the spot if I ever told her the truth.  Ironically, she left me because of the suspicion, my depression and anger, all because of the thing I was hiding.  I might've had a chance if I'd trusted the woman I swore to trust.  I guaranteed failure by hiding.\n\nFast forward to this weekend.  I came clean last night to her.  I sincerely apologised for lying to her throughout our relationship.  Despite the terror of her cutting me off from the kids (she's pretty conservative), I talked, and she listened.  And, once again, I totally underestimated her.  She thanked me, and not only that, she supported me 100%.  She wants to help, feels validated and that she can move forward, and is going to help me work forward and make a plan that involves our kiddos (9 and 5 boys) in a healthy way.\n\nI love that amazing woman.  Not as a wife anymore, but absolutely as family.  Remember, as hard as it is, there may be people close to you who deserve your trust. \u2764\ufe0f", "date": "2018-06-24 20:58:49", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8tkufd/i_came_out_to_my_ex_wife_and_coparent_this_weekend/", "author": "ijustwanttobejess"}, {"title": "Using the men\u2019s restroom as a trans guy...", "text": "I\u2019m pre-T so it was kinda risky being in there, but I felt like I was a cis guy.

I'm really bad at coherently expressing myself when it comes to emotionally charged topics, so I was lame and did it over a group text. I sent them this \n[CBSN Gender documentary](https://youtu.be/ZFWrzw9szt8) to watch and said that this is how I've been feeling about myself for a while and wanted them to watch it and they could call me to talk about it after they were done. \n\nMy folks are Evangelical Christians and home schooled myself and my younger brother in a rural area in the southern US, so needless to say I wasn't expecting it to go well. I had already told them about 8 years ago that I had lost my faith and was an atheist, and that was quite an ordeal that they're still coming to terms with. My brother is also a non believer now, and I came out to him as trans about 6 months ago (not too long after I figured it out for myself) and he's extremely supportive, so I knew I'd still have family if it went bad with the 'rents. \n\nSurprisingly, my dad is supportive, and says he loves me no matter what, even after I told him I'm taking testosterone. Yay! On the other hand, my mom is basically ignoring it, and has since talked to me about things completely unrelated to the bombshell I dropped the other day. I plan on calling her tomorrow to try to clear things up sooner rather than later, especially since my daughter is supposed to go spend two weeks with them at the beginning of July while my husband is recovering from surgery. \n\nI still have to come out to my in laws (all 4 of them) and all the grandparents before I feel like I can be out to the rest of my very large extended family and friends or on Facebook. But, I feel like I really want to get the ball rolling so I can begin living as me. I've already lived 1/3 of my life or more as a confused little egg who always felt more like a gay dude than a straight chick. I've gotta start making up for lost time! \n\nThanks for reading.

I\u2019m 17 years old and was born a girl. As a child my father touched me inappropriately and would physically abuse me. I barely remember it, but in 2015 I got flashbacks to it. In 2016 I started really noticing things about myself. I don\u2019t like my body. I know I\u2019m attractive. I don\u2019t like having a vagina. I don\u2019t like having boobs. I\u2019m pretty flat, but god, it sucks! As a kid I\u2019d wear boy clothes. I\u2019d also wear pink sparkly stuff because sparkly stuff is pretty dang cool. However, I stopped loving sparkly things and the color pink as puberty hit me. In 2016 around the same time I started questioning my gender I began to like glitter and pink again. This time I only like pale pink. I saw lots of boys wearing that color and I just wished I could pull it off like them. \n\nI wish I had a penis. I wish I had abs. I wish I had facial hair. I wish I was taller. I wish I was a man. Anytime I see a male celebrity or any man I feel attracted to them. It\u2019s an attraction that\u2019s like \u201cI want that\u201d and \u201clet me be you\u201d. I only like girls and have only ever been attracted to girls. I\u2019ve had the same girlfriend since 2015 and we\u2019re long distance. She knows about this and is very accepting and warm about it. She does everything she can to make me feel comfortable and so do my friends. \n\nI\u2019m too small for men\u2019s clothes, sadly. I want to wear them so bad but my grandma doesn\u2019t want me to do this. I feel like I\u2019m in a costume when I wear girl clothes. I would feel natural in men\u2019s clothes. Thinking about wearing a suit or an outfit designed for a male almost feels like a relief. \n\nAs a kid I assumed puberty wouldn\u2019t apply to me. I wouldn\u2019t get a period. Why would I? And when I was younger than that I thought I\u2019d just grow a penis. I loved cars. I still do. God, I love cars. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is messy or silly. I\u2019m just confused. I know only I can tell myself who I am. I just need some guidance. Did anyone else have a similar experience? Do you think I could be trans? My friends think so and so does my brother who is also trans. He\u2019s older than me and recently started T and I\u2019m so happy for him but also felt strangely jealous. \n\nAny advice is welcome.

As kava was the only thing I could assume was the culprit, I did further research, and discovered that it does indeed strengthen hair follicles, and turn invisible, vellus hair into COARSE, *very* visible hair. Yesterday, I had my first laser session in at least 5 years to get rid of it.

I also lived in a small city of about 20 000 people, which is probably a lot for some people, yet still very much a everyone-knows-everyone town. I didn't know any transgender people, I didn't really have any LGBT friends whatsoever, \u00a0yet I didn't feel alone, well, kinda, I didn't fully know who I was, so how could I feel like the only one of something I didn't know I was? I was alone, I'm just another bully victim, cast out over nonconformity and no social skills (which turned out to be autism, I was diagnosed like a month ago). It's only in the last couple of years I've faced it head one, alone.\n\nI have all the tools to be happy, a very understanding and supportive mother, great friends who don't care, and a girlfriend who would be there 100%, yet, here I am, needing the comfort and help of strangers, nearly everyone in my entourage knows I'm gender non conforming (my family doesn't) yet they all watch me do basically fuck all about it, other than have a woman's shirt, almost as if I'm pretending, yet the sadness I feel when I know I don't have breasts destroys me, why can't it be simple? The pain of knowing that no matter what, I'll feel like an imposter, it burns, in a cowardly way, I don't want to be trans, I just wanna be a simple girl, those words hurt me too, it's wrong to suggest that trans women aren't less of a woman than others, yet it's the only way I can write it, I want the simplicity, not the fight. You all inspire so fucking much, your portraits of a social war you're the war heroes,the example for us all, you're everything I dream of being, and more. why don't I get a move on to become myself? DOUBT. I look like a guy, I have hairy albeit damn nice legs, I have a somewhat deep voice, and many masculine traits. I feel like I can't become the woman I want to be, I'll never be undisguisable from biological woman, i just feel like I'll never be able to pull it off. maybe all of this is me just wanting reassurance, hoping you all know what I feel, maybe this can remind anyone that they're not alone.\n\nit's the choices we make, for me, it's two dreams of mine, music, and, children, first off, music, as said before I want to be a singer, so I'm scared off fucking up my voice, this isn't the main thing though, I'm okay with signing as a \"man\", it's not the depth of my voice that will define my writing and compositions. When it comes to my music, damn I'm proud to be gender non conforming, I have big ambitions, and man do I work for them, my so far are intertwined with who I am, otherwise what's the point? if I can be a someone millions of gender non conforming, trans, anyone on the spectrum can look up to, I'll try my hardest to do so, I wanna be a musician who is gender non conforming, non a gender non conforming musician, just like I'm just one of you, I want the world to see us a just one of them. secondly children, I've always wanted children, so that's why I'm not on HRT, I know I could adopt, but I'm fussy and want at least one biological kid like me, it's stupid, but it's my choice, so maybe I'm just giving up a dream for another.\n\nthis was all really just a rant, I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time, I hope it was a least enjoyable to read. I think I'm just looking for acceptance, maybe o should try to become more female, if anyone is interested I'd post me trying here, yet, maybe under a different account, one just for it, I'll keep you posted. thank you for reading, the world is in desperate need of love and compassion, and maybe a sprinkle of empathy, I hope at least someone will read this and this and think \"I'm not alone\"\nNo one knows who they are, it's okay to not know, you should always try your best (I definitely not following what I preach but fuck it)\nBe proud\nI never said exactly what I identify as, and that because I don't know and don't care about a label, gender is dead, but the future is female.\n\nYours.

Somehow over the last several years, I have lost a lot of confidence.  \n\nI have stopped going to the local transgender support group.  I give myself hours and hours to femme up for it (and I even have a girlfriend willing to do my make-up for me).  But when I get to the point where I've shaved my face and showered and it's time to get dressed, I either get unbearably nervous and/or I manifest these strong headaches.  I think the headaches are a defense mechanism, my inner critic subconsciously trying to protect me from rejection.  If I'm in too much pain to leave the house, no one can see and reject my girl self.  I hate going in boy mode and introducing myself with my female name.  I feel like a fraud, especially when most everyone else is dressed and looking good.  \n\nI would really like to be able to attend the trans events that are 90 minutes away.  Those ladies don't just have meetings.  They go out, dance, and have fun.  I got to hang with them after Pride one year.  But it's going to take a lot of baby steps to get to that point.  \n\nI put a lot of my female self on the back burner about six years ago to deal with family drama.  And then it kept going.  And my place in the family is to be quiet and supportive and not make waves (for instance, not wear nail polish to the family business, especially in boy mode).  I miss the girl who was brave enough to wear nail polish 24/7 (even if that doesn't feel like an option now).  I miss the girl who felt beautiful and didn't care so much how much \"more\" beautiful everyone else looked.  I miss the feminine joy of that side being more a part of my life.  As Bob Dylan said, \"I was so much older then.  I'm younger than that now.\" \n\nI feel like the laziest crossdresser/bi-gender girl.  It feels like i am too tired to dress after work half the time or I don't even think about it (ADD is a bitch) or I'm strict with myself about only dressing when I'm clean shaven (though some of the people on here are proving to me you can have facial hair and be cute as hell in girl clothes).  And my perfectionism and fear of failure have kept me from learning how to do my own make-up and caused me to forget what I used to know.  (Again, inner critic and subconscious.  If I had the freedom to go out en femme any time I wanted, I might get in \"trouble\" or get hurt or something.) \n\nI've made a commitment to give the Josie part of myself at least 30 minutes a day to do whatever she wants.

This is small potatoes to some of you who are brave enough to be transitioning/have transitioned, but to me it was a big deal. I've always been afraid of the judgment and how I'd be treated if I did so.\n\nAlso, for background, I am most probably trans but too much of a pussy to go through with any actual transitioning (mainly because I couldn't bear to come out to my family, who is not really cool with that kind of thing and would disown me). So I settle for dressing up and pretending, which I've always done in private, until last night.\n\nThe place I went was a drag show at a gay bar, so pretty much the most supportive possible environment for my first time doing this. Though of course I still had to walk to and from my car out in the \"regular\" world. One of my neighbors, who hangs out on his porch all the time, saw me and did look pretty surprised... I do wonder if he'll say anything to me next time he sees me.\n\nOverall, people paid far less attention to me than I feared. In fact, after I was starting to feel comfortable I kinda wanted more attention, because I thought I was looking pretty cute tbh! Of course, it was a gay bar, so not all that surprising.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that when interacting with others, women (who I don't know) were far more likely to physically touch me, like a light shoulder touch or whatever, which is something that basically never happens as a man. Everybody was really nice, I did get a lot of smiles, and even got called \"sweetie\" (which I liked, and also something that never happens as a man).\n\nHoly shit is it a bitch to stay in heels for hours though! I've worn them around the house of course, but never for that long continuously before. And they were wedge heels, not even crazy stilettos or anything. That part is really gonna take some getting used to.\n\nDefinitely feeling a lot more confident, and will be making more trips out while dressed.

I couldn\u2019t relate to every single detail about trans men, but I related to over a handful of it. \n\nI noticed that a sign of gender dysphoria or just a sign that you could be transgender in general is having a general discomfort with life. Well, not exactly general, but you just feel so uncomfortable with literally everything. \n\nI\u2019m uncomfortable with my body, uncomfortable with the way I live and where I live, and it\u2019s just an overall feeling of being uncomfortable. It just doesn\u2019t feel right. Nothing feels right. I\u2019ve noticed how I feel when people refer to me as a girl and part of the time it\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019m gonna act like that didn\u2019t happen\u201d and other times it\u2019s like \u201cI hate this don\u2019t say my name don\u2019t say that\u201d I keep those feelings to myself though. The idea of being referred to as a male is a little uncomfortable and I\u2019ve done it multiple times. I end up feeling scared and uncomfortable and I turn back. I believe that could be because I\u2019m not used to it and I\u2019m afraid that they may find it weird and still see me as a girl. \n\nI have a friend who is ftm and we\u2019re very close. He always lets me ask him questions and I asked him if he felt uncomfortable and nervous about wearing boxers at first. He said yes but he got used to it and now cannot imagine wearing panties again. I hate panties and have never worn them but I think I\u2019d wanna try wearing boxers somehow. I just wanna take small steps to see what feels the most right and what makes me feel better. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering if anyone else has felt the general dissatisfaction with life and felt uncomfortable from just existing. Possibly even felt paranoid or this unexplainable sense of dread that you\u2019ll die. Maybe it\u2019s the news that\u2019s making me feel this way. I just wanna know if I\u2019m not alone.

I was smoking weed and watching a really old TV show. Often, weed combined with something from my childhood will trigger these *very* vivid memories.

I spent about one hour trying to connect with my sense of gender from back then... Nothing.

Since I was about 19 I started identifying as non-binary. That worked while I was studying because I could just wear and act however I wanted but then I graduated and had to get a real job. I grew a beard and started acting more masc to fit in with the kind of people I work with. (Coming out as trans at work is gonna be HELL but that\u2019s for future me to worry about.) So the acting manly thing really triggered some dysphoria and discomfort for me. I thought maybe I just wanted to present as NB more often (I use they/them pronouns) but, long story short, I\u2019m a woman.\n\nI\u2019ve come out to a few close friends and it\u2019s been amazing. They\u2019ve been so supportive and helpful and caring and it\u2019s made me feel incredible. Obviously I\u2019m a long way off HRT or any procedures, but I have an appointment with my doctor to get the ball rolling soon.\n\nMy problem is the interaction I had with my partner when I came out to her (cis woman, been together 7 years). She\u2019s always been accepting of and comfortable with me identifying as NB but I\u2019m starting to think that comes down to how masc I was presenting because of work and where I live. She doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m trans. She is happy to be in a relationship with a woman and if I could flick a switch tomorrow and wake up a cis woman, she\u2019s still be here and happy.\n\nBut she\u2019s worried about our safety and how she\u2019s going to have to approach her family. We may have to move because of the area we live in. Her family and our neighbours think I\u2019m just a cis man because who has time for the NB conversation with obvious bigots? But I want to be an out trans woman. I want to present as a woman in public and at family events. And this seems to make her very uncomfortable. I understand the safety issue because I might have a hard time passing (big chin, like 3-foot shoulders and I have to shave my face twice a day), but I tried to convince her it\u2019s all a long way off and I haven\u2019t even spoken to a doctor yet. But for me it\u2019s getting more and more real and I want things to move as quickly as possible. How do I make her feel OK? I told her I understood if she didn\u2019t want to go through all this and that I\u2019d understand if she wanted to leave. Her life shouldn\u2019t have to get worse because of me, but she says \u201cI\u2019m gonna have to do it because I love you\u201d. Which was nice to hear but it feels like I\u2019m forcing her into a different, dangerous life where she might have to cut ties with her family. \n\nTL;DR my partner is worried about me publicly presenting as a woman because of her safety and family.

I think I\u2019m goin through a bit of an identity crisis right now, and friends always help with that. Please read to the end for a fuller understanding of where I\u2019m coming from.\n\nWhen I got to college I did what many do with their newfound freedom, I began to push the boundaries I previously had living in a conservative home and began to form my own identity apart from my family. I was attending a Christian college on a dance scholarship. I had been dancing ballet for almost a decade at that point, which meant I grew up with people assuming I was gay. I have never been attracted to men, so that was pretty problematic. I had mostly girl friends and few girlfriends. Anyway, at college I met a girl, Mona, online. She was from California, where I was from, and we seemed to have a lot in common. The hours I wasn\u2019t spending doing school things or playing video games or dancing, we were talking. I began to think of her as my girlfriend. The problem was she only ever sent me 3 photos of herself, the same 3, whenever I asked. I sent her many, she sent only 3. Red flag, I know, with hindsight, but I began to love that person I messaged everyday. At first I thought that maybe she had gained weight or something had happened to where she didn\u2019t feel comfortable sending more recent or candid photos.\n\nEventually she began suggesting things. She maintained that she was a cisgender, heterosexual woman, however she would suggest I experiment with my roommates or ask if I had ever thought of sucking dick, along with many other things. Now, as I said, I came from a very conservative home, but grew up in the ballet world, meaning I really had no objection to anyone\u2019s sexual orientation or identity, I just identified, at the time, as strictly hetero, and I felt like we were in a relationship together, at least that\u2019s how I viewed it, so the thought of sexually experimenting with anyone else was out of the question. Eventually I began to connect the dots and had to confront the feelings I had. She kept suggesting trying things that can\u2019t be done with the female body, and she would only send me the same 3 pictures over and over again. I realized that she was either very open minded and for some reason wouldn\u2019t ever send new pictures, or that she was a trans woman or gay man that didn\u2019t feel comfortable sharing more of themselves yet. \n\nTo this day I don\u2019t know what became of Mona. What I do know is that I came to the conclusion that regardless of her gender or sexual identity, whatever she looked like, I had come to know her. I loved her personality and her playfulness, her openness and how she honestly cared for me while we were getting to know each other. I came to the realization that whatever I thought my sexual identity to be, it had expanded to let her in. Whatever the whole truth was I was in love and it didn\u2019t matter to me. But we lost contact, and my biggest regret is that I never had the opportunity to express all of that to her and that at the end of our 2 or 3 year correspondence I still hadn\u2019t helped her feel comfortable enough in me or us for her to share all of herself with me.\n\nThat was.... 8 or 9 years ago. Since then I\u2019ve been married, had kids, and am now separated. Since meeting Mona, from mostly my inability to fully articulate what I felt or who I was afterward, because i am most definitely changed, my marriage struggled and Ive felt so conflicted for so long. My wife was born into the same religion I was, and we had tried to practice it especially after our kids were born, but one of the biggest things that shook me with regards to my identity was qualifying my experience with what I had been taught growing up about the LGBTQ community. Homosexuality is obviously taboo with conservative Christians, and the basis for that is a terrible and completely ignorant assumption that sexual and gender identity is purely a choice for those who don\u2019t conform to cisgender norms, and that any act outside of that very small circle of understanding is a conscious rebellion against God. In other words, they disregard the concept that any member of the LGBTQ community can love like they do. They demean every single non-heteronormative relationship to it\u2019s basest level as purely physical and therefore immoral. But I have loved a woman, and I have loved Mona. It felt just as impactful and life changing, I got the same butterflies, and both made me a better person. \n\nSo here I am! Completely alone after 8 years of marriage, I don\u2019t know what to believe with regards to my faith that I really do cherish and I don\u2019t exactly know how I identify now. I know I do believe there is a God, and I believe God loves everyone regardless of who they are, how they identify, what race or religion they are, whatever. I know that whatever my next relationship will be, whether a cisgender woman or a trans woman, I will love them with equal fervor and hopefully as a more aware and whole partner. So what am I? Where do I fit in? Who are my people? Because the things I know now are not things that the people I have as friends or family now agree with. \n\nThis has been a whole bunch of emotional vomit....I apologize. But any advice or support or friendship would be so very appreciated. Please be kind, if I said anything offensive or ignorant, please let me know politely, I have never shared this story with anyone at all. \n\nThis is me https://i.imgur.com/Qj0UKO7.jpg \n\npm me, and be gentle....", "date": "2018-07-13 01:07:11", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/8yfjxr/need_a_friend/", "author": "nvrnosbst"}, {"title": "What is it like for other FtM who are into older (5-10yrs) women?", "text": "It is already easy to get shot down by an older woman as it is, but as a FtM it makes it even more difficult so far.

I grew up with three older sisters, my mother, and her rather *unkind* husband after my dad passed away. I always found myself wishing to play with my sister\u2019s Barbies and dolls, or watching girly movies and TV shows with them. In school, I always hung out with girls almost exclusively - I never trusted guys, and being around them made me feel uncomfortable, like I didn\u2019t belong.\n\nMy family has always been relatively accepting and understanding of my femininity. They always asked me growing up if I were gay, or if I realized how \u201cgirly\u201d I acted, etc. At school, I was typically bullied, called a fag/queer, and generally found myself unhappy in my surroundings. I should point out that while I consider myself to be bisexual, I\u2019ve never been with another man - even though I think I would be accepted at this point, it\u2019s never been an opportunity and right now I am engaged to a woman.\n\nI had never considered the possibility that I\u2019m trans until relatively recently. I have OCD, and found myself frequently having trans thoughts, which led to suppression of these feelings, and an intense depression. I always assumed the thoughts were a side effect of OCD, as I tend to panic myself over everything.\n\nLast month, however, I went to a mental health clinic and was prescribed Zoloft. Now, for the first time ever, I\u2019m thinking clearly about myself and who I am.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of medication, I began to notice something - my gender confusion was still there, but the negative thoughts I had associated with it were gone. I recalled memories of growing up and feeling in my mind that I associated far more with girls than I ever did with boys. Some highlights of my memories are when I took some dumb MySpace gender quiz around age 12 and got a result that my brain was 83% female or something, or one time when my sister referred to me as \u201cpretty.\u201d I thought about all of this for a few days, and then I had a connect-the-dots moment that really threw me for a loop: For the first time, I had seriously considered that I may be transgender.\n\nI, admittedly, had never been too understanding of transgenderism. I always thought it was just a personality crisis, I didn\u2019t understand when people say they \u201cfelt\u201d like they were in the wrong body, and I didn\u2019t understand how anyone could feel comfortable with themselves about it.\n\nBut now, it\u2019s all I can think about - all of my free time this week has comprised of me pricing treatments, or looking at progress photos, or reading stories of other people coming to terms with it. My scared feelings regarding my gender identity have completely vanished, and now I feel nothing but excitement. I get butterflies in my stomach any time I think about transitioning, and I\u2019ve been incredibly distracted by my own thoughts of how I would look as a woman.\n\nI am still confused, though. At this point, I feel that I *am* trans, but I\u2019m frankly terrified to tell anyone. I have no idea how my fianc\u00e9e would take it, and I feel like my family would disown me. I\u2019m sure these feelings are not unique to me, so I would really appreciate some advice on how I should go about handling this situation I\u2019ve found myself in. I\u2019m now at the point where I am comfortable with myself and having these feelings, but I just don\u2019t know how anyone else will take it, and that\u2019s what scares me. I\u2019ve felt an unprecedented happiness in these thoughts that I\u2019ve never had before - it feels like I\u2019m falling in love again.\n\nCan you guys please provide some advice?

Throughout my entire life I can remember being drawn to more \"boyish\" things. One thing that I remember specifically from when I was pretty young (6 or 7 or so)  is that whenever I would \"play pretend\" I would almost always act as a male. Also, according to my aunt, I would a lot of times say that when I grow up I wanted to be a boy lol.  \n\nFor awhile I blew most of these things off as being a tomboy, but for some time now I've been feeling different. Moving into my teen years I started feeling very uncomfortable with the more feminine aspects of my body, especially my breasts, and I have always wanted to get rid of them and to have a flat chest. This desire has only grown as I've gotten older. Something else that really brought on these thoughts was when I was buying some new clothes a couple weeks ago.

So I am a lovely lesbian who has recently moved to a new state and after getting involved in the LGBT community here (in a much bigger city than where I am from) I've made a few new trans friends (yeah!). I hadn't ever met any trans people before, so I was excited for the opportunity, but now I have a question about something I've noticed!\n\nAnyway. So these new friends are still just that, new, so we are all getting to know each other but already I've noticed one thing about the trans folk in the community that seems different than the rest of us. So with my lesbian or gay friends, we talk about sex, who we are attracted to, and swap risqu\u00e9 stories ect. just like what the average mid-twenty year olds do. But the trans people in our group aren't always as vocal about themselves, and the participate in the conversation only when its in involving somebody else. After talking with some people about why it seems discussing sex in the trans community almost feels like taboo, because to me thats sorta what it felt like!, most everyone said something like \"well they are going through so much physically/emotionally ect. that we never wanted to push them, or make them feel uncomfortable.\"\n\nWell I feel like not feeling comfortable to talk/ask about it amongst friends is awful!!! I love having the comfortability to just joke, or share or whatever you feel comfortable with about your sex life with my buddies.\n\nSo my question is this. What would be the best way to bring up sexuality to a new trans friend? I am getting to know these folks really well, and even if they don't want to be as vocal about sex, I still want them to feel comfortable enough to feel like they could share with me if they wanted to! I think all love is beautiful, but I also don't want to offend them by just straight up asking \"so if you are a trans man, who do you like?\"\n\nBut then also part two of the question. Is there any research about the tendencies of the trans community? Like, or most trans-men gay, or straight and the same for trans-women. Just curious!\n\nAny insight would be much appreciated!

AFAB here, age 15 (soon to be 16, *woot woot*). Recently, I've been having a lot of thoughts about transgenderism, and how it relates to me.\n\nEver since I can remember, I've always *WONDERED* what it's like to be a boy. I chalked it up to being curious, as every girl must be. The farthest memory I have of this is being about 3 or 4 and trying to picture my room if I'd gotten rid of all my tiaras, girly beanie babies, etc and replaced it with boys' toys--imagining if I was a boy. But, this didn't really stick and didn't seem too significant at the time. I grew up being okay with being female. I identified as female.\n\nBut, when I found out about sex, I didn't want to have a penis go into my vagina. I wanted to be the one with the penis. I wanted to play that part. These thoughts have always kind of been there but I haven't really made a big deal about them. I remember at one point, though, later in my adolescence, pretending that I had a penis really excited me. But, once again, I kind of just let these thoughts go.\n\nSince about age 10, I've been interested in FTM transgender individuals, and really admired their transitions. I kind of envied them, at times. I, verily, gave the idea a bit of thought, but more or less without myself in the equation. I imagined what it would be like to be transgender, but more about being male in general. The strong jawline, the shoulders, the beard, the hair, the voice, the way they dress...their penises. It was less about wanting to be with one than it was about BEING one. But not me, I was sure. Not in this lifetime. The thoughts, as always, drifted to the back of my head and stayed there, out of the spotlight for a long time.\n\nWhen I was about 13-14, I went through a process of trying to define my sexuality (after a LONG, ugly, depressing internal battle, I rested upon queer, knowing that I like women and men, but how much of either often changes). For awhile, I was primarily attracted to women. But, when paying mind to queer media, for some reason, I always identified more with gay men (stick with me here). While identifying as a female, a relationship with a male doesn't seem very desirable to me. I don't really like that dynamic. But, when I imagine being with a male AS a male, it just feels so...right. I get these really strong butterflies when I see two men together, almost as if I'M the one experiencing this. This is sort of silly, but at one point, I was really sad that I wasn't born as a man because I would never be able to have this sort of relationship. It was the point where I figured in some other life, I would be born a boy so I could happily be with one. As female, I'm currently with a female, but I'm beginning to question if this is really fulfilling for me--if it's what I want. I know that even if I remain a female, I will always wish that I was a man that was with a man. Is that weird????\n\nAND FINALLY, now. How am I fairing now? Well, a few weeks ago, whilst on vacation, I watched this movie called \"God's Own Country,\" which is about a male v. male relationship. I literally felt so connected to this dynamic, to the beingness of these two cis-gendered men, that it literally frightened me a little bit. Almost if this is the narrative I'm supposed to be living, but am not because I stupidly imagined that I'll just have to be female until I die and become a man in some hypothetical reincarnation lol. I started wondering if it's possible that I might be...transgender. A strange inquisition for me. It felt funny, weird, but very exciting to ponder this about...myself? Yes, me. What if I, a troubled 15 year-old, might be transgender? YIPES idk.\n\nEver since I've done more reading about it, finally applying it to myself, the idea has absolutely psyched me up. The idea of being a boy is so thrilling and exciting and...*right*. But, I don't, and haven't really ever, struggled with strong dysphoria. Little bits here and there, sure, but never to the point where I HATED being female. Actually, I've never hated the fact that I am, biologically, female. It still doesn't really BOTHER me, it's just more or less something I wish I just wasn't. But, if I was never able to transition, I think I would be okay, just probably really bummed and I would most likely just fantasize about it. Does this mean I might just be projecting this fantasy onto past experiences that create this FTM narrative? I haven't ever explicitly thought I was a boy trapped in a girl's body until recently. But even now, I don't feel super suffocated or whatever. I just feel like I would RATHER be a boy, but if I HAD to be a girl, I would be okay. (Sorry for the repetitiveness, I'm a bit jumbled atm). Am I trans? Will this pass? I don't want it to, but will it? Is this normal? Am I just creating this? Please help.\n\ntl;dr\n\nI think i might be trans, have had some trans-centered thoughts throughout my life, never took it seriously. haven't had strong dysphoria but i really wish i was a male.", "date": "2018-07-26 19:50:25", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/925jlz/help_am_i_trans/", "author": "SafeBreadfruit"}, {"title": "My first gender therapy session", "text": "So I just got home from my first therapy session and it was great!

I'm a 28 year old male who has just recently started to explore my sexuality I guess. I'm in a hard place atm I broke up with my gf of 3 years more than a year and a half ago. Prior to that I have had one sexual encounter with a transgender woman which didn't involve oral just receiving head. I felt a lot of guilt and shame for what I did and when my girlfriend at the time broke up with me I literally had a breakdown over the span of a year. Two suicide attempts one of which I actually died for a few minutes. High anxiety and a cocktail of medications. I've always considered myself straight and I am genuinely interested in woman but also am attracted to feminine transgender woman as well. I have never been one to judge other's be it sexuality religion or skin colour. I came on this site to see if anyone has been in a similar situation at all? And if anyone has some advice on the matter? I recently met a girl that I really like and I hope I haven't stuffed thing's up. I'm a overthinker and my own worst critic self esteem is really low and I find myself doing things I wouldn't normally do such as looking for transgender escorts online. In saying that I haven't done that in the past before ever. And I don't condone the industry at all. I've tried multiple times to quit pornography as I feel it's subjecting to all woman transgender or not. I feel low down highly anxious and depressed. I would just like to get better and try to find someone who is understanding and non judgemental. I fear that if I told this to the girl I like she'll think I'm a freak in some way. Guess I also worry about what other's think more than what I do of myself. Any advice would be much appreciated I would also like to say I genuinely don't feel I'm closeted or hiding I don't find men attractive not even 1%.

It started when I was six, back when I was a good southern boy and still prayed to God. I remember, quite vividly, praying for him to make me a girl. By my six year old logic it made absolutely no sense for me to be a boy. All my friends were girls, all my favorite toys were stereotypically feminine, and I didn't really have any interests in \"male\" activities (e.g. sports). Hell, I would even occasionally dress up in my older sister's clothes. Safe to say, even at a young age I was pretty sure God fucked up.\n\nMy teen years were spent in a weird social grey area  where I was both simultaneously too mentally feminine to get along with most men (absolutely zero common interests) but also too physically masculine to be fully accepted by most women (I was still a horny teenage boy after all). I had an inkling that something was a miss, but at the time I didn't have the words and tools necessary to really comprehend it. Furthermore, I was fairly successful in the dating game (by teenage standards) so I was content enough to tuck the thoughts and way and ignore them as long as this continued to be true. If I tried to \"fix\" myself by acting more masculine, I would probably just alienate my female friends even further while failing to make any male ones. So fuck it, if isn't broke then don't fix it.\n\nThis mentality continued to be my dominate paradigm until I married my wife when I was 23. I don't know if it was because I was in a more socially secure relationship, because I was a little older and more mature, or what but in the first year of marriage I had a sexual awakening where I realized something wasn't quite right. Right off the bat I knew I wasn't gay. I had experimented with that when I was younger and it wasn't really my thing. I eliminated transgender quickly after that because I figured, quite wrongly, if I was then I would have figured that out by now; that if I had made it this far in life being male....ish then that was simply what I was. So I went through a multiyear phase of being a revolving door of sexual interests. Polyamory! BDSM! Various other niche subcultures! To my wife's enormous credit she put up with me as I searched for myself until last year I hit a dead end. I had tried a lot of new things and none of them really felt like me. I just resigned myself to being broken.\n\nThen comes this summer, whereupon I discover the world of indie adult (read: pornographic) video games/visual novels. Most of them really aren't to my taste, but one of them centered itself around the premise of navigating the trials and tribulations that come with growing up as a teenage girl and discovering your sexuality. In just about every sense that one could judge a game by it was horrible, and the English translation from its native Russian was at times laughably bad.  But there was something about it that scratched an itch that I had been clawing away at for years. I became somewhat addicted, constantly playing not only this game but any and every game that had a female protagonist. Gradually, I made the transition from playing random women and instead starting inserting a feminized version of myself into the narratives. I still don't quite understand it, but this fantasy experience of my womanly alter ego discovering herself was by far the most emotionally and sexually gratifying experience of my life. Unlike everything else I had tried, it felt genuine. Authentic. Like me.\n\nSo we come to tonight, where by chance I happen upon a post from r/transtimelines. Transitioning isn't a foreign concept to me in that I have friends and family who have done both MtF and FtM, but there was something about this post that touched me on a deep, visceral level. Maybe it was because I had spent the last 2 months unknowingly priming myself for this moment but the realization overwhelmed me. This woman who I was a staring at, who had completed her transition to MtF, I wanted to be her. Not her specifically, but I wanted to accomplish what she had accomplished. This deeply disturbs me. I don't want this problem. I don't want to put my wife and family through this. I immediately told her all of this and none of this really caught her by surprise. She is generally supportive, and I love her deeply for that, but I can't help but be torn in that it simultaneously feels so right and so wrong. I keep thinking to myself, \"Why couldn't God have just gotten it right?\"\n\nI don't know what to do at this point. I know I need to talk to someone, I want to talk to someone, but I am afraid that by doing so I make this real. I make this into a thing. I could ignore it when I still didn't understand what it was, but now that I do....I can't. A part of me really really wants to ignore it though. I don't know how to feel about any of this, so that's why I am here.

A year ago I wouldn't have dreamed of spending money on something like that, but I was so happy when I bought it. \n\nI still have body image issues I'm working on, but I really feel like I am making significant strides in improving my life.

The other subs seemed to have stricter rules, and I fear I would've been banned for \"stirring the pot\" or whatever. If you know a better one, I'd appreciate to be redirected. \n\nSo this is a long one. I'll try not to be offensive but this has been on my mind for so long now. I really need to get it out. \n\nI'm currently 25. AMAB. Always been socially awkward, a \"loser\", loner but not by choice. Autsitc. Trouble making friends, even more trouble keeping them. Basically a failure in every sense of the word. [Pretty close to this.](https://imgur.com/skjcfWN)\n\nOne thing I notice is that I rarely ever find AFAB like this at all. I've made similar rants in a few other places. Some people claim they have known AFAB \"basement dweller\" types. Any I've know who came close to that- they had an excuse. Sexual assault/abuse as a child or teen. Early pregnancy and the family helps care for the child. AMAB almost never have reasons except social failure and rejection- I'd even call it social abuse, because that's what it is.\n\nA few trans women have replied to my previous rants and said it has to do with how damaging it is being raised male. Of course, any posts pointing this out are sometimes met by cis women being dismissive and saying *\"But being women is tougher!!\"*. I just hate how it always has to be a competition. It's not. Can't we just post about how damaged we are from forced maleness onto us, without anyone trying to shoot down our traumatic experiences?\n\nI've had dysphoria since I was a young child, in one way or another, but the thing is- I never had physical dysphoria badly. The thought of things like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth were just scary to me, especially since I'm very squeamish (and yes I know not all cis women do those things). Occasionally I did have desires for breasts and a vagina, but I don't know if it was just to \"fit\" my social dysphoria. \n\nMy most prominent dysphoria is social. I just feel like my life would be so much better if people saw me as a woman. The few times I lived near any trans groups and was able to present and be referred to as she/her, it just felt way better.\n\n As a socially awkward male-presenting AMAB, especially one who isn't overly masculine and doesn't feel the need to present as such, I get seen as creepy, awkward, possibly a pedo or sex offender, and I'm none of that. I'm not seen as someone to be social with. \n\nI understand why. I understand that many people have been hurt by cis men (self included). I understand it's perfectly reasonable to have that fear there. \n\nBut the biggest pain is that other AMAB see me that way too. You'd think there'd be some empathy there? No, of course not. Cis men, especially straight ones, want zero fuck all to do with me. Most of the few \"friends\" I had stopped being such when I came out, or even before then for other really petty reasons.\n\nIt really irks me when cis men talk about women \"being catty\" and always fighting with each other... yeah right! Way to show off your own insecurities, *bro*. As if every male friend I had didn't leave me in the dust for the most petty reason imaginable. \n\nI'm not gonna say that trans/masc AFAB don't have it difficult too. I don't know what it's like. But whenever I meet people like myself (on the internet, usually), they're always AMAB. \n\nI have to wonder if being AFAB makes things easier to socialize and keep lasting interpersonal relationships. I'll never know. I just know that whatever I am, is not seen as someone worth any of that stuff. \n\nAnd I know for a fact that it's the way males treat each other. I'm not saying that women just sit around hugging each other. But everything from a male is always telling me to toughen up, always trying to bully me. If it is nice, it's because he sees me as a sexual object. \n\nEven the *supposed* advantages of being AMAB... like physical strength? I never had that! I took co-ed gym classes most of my life... I was easily one of the worst performing students, if not the worst. Would being AFAB had made it easier on me? I don't know, because even as AMAB, I could not reach what the fitness test minimum for AFAB were anyway. But, as insulting as this is, the lowered expectations would have benefited me a ton. \n\nWhen a cis woman gets applauded for lifting something heavy, meanwhile I'm expected to lift double and if I can't, I get downright humiliated and verbally abused. Any job I get (the minimum wage slave labor willing to hire me), I have all these physical expectations hurled at me. Any complaints I make about this get met with a victim-blaming *\"Go to the gym, bro!\"*.\n\nNot even just that- men say that I'm supposed to be \"more emotionally stable\" than a woman? Yeah right. I'm bipolar and I'm a mess. They can go on about the supposed advantages of being AMAB- I got absolutely none of em. I feel like a failure.\n\nThe AFAB I talk to- cis women, trans men, non-binary, gender queer, all others- seem very well adjusted in life, or at least, way more than me. They have their group of stable friends, and have for a while. Most don't have trouble getting dates if they desire. Most have an actual career, or are working on getting one. They have a light at the end of the tunnel- a life set up to promise things may end up okay.\n\nI could never even dream of that. I'll likely never have any of that. I think I'm just too damaged at this point.

I've always been more on the stereotypically feminine side. I've always preferred female friends over male ones, and I've always had a deep appreciation for things that, traditionally, are meant for women. I've dressed in women's clothing, and while I wouldn't have admitted it then (it was supposedly a joke), I really enjoyed it. Despite all that, I've always been a man.\n\nThat said, I've also hated my body for as long as I remember. I'm naturally pretty hairy, and I was always heavier. I chalked up my dislike to that. However, over the last couple of years, I've lost a lot of weight, and I started removing my body hair, and while that helped, it made me think even more and more about my body. I want to be pretty. I want to wear dresses and have curves. Today, I decided I wanted to look at dresses on Amazon, and I almost cried because I want one so badly, but I'm scared to admit it to anyone. I asked my boyfriend (who is bi) in passing whether he would be ok dating a trans person, and he said he would, but at the same time, he was a bit uncomfortable a while back when we started talking about the idea of crossdressing. Or at least it seemed that way. That scares me. I'm sure if it came down to it, he would accept me , but I'm not sure what it would mean for our relationship.\n\nOn top of all that, I do like my penis. It's not something that grosses me out or something that I don't feel is part of me. That makes me question whether it's really that I'm trans or if I'm just genderfluid. To be honest, this isn't the first time I've questioned my gender identity. Less than a year after coming out as gay, I mentioned in passing to a close female friend of mine \u2013 let's call her Elise \u2013 that sometimes I feel more comfortable with the idea of femininity. The conversation went something like this:\n\n&gt;Me: You know, sometimes I'm jealous of women. I want to look like that. Is that weird?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elise: What? Are you saying you're trans?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Me: ... I don't know...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elise: \\*panicking slightly\\* What?... You're not serious.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elise: ...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Elise: I can't deal with this right now.\n\nI can't even begin to tell you how much that hurt. I worry about what others might think if I decided to transition. Where I live, it's bad enough being gay. i mean, it's not terrible here, but the amount of judgement and disapproving stares I get already is more than enough. On top of that, a trans man was beaten to death two years ago in my state's most progressive city.\n\nThere are so many things going through my mind right now, and I'm not sure how to process them. thank you, r/trans, for listening to/reading the chaos that's erupting from my brain. I'd greatly appreciate any resources you might be able to share.

I will try to be concise.\n\nI\u2019m AMAB. Growing up I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m a boy and how to act like one. That never necessarily bothered me. However, there have been some things on rare occasions which I look back on and think that I may have not been paying attention to the subtleties. My mother told me that when I was very young, I had said to her once that I\u2019m a girl and I\u2019m going to wear makeup. Now idk if that meant anything. My mom said I was laughing and she said I told her that in a joking manner. Another time (early teens) I remember thinking \u201cI wonder what it would be like to be a girl\u201d. I actually said it out loud and my mom looked at me with strange eyes and said \u201cthat\u2019s weird\u201d. At the time, it was just a passing thought and that\u2019s what I had told her.\n\nI\u2019ve put on nail polish before because I thought it would be fun (early teens). It was clear nail polish and my mom had put it on for me and for my brother. I only did it once because I thought to myself \u201cboys shouldn\u2019t like this I can\u2019t do that again\u201d or something to that affect. Sometimes when I\u2019ve jerked off about having sex with girls, I\u2019d imagine myself in there position.\n\nI don\u2019t have a problem with my dick, I like it very much. But I have thought about what it would feel like to have a vagina. I\u2019ve thought about how it would be nice if I could have both, though I know that isn\u2019t realistic (hot-swappable genitals sounds great tbh). I don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with my body as it is, but I noticed that I don\u2019t really like body hair all that much. I started shaving/trimming/grooming my chest (late high school) and (once again mentioning her) my mom saw and asked if I was gay (I\u2019m bi but I didn\u2019t find that out till later on).\n\nI\u2019ve only recently started questioning my gender (I\u2019m in my early 20s). Idk how dysphoria should affect me and how it should feel. I\u2019ve thought about it a good bit and think I\u2019m genderqueer. I\u2019m not opposed to my assigned gender completely, but I definitely don\u2019t fit in it 100%. I\u2019ve thought about having a more feminine body. I like the idea of having curves and boobs. I like the idea of wearing feminine clothing. I\u2019ve never really cross dressed, but it\u2019s something I want to try. I\u2019ve worn female underwear before and it felt good. I\u2019ve tried to wear some of my gfs clothes, but I can\u2019t fit into them properly without fear of tearing them. I was in a musical once as an extra and had to wear makeup. It wasn\u2019t that bad, but it did feel weird a little since it was my first time. That being said, I\u2019d probably prefer more of an androgynous look with a more feminine undertone?

A bit of context, my mother is disabled and is quickly heading to a future where she won\u2019t be able to live on her own or care for herself adequately. She\u2019s been in the hospital for the last few days and a social worker had been assigned to her and has been in frequent contact with my family about my mom. \n\nI have not had any direct interaction with this social worker, nor do I anticipate having any interaction with them because I live a very long ways away from where my mother lives and her sisters and brother are the main decision makers in this situation. \n\nMy aunts have been forwarding all of the emails that have been sent between them and this social worker in order to keep me in the loop, which I really appreciate but in one email I was listed as one my mother\u2019s family contacts under my dead name and listed as her daughter.\n\nI legally changed my name and came out to my family years ago as male and have on multiple occasions interacted with my family and have been referred to as my legal name. My mother also knows about my name change and that I\u2019m trans and despite suffering from the steady degeneration of her mental capacity she still manages to not purposefully misgender me and actually corrects herself when she slips up! \n\nI don\u2019t really think there\u2019s much I can do in this situation unfortunately. I\u2019m certainly debating emailing the family member and telling them that they deliberately misinformed a professional about one of their clients family/emergency contacts but I don\u2019t want to make the situation about me when my mom is really the person who needs my help and attention.

I\u2019m wanted to see if anyone may have had a similar situation that could offer some words of encouragement or advice. \n\nI\u2019ve been struggling with the idea that i feel like a guy. For a very long time. I first started thinking it when I was 12 years old. It wasn\u2019t just simply that I liked sports or was more like my father... it was just a feeling. Of course, I was 12 and born in the 80s so the idea of being a transgender or having gender issues wasn\u2019t even a thought. I contemplated that maybe I was a lesbian but then realized I really couldn\u2019t handle girls emotions and I wasnt attracted to them. \n\nAs I grew older I simply ignored it. Just lived my life. I found myself married, and just happened to marry a guy who was more into guys. Liked my personality but not my body. Never blamed him. I found myself in a male industry as a job. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though, I have long hair. I get my nails done. It\u2019s not that I love these things, it just suits my body and my look. I have big hips. A pear shape body and a round face which short hair doesn\u2019t suit me at all. Also, I like men. \n\nOnce I started researching more about transgenders I really felt like this screamed at me. I feel like I am a different person in a body that doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m not ugly. I don\u2019t have a bad body. I have had an amazing life. My parents and friends would all be accepting. There\u2019s just so many confusing factors. \nI like doing some of the things that comes with being a women, especially playing on women sports leagues, as I\u2019ve tried coed and can never match men skill level. \n\nMy best friends all know my struggle and some of them see it but some of them don\u2019t. \nFor example when I simply mentioned this to my Mom she said they\u2019d love me and support me no matter what but my personality and hobbies and the things I do don\u2019t really show that I\u2019ve been suffering with this for so long (example: the long hair, nails, getting my eyelashes done, wearing dresses, being into men, liking girlie movies and shows...when I was a kid I played with dolls, etc) \n\nOne of my friends thought maybe I just didn\u2019t like my body (cause I was 20lbs heavier) and if I lost weight and had a body that I felt was more attractive on women maybe I\u2019d be happier? Feel more attractive? Enjoy sex more? So I tried it. I lost not just 20lbs, but 40lbs and I look amazing. It didn\u2019t help. I still am conflicted and suffer from the same problem in my mind. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to have this conversation with someone who doesn\u2019t understand. My Mom was right about how \u201cgirlie\u201d I could be as a kid. But at the same time that doesn\u2019t mean those things felt right. I don\u2019t feel like this is my body... I don\u2019t like sex because I don\u2019t like that part of my body... I\u2019ve thought about ending my life to take it all away but as I\u2019ve mentioned - I do have a pretty good life. And I\u2019d never do that to my loved ones. \n\nI know if it was as easy as snapping my fingers or switching a light I would do it. But I\u2019ve always been afraid that because of how I\u2019ve lived my life maybe I\u2019m wrong about myself. Maybe I could learn to be happy in my body. I often think I\u2019m way too old to start this journey so I should just focus on accepting me for me. \n\nIt hasn\u2019t worked. I\u2019ve gone to therapy, but because how I look they always just give me anxiety or depression medication and don\u2019t seem to take me seriously. \n\nI just want to know if anyone has had this kind of experience. I am tired of living my life like this I want to be able to enjoy all the amazing things I have in my life. Instead of slowly losing interest and slowly losing myself with this confusion. \n\nSorry for the novel. \n\n", "date": "2018-08-14 17:01:02", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/97a3cw/confused_and_need_advice/", "author": "confusedAFahh"}, {"title": "Work discrimination yay....help?!", "text": "So, I work for a company that's supposed to be diverse and inclusive.

It has gotten more and more intense as time has gone by and I don't know where the ceiling is.

If they aren't feeling it, I litterally have to get away from them because wanting their attention and affection so badly for long periods of time can be sorta painful. This started recently and before I could just talk myself out of it but now I can't. If I start crushing I get all blushy and just want cuddles and kisses so bad that my body starts intensely tingling all over. The only way to stop this is to leave the area completely.

You're constantly thinking about it, questioning yourself, looking for answers, worrying about the future.\n\nYou end up depressed because you can't focus on doing anything you love, you're so wrapped up in who you're trying to be and what you're trying to achieve that you can forget to just be you and do the things you love.\n\nYa'll need that reset so you can get back to facing life with a fresh, clear mind that's not exhausted. \n\nA lot of you might be like, **\"How do I just stop thinking about it?\"** and for you, meditation is gonna be your best friend.\n\nI suggest downloading Headspace and using the 10 day free trial as a starter course on how to meditate. From here you can either continue on doing mindful meditation on your own, pay for the full app, or use Youtube to find other guided meditations.\n\nMeditation will teach you to control your mind, but not just while meditating, but also throughout your day. This is integral in being able to take a mental break, otherwise you can try all the distractions you like, music, TV, video games, your mind will still find a way to get back to what's nagging it if you don't learn to silence it.\n\nIf you can already shut down negative thoughts, that's great, you need to exercise that control.\n\nTry giving yourself assigned break days. Like maybe tuesdays and thursdays are days for you to just get away from the worries, and focus on your current day instead of what's ahead. \n\n- Put on some of your favorite feel-good music and blast it on the way to work. \n\n- Stay away from trans reddit, blog posts etc. and just focus on you. \n\n- Avoid mirrors or anything that could trigger dysphoria or thoughts about your image, and ignore thoughts about your appearance, let them pass. \n\nWhen you come back to it after a break, you'll find you have renewed vigor and positivity, and you're more ready to face those challenges again.

When I was a kid, I was a bit of a tomboy. I played baseball and Pok\u00e9mon, hated pink, the whole shebang. I still wore dresses though, not even begrudgingly. I liked dresses and skirts. \n\nAs I started puberty, I became more feminine and I didn\u2019t mind it. I\u2019m a late bloomer, so I was jealous of all these girls already having their period and all that. I even wanted my chest to grow, because everyone else\u2019s was bigger than mine. I have always disliked my appearance and back then I wished I would just wake up one day and become a pretty girl. I desperately wanted to fit in.\n\nIn around 8th grade I think, the thought that I didn\u2019t feel completely like a girl started. It wasn\u2019t very strong or constant. As high school started, I became almost ultra feminine. I flaunted my body in girly clothes. Something still didn\u2019t feel quite right.\n\nI watch a lot of lgbt films, mostly with gay men. I\u2019d watch these and feel... jealous? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d see these two men falling in love and feel angry and hopeless that I\u2019d never get to be one of them. That I\u2019d never be a man. I thought \u201cI can\u2019t be trans though, I dress like a girl and enjoy it.\u201d So I went on. I also realized that I prefer masculine terms over their feminine counterparts. I didn\u2019t hate being called she, I just thought it didn\u2019t fit. The thoughts would flare up a bit every now and again, but they\u2019d disappear pretty quickly.\n\nThen, almost two months ago, I got my hair cut short. That\u2019s when the thoughts got to their strongest. That\u2019s when I started hating my chest, not because it wasn\u2019t big enough, but because it was too big. It felt wrong. I wore an old sports bra from middle school for days on end, to the point where it hurt. I think it helps to add that I have always hated my genitalia, even before this. It just makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAnyway, I was repulsed by my feminine clothing and chose to wear masculine clothes like button up shirts and hoodies. I felt limited, because I love fashion. I wish I could wear my feminine clothing, but not be seen as a girl.\n\nTime went on and the thoughts lessened some, but about a week ago they flared up a lot more. Now, referring to myself in any feminine terms makes me extremely uncomfortable and if someone were to tell me \u201cyou\u2019re actually a girl\u201d I\u2019d be absolutely heartbroken. A fear of mine is growing up and looking like a woman. I want a deep voice, flat chest, and for people to see me and think I\u2019m a guy.\n\nAm I faking these feelings? It might seem obvious to some, but I\u2019m just afraid of starting something and regretting it. I\u2019m sorry this is so long, I just have a lot on my mind.\n\nEdit: damn I\u2019m stupid lmao I thought reddit was glitching out and not posting this, but I realized that I haven\u2019t been on an account with no karma in forever lol", "date": "2018-08-17 10:15:07", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9812wk/questioning_myself_a_lot/", "author": "transorfakingit"}, {"title": "Is it a bad thing to call Trans guys \"Dude\"?", "text": "I have aways used \"dude\" and \"mate\" when talking to my male friends, trans or not, but I've seen a post on a trans subreddit saying that calling a Trans guy \"dude\" is a bad thing, like as if I was pandering or something like that, can someone explain this to me?", "date": "2018-08-17 19:14:51", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9853xm/is_it_a_bad_thing_to_call_trans_guys_dude/", "author": "MakiceHit"}, {"title": "How do I make my voice sound more feminine?", "text": "My voice is quite deep an masculine at the moment, albeit soft and buttery smooth.

A rain storm will eventually pass.\n\n So I know this title may suggest I'm here trolling but I want to have a genuine conversation about passing and about the ways trans people can be shitty to each other. I personally pass like maybe 2 days out of the year. (No I don't look like a man, I just look transgender) I don't really mind it either. People are still nice to me. People still find me attractive. I still have some dysphoria about parts of my body, but that's my thing.\n\n If you are someone who values passing a lot and wants to attain that, that's fine and I'm rooting for you. I used to pass quite frequently. I would spend 2 hours on my hair and makeup everyday. I practiced my voice everyday. It got to the point that I could talk face to face with cis people who I knew in highschool and they'd have no idea I was trans or that they knew me from somewhere. This was before I started hormones. I just got sick of it after a while. I just wanted to relax. I was tired of working so hard just to get people's respect and feel like I was \"doing it the right way\". I kinda threw out the rule book around 8 months on Hormones.\n\nIf you too have drug the gutters online and you may have found the term HON. This is a nasty word that trans-feminine people will call each other when they aren't passing. It comes from the saying, \" You look great Hon.\" used in a disingenuous way, mocking the \"everyone is beautiful\" ideology. To a degree, yes I would like people to be honest with me about how I look but I also want them to not have a head that's full of garbage.\n\n According to the formula for what make you a hon, I'm all of that. I have a big forehead, wide shoulders, big feet, I'm 6'1\" and I have a deep voice. Do some of these things give me dysphoria? Yes. Does that mean my transition is hopeless and that I'm wasting my time? Hell No! I'm 2 1/2 years on hormones and this is the happiest my life has been. I get treated well in public even when people clock me. On the rare occasion that someone is shitty toward me, that's not a failure on my part, that's just that person's weird  transphobic bullshit. Most people look at me a little curious but then they give me this big warm smile. Cis het men will still tell me I'm beautiful in public. What I'm saying is that I think passing is cool and all, but it doesn't make you any better or that much better off in life. You can be completely non passing and also very beautiful.

I've been trans for a while and Kitty knows &amp; accepts it. I'm still pre-Everything so I set the mental rule that I wouldn't bring it up if they didn't ask. Kitty met me by the train, We walked to her house, met her mother, met her father, met her tio, older brother &amp; they were lovely. Kitty's parents and I went shopping together, Kitty &amp; I went for supplies for her hair, her parents went for pizza. Kitty, Her mother and I went to a little corner market for ingredients for dinner and that's when mama kitty started the typical parental grilling and inspection of the relationship. It was sweet and I'm honestly use to it so I wasn't really nervous. Mama kitty started explaining herself (She didn't have to, but she wanted me to understand where she was coming from) she started talking about her 'son'. I knew that Kitty's 'sister' Honey was trans because I've met her before and she follows me on Instagram. I didn't know how tolerant her family was or how accepting they were but I saw the discomfort in Mama Kitty's face when it came to Honey. Mama kitty started with \"My son- I don't know if you know.\" \"Honey?\" \"Oh so you do know\" \"Yeah, I'm perfectly okay with it, and I'm accepting of it.\" Mama kitty was accepting and understanding too which whew (If you catch my drift). The discourse when it came to Honey wasn't about Honey but her choice in company. Totally understandable. We get back to the house and speak of the devil Honey was right across the street. I nervously smiled under all the new information and mainly because I low key was pleased to be in the presence of a sister. Honey however...no bueno. We got inside and I said hi, shook her hand and proceeded to take a back seat to see exactly what honey was like Kitty being right next to me in all of this. I don't know much about Honey's transition but she looked more masc than I did and I didn't even shave my beard. Honey didn't look trans apart from the fact that she wore a bra and a see through shirt to justify the bra but for the most part it looked like she and I were in the same boat being pre-everything. Do me a favour and imagine the worst stereotype you could for a gay male...That's honey's personality. Upon meeting her and saying Hi there were moments when Honey would disappear and reappear bringing select family members with her. She was blatantly talking shit about me because Mama kitty told me that's what she was doing upon seeing me. Water off my back honestly because Honey doesn't know me and she didn't seem interested in getting to like everybody else. I was in the kitchen with Mama Kitty &amp; Honey; the first thing honey talks about is her hot long sex with her lover the night before. I peeped the very dark and noticeable hickies on Honey's neck. Mama kitty instantly says \"I dont wanna hear it!\" Admittedly it was weird to brag about especially with company present but I laughed along with honey because I genuinely wanted to; and as a sign of \"Yo, I don't have any preconceived notions about you, if your cool I'm cool.\" I watched as Honey made herself a drink. Mama kitty asked her to put it in a plastic cup rather than a glass and it was then that Honey made the comment about spreading gay/trans germs. She does it regardless, leaves, and that's when Mama Kitty turns to me and says she's aware of what Honey is doing and After some back and forth between Honey and everyone else it was clear that Honey was provoking, Extreme, and judgy. She even pulled Kitty away to comment on how feminine of me it was to talk with my hands. Commenting how ugly I was to mama kitty when I wasn't present. Again all water off my back. Soon Honey left and a sense of calm washed over everyone. \n\nHonestly it wasn't a horrible experience but I realised that Honey (along with a select few) are abrasive. I  don't really know much about Honey. So can't really assume they've always been chill about it. I would have loved to honestly get to know her better and like I said I would have been like \"trans? same!\" If we talked at all but it was just very much \"Hi, I know you're here but Imma talk to literally everyone around you\" &amp; \"byeee\" a few hours later. It was fake but I'd rather that honestly. I just hope Kitty's parents grow really fondly of me and come to like me and enjoy my presence before I eventually come out to them. Just so I could set the record straight that not all transwomen are like Honey.

I did everything I could to see if it was just \"a phase\" or that when I \"grew up\" I would feel different about it all. For awhile it did, but more because I was distracted then anything else.\n\nI did so many masculine things trying to... idk... I don't think I was trans so just to feel \"manly\" I guess. I joined the Army, I worked out as much as possible, I tried growing a beard (Tried, its just random hairs poking everywhere) None of it helped and I realized no one ever even treated me as the masculine, manly man. I was always treated like a little brother or someone to care for. In the army people helped me get gear on, cheered me on, picked me up when I fell. I never felt on the same level as the other men.\n\nNow, I'm not saying women can't do that. They can and did. In the army it was really rare for someone not to take care of me physically. I wish I never joined, but that's a whole other thing. I just realized I was never going to be masculine. And the only reason I wanted to be perceived as masculine is because of gender stereotypes. That I should be masculine because my father was. My father in law was. My brothers... eh... kinda? For a bunch of nerds I guess.\n\nI also got married to a wonderful girl, who I have told I feel trans sometimes. She accepts it, but would rather I not transition. And I understand. She's bi, but likes me as a guy and worries if I change, I'll still hate myself. Because there's not really a way to go back, it costs money, and none of our family would accept me. Plus we have a son and I worry in the bible belt, with my family, they may try to take him away because I'm not right in the head or something.\n\nI've been so against gender stereo types. Its been something I've always argued for when people say my music taste is \"girly\" or I'm not \"masculine\" or \"manly\" enough. And yes, I have seen therapists and councilors. The best one I ever went too first thing she asked was do I wish I was a girl. And I said no, I just wish I didn't have to fit the masculine mold. But, I wish I would of said yes.\n\nAnyways, not really any questions I guess, just trying to tell someone. Because I have no one IRL to talk too, and I don't really want more people knowing.

While talking with me was never a problem (pronouns never came up) I listened to my doctor, the assistant, and the front desk attendant use my old pronouns without once correcting themselves (and likely without thinking to). \n\nI'm fairly used to this, especially since I'm in name purgatory (I love my birth name but it's hard to pass), but I really had higher expectations for PP when it came to this stuff. I don't know how to kindly approach them about this, because while I am okay coming back even if it's still problematic, I know that it may discourage other trans people from getting really awesome care because that level of disrespect is pretty significant. I even felt a rush of anxiety and doubt about my validity and I had to get my blood pressure taken a few times because I was so nervous. \n\nWhat's the best way to do this? Letter? Calling?

My biological sex is male. But I have always had a strong feminine side. I have done crossdressing and I have had fantasies and dreams in which I am a girl (or something else than a man). Most of my closest friends have always been women. I just feel more relaxed around them. I am also bisexual but so far only dated women. Almost all of my partners have been bisexuals. One of them loved to put make-up on me. And I really enjoyed it. \n\nAnd even when I was a kid, I behaved often like a girl. I played with dolls and didn't really like things that other boys were doing. I hated sport-classes in school and I never really fit in. Often other guys bullied me. I felt like a complete outsider.\n\nI have also had serious depression and I have been self-destructive. I often just hate myself. I think sometimes that I really aren't man enough and I should just try to be more masculine. Showing femininity makes me feel somehow vulnerable and \"weak\". \n\nNow I am in a some kinda panic, because I really don't know what I want or what I am. And I really don't know what to think about transgenderism. What gender even means? And I know that it's separate from sex, but how? And if i would go through the medical process, would I be enough woman for me? I'm afraid not. I have masculine face and body. I think I should kill myself and be reborn as a female before I could be woman enough in my eyes. I am afraid that after all the hormones and surgieries I would just look like some cheap drag queen... In some way my dream would be a life as a naturally beautiful, normal-looking woman. But I think that's beyond reach. \n\nBut I could live my life as a man. I can go through the cycles of self-hate and depression and survive. But what if I am trans and by getting medical treatment I could have a far more better life? Should I go and do it? Or should I just try to forget everything?

He told me what gender he is transitioning to etc. My brother then said that it was weird for \u201cher\u201d to use the boys\u2019 bathroom. Of course I don\u2019t know the kid well and don\u2019t want to be nosey.

Obviously comparing pronouns to nicknames might have been stupid, but I figured that it was a kid friendly way to get him to understand. I didn\u2019t want to continue the conversation since he is only 12, so I changed the subject.\n\nThen earlier today when we went back to school shopping, he saw the classmate with his family. He went to talk to him and came back saying that were also going back to school shopping, still using female pronouns. Then something went along in the conversation and my mum said \u201ctwo boys and one girl\u201d (meaning the student and the brother and sister). My brother then corrected my mum saying \u201cone boy and two girls\u201d then mentioned that the classmate is transgender. My younger sister (15F) shushed him and we changed the subject again.

Some colleagues and I are looking to collect some preliminary data to help us understand in what ways risk is similar (and different) across a range of diverse populations with elevated suicide rates. Some of these groups overlap with one another quite a bit (e.g. gun owners, law enforcement, active duty military) and some are quite different (e.g. veterinarians, first time new mothers). Our goal is to recruit enough folks to consider groups in isolation or in comparison to one another so that we can understand better how risk shifts in nature from one group to another (and within broader groups that have substantial diversity within them).\n\n\u200b\n\nOne group that has been getting very little attention and whose perspective has been underrepresented in suicide research is the transgender community and I am hoping that individuals who identify as transgender may be willing to take part in this anonymous survey. If you do, some of the items you answer will be ones asked of everyone and some will be unique to the group you indicate that you most identify with. Some of the items are repetitive (sorry...that's an unfortunate reality of scientific research), but we did out best to make the survey both comprehensive and short.\n\n\u200b\n\nKeep in mind that, although this post is specifically seeking individuals who identify as transgender, we would be thrilled to have anyone take part.

I remember when I was younger, I had these thoughts of wanting to become a little girl. I would wear my sisters clothes when she was not home and paint my nails and removed them before anyone got home. I had these thoughts for a few months but they went away. Recently, they have come back. I have dabbled into cross dressing and very much enjoyed it and usually get turned on by doing it. Also when I am watching porn, I usually think of myself as the woman rather than being the man. The thought of being with a man disgusts me rn, but if I think of myself as a woman, it feels good. I also look at other girls sometimes and get jealous. Another thing is that I am in college for nursing, and I feel left out because I am one of the few males in my whole cohort and feel like I would be better fitting if I was female.

It was a very unhealthy obsession. I had to always measure myself against other women. First steps are easy, to look like them, to move like them, to talk like them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut then a cis girl talks to me about sex and I freak out, since I have no idea how girls talk to each other about this stuff. What role do  they think they have in a relationship? For my whole life I've seen the  whole world from a patriarchal perspective and never had those forming  years as a teenage girl to find my place in it. Heck, after 3 years of  living as a women I still don't understand why girls want to be with  men, who are stronger than them, have a more privileged placed in  society and are too often potential abusers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there is talk about a first period, which I never had and never will. Tampons, pads and comfort routine during menstruation are a part  of this secret women world I'll never be a part of. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there is motherhood. I cried more than I could count because  I'll never be a mother. I don't even want kids anymore but still can't hear people talking about babies without experiencing trauma. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd finally, SRS. I had my first appointment with a doctor and I'll have it done soon. Boy, is this one is a huge can of worms. I'll need to  regularly stretch it, because my body will reject it and try to heal  over it. I'll have to carefully and frequently wash it, because it  cannot clean itself like in cis women. I'll need to always use lube during sex, because there won't be any natural lubrication like in cis women. And what hurt me the most, I'll lack muscles controlling it, so  even on the surface it won't function the same.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo matter how hard I'll try, I'll always be a worse cis women, there will be something that I lack or don't understand on emotional level. It  was devastating and drove me into a terrible depression. As an enby, it also caused suppression of my identity, so gradual that I honest to God forgot I was one. Only after therapy I remembered who I was and started to get better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut there is a good ending to this story and I hope it'll be the ending for anyone, who was in the same dark place as I was. I just stopped worrying about being cis, which I'll never be, and embraced being trans, which I always was. Cis women have their own shared experiences and  shared thoughts. We, trans women, have ours.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was trying to be accepted as one of them and even when I had that acceptance, I always felt like a stranger. I finally found peace when I realized i was one of us all along.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMtF are not worse cis women. FtM are not worse cis man. We are different and beautiful and valid.

Now, are your feelings about your gender no longer valid because you have a hormone disorder that increases androgen levels and decreases estrogen? If you didn't have it, would you feel the way you do or do you feel the way you do only because that's part of the disorder? Can a hormone imbalance essentially make someone trans?

But know i don't know when and where i should tell her. Ive been thinking about asking if we could talk sometime after school at the end of the lesson and then coming out in a private environment.

Luckily I do fall under the passable category, living in the bible belt would be much worse if not for that stroke of luck. I have an issue that I'd enjoy being able to talk about with others who truly understand though. During the beginning of my self discovery, I started going out and seeking to be viewed and treated as a woman.  Which then led me into some situations and groups that I really should have stayed away from, but alas, one of those meetups helped me realize how sick and fed up I was with presenting as male during my daily life, when I was sooo much happier being true to myself, which then prompted me to take the leap into living full time. However, due to the fact that I was taught self defense by an experienced family member I've always been able to feel safe and secure no matter what situation I put myself in, (another instance in which I have an advantage over most other transwomen) that usually resulted in me getting involved with... well, things. I ended up getting a couple of admirers who weren't too bad in bed and were decently equipped, also, there was never a shortage of party favors available to me, green, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. The only thing I do regularly is green and booze, but not to an abusive level. Anyways, being single for about 7 years now, and with low self esteem, when I hit certain low points I seek out those admirers, and unfortunately, no matter what I do I can always get their info again when I get that mood. I've deleted contacts, emails, and blocked contacts, but I always find a way to reconnect when I hit my low points and want to feel desired and accepted. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has discovered this crutch and maybe also been trapped in such a self destructive cycle. Sadly it seems to be the norm for transwomen who seek out acceptance to find it in the seediest of places. I would really appreciate having a friend to talk to in some of those times who would understand and not judge. Also, if anyone else has found themselves in a similar situation I'd be more than happy to try and help you the best I can based on my own experiences.

I got a short haircut, felt very masculine, and this is coming back. (Oh and sorry for my poor English)\n\nSome history about myself. My parents told me stories from when I was little, I refused to play with Barbies, wear dresses.. then later (6-10) I was a real tomboy, short hair, boy clothes, i lived in the countryside and played almost only with boys (and I still find it easier to befriend guys), people thought I was one and I was amused by it, but I was jealous that I couldn't do some stuff like being shirtless. I clearly remember having a dream where I had a penis and told my parents about it. (I guess I was a weird kid).\n\nBut then puberty hit, I started to dress more \"girly\" (because that's what you're supposed to do) and I hated shopping with my mom, couldn't find comfortable clothes in the girl section, I tried to be like the other girls but wasn't very good at it. I had a enormous lack of self confidence, especially with my image (I had a few difficult years where I had no friends and was constantly bullied, I was the ugly lonely kid, probably, still affect me in some ways). \nI discovered that I liked girls around 14 I guess, never was a big deal for me, felt natural.\n\nI don't remember how and when I started to know about trans stuff, but I recognized myself in some aspects, not everything though, and that's where my doubts come from.\nFor example, I have pretty big breasts and it feels better wearing a sports bra to flatten it (not as much as I'd like to though), the normal bras feels weird but I still wear it sometimes because the other hurt my back. I don't hate them, just wish they were smaller so I can bind (I'm really thinking about buying a binder). I also don't hate my genitals but I wouldn't mind not having my periods and being able to pee standing! \nConcerning hrt, I can't even imagine having a deep voice or facial hair, I don't know how I feel about that. \n\nSo it sounds like I don't really experience gender dysphoria, I'm not comfortable when people insist on how I am a girl, and so I should be like this, being called madam.. but that doesn't mean anything. I feel better with my hair short, more confident. I love wearing \"boy clothes\" with my sport bra, I would also like to try on men's underwear, but I don't know how to do it discretely.. I hate it when people (like my parents) tell me to try to be more feminine \"why don't you try makeup, I'm sure you would look great!\" \"Just for once wear a dress, I would be so happy\" that kind of thing.. but maybe I just hate everything girly because I disagree with what society wants women to be like..\nI thought about non-binaries identities, and I guess agender would fit me best, but I'm not really comfortable with the word, feels like it's missing something.\n\nSorry I guess this is the typical kind of story that you see here all the time, but maybe this could help me see things clearer, just hearing stories about people in my situation.

Last week I finally got around to putting in my name change application and I'm pretty excited about it. I didn't expect this email, however:\n\n&gt;\"During the assessment of your application, the reason you have provided for the change of name has been deemed unsatisfactory. **You are requested to provide further clarity as to the reasons for the change of name, surname** &gt;!\\[censored\\]!&lt;. Please complete a statutory declaration as to why you are requesting a change of name and any reasons behind the name you have nominated to change into.\"\n\nOn my application, where I was asked to provide a reason for my name change, I simply put that I was transgender and no longer wish to be known by my former names. I can see that this reason doesn't necessarily line up with my desire to change my last name \u2013 but as I didn't think it would be an issue I kept my answer short.\n\nThe long explanation is that I spent a long time looking at different names both first and last with only one suitable candidate that I wasn't 100% sold on, so I decided, at least for now, to stick with Dannii, which is what I've been called since starting my transition.\n\nDannii is already very close to my birth name, Daniel, and I was hesitant taking it on for that reason. I need some more distance from my old name. It makes me cringe every time I hear Dannii in conjunction with my last name. It isn't unusual for transgender people to change their surname as they make a fresh start.\n\nSurnames are essentially genderless, but other than this, I'm honestly not sure what the big deal is, or even if it's a big deal at all. Do you really need a \"good\" reason, or is it that my given reason didn't seem to match in their eyes? What if you just really didn't like your surname, would that be enough?\n\nAnyway, I REALLY don't want to get my application denied, nor can I afford to go through the process again so I thought I'd come here to see how other trans-people in Victoria went about changing their last name or if anyone knows what BDM-Victoria considers to be acceptable reasons for a change of surname.\n\nThanks for your time,\n\nDannii  \n\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nI believe I may have found a definitive answer, courtesy of Whirlpool Forums.\n\nThe answer hopefully lies in section 4.6 which basically says that there are no specific reasons they would refuse to change your surname other than suspicion of fraud or improper use. The reason they ask you to give during application is their way of identifying these improper uses.\n\nI guess only time (and some more paperwork) will tell if this is 100% the case, but I'll start by making some phone calls today to see what they say :)\n\n[Victorian Government Name Change Policy](https://www.bdm.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/embridge_cache/emshare/original/public/2017/05/b6/5102deadd/change_of_name_policy.pdf)", "date": "2018-09-04 17:48:33", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9cy024/victoria_australia_being_trans_was_deemed_an/", "author": "Dreaming-of-Dannii"}, {"title": "If I made a groupme for trans individuals would anyone be interested in joining?", "text": "", "date": "2018-09-04 20:07:17", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9cz7uh/if_i_made_a_groupme_for_trans_individuals_would/", "author": "LeftyEnby"}, {"title": "Non-binary rant", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-09-04 20:51:20", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9czlkb/nonbinary_rant/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Not sure if I'm nonbinary or FTM", "text": "I know that ultimately I'm the only one who can answer this question for myself, but I'm hoping I can at least get a little guidance on how to go about it.\n\nSo, general background, I'm 20 years old and afab. When I was ~13, I started questioning whether I might be trans. I didn't know about nonbinary people at the time so I was purely questioning whether I might be a trans man. But at the time, my mother said a lot of really transphobic stuff and it got the point where I'd shut down all my questioning out of sheer panic about what I'd have to go through if I really did identify as male.\n\nFast forward a couple years to when I'm about 15. At that point I discovered what it means to be nonbinary and found it to be a comfortable label. That's how I've identified for roughly 5 years now, but I'm starting to have my doubts.\n\nThe tricky part is that I have days when I feel more male than other days. It could just be that I'm genderfluid, of course, but there's also the possibility that I'm drifting in and out of denial. I think I might have repressed a lot of gender stuff due to fear of my mother's reaction, and sometimes it just comes to the surface. There are days (like today, which is why I'm posting this) where it feels clear as day that I'm male, but that feeling is often gone within a day or two. Naturally that makes it hard to make any kind of decisions about coming out and/or transitioning.\n\nI sometimes worry that I only identify as nonbinary because it's \"easier\" in some ways. My personal experience is that there's less pressure/reason for a nonbinary person to actually transition, come out, etc., because there's really no wrong way to be nonbinary. Not that there's a wrong way to be a trans man or trans woman either, but it definitely feels like there are fewer societal expectations for nonbinary people, even if it's only because society at large doesn't know nonbinary people exist.\n\nSo, long story short, I want to know how to go about distinguishing whether I'm nonbinary or ftm.

Not so much the dysphoria itself but lack of options I have. I alternate between freaking out about it and going about my day and night in an unreal haze. And now that I'm aware, I can't ignore it. I can't write it off or repress it or anything else to just get me through the day without thinking about it. \n\nTrouble is I'm also not in a position to do anything about it. I just lost my job, I have no real relationships with my family or (abusive) parents, aside from a few femme/androgynous things, not all of which I can wear in public, the only clothes I have are practical shapeless work clothes and my dad's old hand-me-downs, I have two crummy electric shavers that I'm not putting near my forest of body hair and the most basic makeup (literally just foundation and powder) There's almost nothing I can currently do to make myself look or even feel less masc.

But you had long hair, how did you know?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell, everyone else thought I was a girl, so they told me I should have long hair. But I\u2019ve had short hair for a long time now. Besides, I know lots of boys with long hair. Your Uncle used to have long hair!\u201d\n\n\nShe nodded at this, but still seemed kinda like she was grasping the concept. I added;\n\n\n\u201cAlso, if you cut your hair short, you would still know you\u2019re a girl, right?\u201d \n\n\nShe answered yes.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exactly like that!\u201d\n\n\nI swear I saw her eyes light up like \u201cOH!\u201d\n\n\nI love her so much, she\u2019s always been a staunch defender of my pronouns and chosen name, the first to jump to correct someone.

Nonetheless, I had always been a little paranoid about that scenario.\n\nA couple weeks after my first shot, I was talking to another trans friend. He mentioned to me that he had developed a phobia of self-injecting ever since he pinned a vein and bled all down his leg and it freaked him out. He said he knew as soon as he stuck it in and started moving the plunger down that it was very wrong because it hurt way more than normal. sure enough, vein. he's lucky he only ended up pushing a minute amount before stopping. since then he always has his boyfriend inject him in the glute.\n\nso about a month later, I was doing my shot. I jabbed in as usual but I noticed it hurt way more. I remembered what my friend had described. I pulled the plunger back and sure enough there was a bead of blood in there. I grabbed a cotton ball and held it there for a minute after withdrawing the needle + put a band-aid over the cotton ball keeping it still pressed against my skin in case the scab opened up and then re-stuck myself in a different spot (ideally should have used a fresh needle but I was running a little low on them - the new injection ended up going fine, not even bruised). if I hadn't already had my cotton balls and Band-Aids all at the ready I probably would have gotten a fair amount of blood on the floor, and if I had ignored the pain, not aspirated, and just injected anyway, who knows what would have happened (not good things)!\n\ntakeaways:\n\n1. always aspirate, every time\n3. always keep cotton balls/band-aids ready\n2. your dose should still be good to inject even after aspirating a little blood - it's your own blood, it's only a biohazard to other people, not you. just try to squeeze as much of the blood out (after withdrawing the needle again of course) before sticking yourself in a different spot so you don't leave a nasty bruise. the blood stays in a little droplet at the bottom of the syringe since the medicine is oleaginous and it's easy to separate back off.\n3. ideally use a new needle after sticking yourself because the tip actually dulls after using it once and needles are very cheap\n4. don't panic, you can just try again, you won't die or even seriously injure yourself as long as you aspirate every time and don't be hasty.", "date": "2018-09-14 08:34:33", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9fqapd/psa_for_selfinjection_always_aspirate_your_syringe/", "author": "sudo999"}, {"title": "Medical document translation", "text": " If you need [medical document translation](https://www.usatranslate.com/services/document-translation/medical-translation-services/) services of high quality at affordable rates, get in touch.

However I hadn't shaved my face in two days, and I thus had stubble. As someone who frequently wears/wore light facial hair in adulthood this wouldn't normally bother me, dysphoria aside. I always thought i looked good with stubble, even if it wasn't very me. This night, however, in light of the recent realisation, a little voice in my head took this as evidence that I was ok with being male or at least masculine. And I tried to convince myself of that, in front of the mirror in my bathroom. That obviously didn't work, I kinda spiralled, and scratched up a bit of my face.\n\nI wish I could feel good about this whole thing. It's not being trans that makes me not want this to be my life and me, but knowing what I'm going to have to go through not only with transitioning but eventually as an out trans person. I know I've only been consciously trans for a week and so maybe I'm just catastrophising or overreacting, I know trans people in real life and I know there are so many of them here that live good lives as trans people, not without adversity of course but I know it's possible. I just can't help thinking I'm not strong enough to handle this.\n\nI guess I just want some guidance and comfort because, well, I've never self harmed before, at least not actually gone through with it (it wasn't a conscious decision to do it though, it happened more in a frenzy) And my subconscious being a devious little shit, of course I can't really wear makeup until this heals a bit more.

He's weird, and I may not like it sometimes, but he's my rock. He's always there to tell me to get off my ass when I fall down. \n\nRecently, as I came out a couple months ago, I've been attempted to present as a female.

His reasoning being he met me as \"the boy\" not \"the girl\". It's weird for him to suddenly start calling me a girl, he says, which I understand. \n\nMore alarmingly, he's said some pretty hurtful things to me. Like when I wore makeup the first time at school, he looked at me and asked, \"What's that faggot shit on your face?\". He's said similar comments about different things as well. Maybe he's joking, but it still *really* hurts. Especially coming from my best friend. I see him every day at school and at work, and I don't know what to do, because now all I can think about when I see him is how he'll probably think I'm a freak when I transition. \nAnd what happens when I finally look and sound like a *girl*, but he refers to me as a *boy*? Again, not only is that just really hurtful to me and it makes me dysphoric, but it could also put me in *real* danger, outing me like that (I'm not joking. I live in the deep South for fucks sake)\n\nI don't want to come off as a pushover, or a \"feminazi\", as he calls it.

Just a forewarning, I suck at TLDRs so if this ends up becoming a long thread I apologize, but I appreciate it if you take your time reading this.\n\nOnly just a few months ago, I came to the conclusion that I am bi. I am AMAB 21. It was difficult to accept even though I never have had any dislike towards the LGBT community. Since then I had questioned my gender. Was I really a man? Were there any signs I might have missed out on? These thoughts had me confused for quite some time as I was trying to figure things out. Even now, after saying to myself I am NB, do I still feel cognitive dissonance about it.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest, I took those \u201cwhat gender am I\u201d quizzes to see if that would help. Whether I did it to confirm my own feelings, I cannot say for certain. The answer I got felt - right. And yet I can\u2019t shake the notion I might be lying to myself. I currently identify as Androgyne, the halfway/mix between man and woman, including the mix of masculinity and femininity.\n\nTo put it into perspective, I can give you some examples from when I was younger that one might say made me an \u201cegg\u201d. I had to be around 4 or so. I was with my mom and we were playing together doing whatever parents do with their 4 year olds. According to my mom, as I don\u2019t remember this happening, she told me (when I was older) that I had told her I was a girl and I was going to wear makeup. She told me I was saying it to her as a joke. Tbh, idrk. I don\u2019t remember saying that, but if it\u2019s true that I did, what merit does that hold?\n\nAnother time, when I was a teen (early teen years), I was at my cousins house. We were hanging out and I remember saying out loud, though idr why, but I think it had to have been in context of something we were talking about, \u201cI wonder what it would be like to be a girl.\u201d My mom was in the living room with us when I said that and she gave me a weird look and said \u201cthat\u2019s weird.\u201d At the time it was just a passing thought, I never read into it. I didn\u2019t even know at that age being trans was even a thing. Maybe that had something to do with it?\n\nOne small part of my earlier years I also have a distinct memory of for some reason may too lay some claim. I had said to myself, \u201cif I were a girl, I\u2019d definitely be either bi or a lesbian.\u201d Once again, I never read into that at all. Another passing thought at the time which I now look back to as evidence.\n\nI\u2019ve never felt much dysphoria. At least I don\u2019t think I have. I\u2019ve never been particularly fond of my body. Perhaps contempt. I knew I wanted it to be different, to be better, more muscular at the very least. But that\u2019s just because I knew guys are perceived as more attractive when they\u2019re muscular and I never was very good at talking to girls, much less having any prospects in the dating scene in general. So I thought being more fit would up my chances. But I digress.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about it since being more accustomed to thinking I\u2019m NB. The idea of having a feminine/female body is somewhat enticing. I\u2019ve also liked the idea of having a vagina, but I very much enjoy my dick and wouldn\u2019t want to get rid of it. The thought of having both sounds like a cool middle ground id be down for. Ive also really liked he thought of having boobs, and getting rid of my body hair. Even before I thought I might be NB, I thought about being the girl I was having sex with while masturbating.\n\nI can look at a female video game character and be a bit envious that I can\u2019t have their body and some of their clothes. But then I\u2019ll see some guys clothes and think those are pretty dope as well. Lately I\u2019ve noticed that I\u2019m having a pull to play girl characters in video games, and I don\u2019t know why. I can play guy characters without a problem, but I am for some reason feeling more interested in playing as a girl.\n\nI\u2019ve tried wearing female clothes (my gfs). Since she\u2019s smaller than me they don\u2019t fit well, but it felt good to wear them. Almost euphoric perhaps, but not quite. I\u2019m not crazy about wearing makeup. I did it before when I was in drama club in high school for a play I did. It was alright for the most part, except for the mascara. I don\u2019t like anything going near my eyes. It was a bitch to take it all off though, so not very fond of it. Again, not sure what merit this holds. Maybe I\u2019m just grasping at straws.\n\nThe past few days I\u2019ve looked at myself in the mirror and felt contempt. The yearn for a more womanly body isn\u2019t pervasive in my mind. Will it stay that way or not? I do not know. If you have any questions about anything specific u might want to know to help you with thinking about this, feel free to do so. I\u2019ll do my best to answer. Again, I appreciate your responses. This is an odd point in my life that I never saw coming, so your support means a lot to me.

They came to be the other day stating they believed they were trans. Prior to this they used the term nonbianary. I am kind of at a loss as to where to go from here. As a memeber of the lgbt community myself (bisexual) I know what a big deal support can be so when they started wanting to wear clothing of the opposite gender I was very welcoming and had many conversations with them over how I would love them no matter what etc. \nThe issues i am having are. \nA. They never had any kind of gender issues or concerns until the last year or so and even then it went from 0 to 100. So I concerned this may not be a permanent thing. I personally knew people who felt this way and as they got older grew out of it. I don't want to push for anything that could harm them via hormones and stuff if this may change but I also dont want to cause any mental anguish for them while they start going through puberty and growing in places they are not comfortable.  Depression runs in the family on both sides unfortunately so suicidal thoughts whether now or in the future are a very big concern for me. \nB. They already see a therapist due to issues with my exhusband. Is there really a difference between this person and one that \"specializes\" in trans issues? Most that I have found in my area don't strickly work with people who deal with this so I dont know if I should try to find them someone else when they are so comfortable with this person already.  \nC. I dont know how to start the conversation with them on if they want to change their name or anything. The only thing that really came out of that convo was they are worried about their sports and friends and I told them to wait till we get things figured out before they worry about that. That may have been the wrong advice but they have serious anxiety issues so I needed to give them something to put that concern on hold for a minute. \n\nIm just a little lost here on what to do for them and how to go about everything. \nI could use a little advice if possible or even stories of how you had things go, wish they would have went, or from other parents on how they did it.

He's never had a relationship and is extremely pessimistic about himself and any chance he has of one, or even hooking up.\nIn the past I've tried numerous interventions and pep talks, but have by now decided best I can do is be there for him. I suggested he should seek professional help a few times, but he's *very* reluctant.\n\nOver the years he's occasionally brought up wearing make up, or putting on women's clothes, for me or for him. He's also suggested we use female pronouns. I never connected these \"dots\". Finally, he's made comments in the past that I thought were borderline trans-phobic, which would result in a big fight.\n\nWe had such a fight two weeks ago. We made up the next day, and he apologized for being insensitive. But something changed. Since then, he brought up me referring to him using female pronouns a few times. Each time I said I had no problem with it, if he wanted to. Finally, he decided we'll have a \"weekend\" in which I will refer to him as female (our language is gender heavy, unfortunately).\nHis reaction was incredible. He was over-joyous, he sent dozens of happy and excited emojis, he kept correcting me every time I forgot, or pointing out that I had not corrected him when he \"slipped\". He wondered aloud (via text, this is all via texting) how it would be if I referred to him using a female pronoun in a voice message. I immediately did that, and he replied with more smileys and wrote \"king\" (which is slang for me doing a great thing).\n\nThis happened last week. Since then he's backed off slightly. When I occasionally resumed referring to him as female he picked it up. But each time he \"noted\" that I did this, like he was surprised. Each time I repeated my encouragement that it was \"absolutely fine\" for me. He insists that he's a man and happily so, continuing to use the female pronoun and noting his \"pleasant surprise\" or his \"blushing\" at it... When we met face to face I dropped it in once or twice, but he didn't pick it up.\n\nHe's now calling it his \"vacation hobby\" (he's on vacation). I feel like he got scared of it all.\nHe's the kind of person that would be very intimidated by sudden change, and very averse to talking to anyone else about this (I'm his only gay friend). I know our other friends would be very accepting, but he won't say anything to them.\n\nSo it's just me, and I don't really know what to do. I'm pretty convinced I've now \"connected the dots\" and that this is more than a \"temporary hobby\", though I would not dare guess what exactly it is... I also feel like this connects to his (self imposed) romantic and sexual isolation...\nCould I be wrong? do people have temporary feelings like this?\nIf not, any thoughts on how to approach this? should I encourage it? how?

For almost 50 years I just thought I was weird and permanently unhappy and tried to suppress those thoughts. Then I found the wiki definition of the term \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d, and suddenly the lights came on, illuminating many of the odd experiences and feelings I\u2019d had since childhood.\n\nFor several months I processed the concept, not sure if or how to proceed. As time went by, I became more and more certain that this was what I\u2019d been experiencing since childhood, based on googling and forums in spare moments of the day. But I come from a conservative family in a conservative state, where even being gay when I grew up would make you a target of derision. So I was afraid, and for several months couldn\u2019t summon the courage to take action. \n\nAs my awareness of the dysphoria and depression increased, I did thought experiments, \u201cwhat if...\u201d. My resolve gradually increased, and I finally decided to go to counseling to further explore the possibility.  \n\nI went to 6 one-hour counseling sessions with a \u201cgender therapist\u201d.  This was the sort of counselor who used the ridiculous technique of staring at you until you started talking, about something, anything. \n\nDuring this time, on my own, I began exploring wearing small bits of female clothing in public. Little things like a bit of jewelry, or extra long women\u2019s jeans. I was so happy when I got my first women\u2019s boots. (Somewhat gender-neutral in retrospect.) So I kind of did a little of my own RLE, just because it felt good. No, it felt awesome. But never super femme, I just started moving towards a more gender-neutral style.\n\nFinally after 6 sessions, the \u201ccounselor\u201d made an offhand comment at the end of the session that she didn\u2019t think I was a \u201cgood candidate\u201d for HRT. \n\nThat was extremely disconcerting to me. I\u2019d already felt uncomfortable talking to her, and now she made me feel like I was on trial, trying to prove I was trans. I\u2019m not the sort of person who likes for other people to tell me how to live, so I started googling. Eventually I came across the term \u201cInformed Consent\u201d. More light bulbs came on. \n\nBy this time I\u2019d sort of become invested in the knowledge that I was trans. I couldn\u2019t let it go. I was too unhappy with how my appearance was even further masculinizing as I grew older, and saw no other path forward to a happy life. But I still wasn\u2019t certain that I should start taking hormones - what would my parents think? My friends, my workplace, my spouse? Eventually I settled on the idea that I could hide the breast growth for a few weeks (ironic in hindsight), to give me a chance to figure out those pieces of the puzzle. I was still not certain that I should start HRT.\n\nSo I started calling around to IC clinics, and eventually made an appointment. On the evening before the appointment, I asked my spouse to confirm that she really for certain did not ever want to have kids with me.\n\nAt the clinic I go to, you must first speak with a free counselor for about an hour to make sure you fully understand the consequences and are mentally capable of consenting. Then a physician comes in and you talk for another hour or so, and at the end you walk away with a prescription. \n\nAs I drove back to my home town, prescription in hand, my level of excitement grew, and so did my resolve. I went into the pharmacy, and got a couple of puzzled glances when they read the prescription. But they gave me the pills and I walked back to my car in a slight rain, and simultaneous sunshine, oddly enough. I felt like I was floating. Then I just sat in the car, clenching the bottle in my hand, crying and thanking God for letting me reach that day. (If that sounds sappy - too bad, your problem.) I took a double dose sitting right there in the car, shame on me :)\n\nFrom that point on, I never had any thought of stopping HRT. I had a very mannish appearance, but the way I approached it was to very gradually change the way I dressed, keeping in pace with the changes the hormones precipitated in my appearance. \n\nI was never bold. At no point did I ever dress in a way to make me feel the slightest discomfort. The only bold leap I made was the first day I carried a purse lol. This is something that INFURIATES me about the idea of mandatory RLE - who the fuck is the arbiter of how a woman must dress!!? Utter drivel. A woman can dress any way she wants to!! A mandatory RLE requirement is ridiculous and draconian. \n\nAs I added little bits here and there, one of my friends teased me that one day I would come to work in a skirt. I said, \u201cno way, I prefer sort of a butch style\u201d.\n\nAlmost one year later to the day, I came to work in a skirt as he predicted, completely confident, not the slightest discomfort. I think I made a joking apology. He looked at me in the hall and said, \u201cyou made the right decision\u201d. I\u2019ll never forget that moment.\n\nThe reason I take hormones is not because of how it makes me look. It\u2019s because of how it makes me FEEL. As an added benefit, I get to wear the clothing I\u2019m comfortable in every day.\n\n", "date": "2018-09-24 01:05:30", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9idp2h/thoughts_about_hrt_being_trans_and_mandatory_rle/", "author": "extrinsic1999"}, {"title": "It\u2019s that simple people!", "text": "", "date": "2018-09-24 05:53:24", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9ifhht/its_that_simple_people/", "author": "nk925"}, {"title": "28.

Do I have dysphoria or am I mistaken?", "text": "(Sorry for the essay. I wrote a TLDR at the bottom.)\n\nI'm so doubtful. I can't tell if how I feel is dysphoria or not because when I think of dysphoria, it's hard not to imagine intense hate for one's parts, or the inability to shower in fear of seeing them. I started questioning this a month ago, when, while talking to a trans friend, I admitted to feeling disconnected from my body, particularly in the feminine parts.\n\n Saying this made me remember that I used to wish I had a penis growing up (standing to pee, feeling phantom limb, etc) and that I felt... inadequate as a girl. My best friend was the paragon of femininity, (She's goth, hourglass figure, ddd or f breasts, flat stomach, long black hair, beautiful cheekbones. She behaves like a lady in serious company, and like a 13 year old boy with the crudest sense of humor imaginable when with friends.) and I was so focused on being just like her. But I wasn't just like her.\n\n After a while I started hating pink, dolls, girliness, anything stereotypically girl made me very upset. I would try to avoid wearing a training bra (that is until PE forced me to undress around others. I hated it, obviously. I couldn't bear for anyone to see me) until it was drilled in my head that not wearing one is inappropriate.\n\n I remember half-hearted attempts at things like makeup and hair care, etc. I was more interested in art and video games. \n\nI was obviously forced to wear dresses a lot, and I was told I looked beautiful in them, but when I'd look in the mirror I didn't see what they meant. I saw a stranger, and it scared me. As soon as puberty hit, mirrors became this new fascination for me. I'd look in them and wonder why I didn't see myself. Sometimes it would depress me, or scare me, other times I felt empty, but it was pretty hard either way.\n\nThe mirror thing changed a lot once I was allowed to cut my hair. I was happier, I thought I finally saw myself. It was a lot more feminine than I wanted, but I was over the moon. After the initial excitement wore off, I started to slip back into self-esteem issues (I was diagnosed my a child therapist as very low self-esteem and depressed) and I began a habit of flattening my breasts in the mirror.\n\nI would have dreams of waking up with a penis, or a male body. I remember the first thing I'd do in those dreams is go and tell my best friend what happened and how happy I was about it. In hindsight, I think this is a really unusual thing for a cis \"girl\" (I really don't like calling myself that. Feels wrong now) to do.\n\nThen, most recently, I had gotten new clothes. I was only able to get one masculine button-up, but it's quickly become my favorite shirt. Most of the others, I'm beginning to realize, show off curves, and that makes me uncomfortable. Not even 3 months ago I loved shorts and long socks, now I can't bear to imagine something so feminine. Problem is, that's most of my wardrobe, so I feel like I wish I had this intense fashion shift from feminine to masculine before I bought the clothes. I can't bear to wear half of them, because I can see my chest in them.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Had depression and low self-esteem most my life. Grew up with neutral feelings on girliness, puberty made me hate it. I try to flatten my chest, have panic attacks when looking in the mirror naked, and wish I had a penis. I didn't start realizing this till last month, and now it's most of what I think about. I know I would be happier physically male, but don't want to look manly, though. I want to be physically androgynous (with facial hair though), but more masculine in style. Am I nonbinary or FTM? How can I tell?\n\n(Thank you for taking the time to at least skim this post's tldr.

Sorry to bring up the potentially sensitive topic of porn but I've been reflecting lately on how I watch exclusively gay porn, specifically twink type porn and if that relates to my gender identity and sexual identity as I identify as a(n effeminate) gay transman. I sometimes, rarely, am sexually attracted to women and occasionally look at such high quality images as the suicide girls series.   \n\n\nI've been thinking about how in gay porn the guys often look better, there's a whole genre of the slender more effeminate types of guys that I like (who from my limited understanding seem to be not as sought after in the gay community?) there's always at least two guys as a given, and generally there's more of an element of equality and intimacy that is often lacking it seems in hetero porn. But being trans there is the issue as well of gender envy and not quite feeling like I fit into the gay world or community because of my plumbing. I love watching it, but I also feel a little sadly disconnected and envious when watching it. I've seen various gay men reject trans men as potential partners for this reason as well which is discouraging. Of course every person is an individual and I'm sure there are accepting individuals out there, and I can't speak for the gay community as I have no idea what it's actually like (though I'd be interested to learn more about it.)   \n\n\nAnyway this post is all over the place and I apologize for that but are there other trans guys like me? Do you enjoy gay porn? If there happen to be any hetero cis individuals reading this, do you watch gay porn? Do you enjoy it? Why do you think you do if you do? (Trans)ladies this applies to you too of course. If you do enjoy gay porn have you ever thought about it and thought about why you like it? Maybe it's really not that unusual and I'm overthinking?

My story, and cute outfit pic in the comments", "text": "Over the past month and a half, after a lot of self reflection, a lot of research, and talking to some others on a forum I stumbled upon, I've realized that I am transgender. I was born a male, although now that I've accepted I'm transgender, a hell of a lot of stuff from my childhood and teenage years make so much more sense. For as long as I can remember, something deep inside of me always told me I was different. I couldn't really place my finger on it. It was especially prominent in elementary school and moreso throughout high school. The majority of my friends were female, I just felt like one of them and not a part of the male social group. In the gym locker rooms, oh my did I hate it. I never took showers after gym class because I didn't want to show my body to any of them, and it's not because I was insecure. I disliked the whole masculine mentality, it wasn't for me and never will be. Every video game even to this day, if I have an option to be a female, I pick it. I always have because it felt the most comfortable to me. Another random thing, when I was young, up until about age 8 or so, I'd always tuck my junk behind my legs in the shower and pretend I was a woman that way, it just felt right. Part of me hoped during puberty I'd somehow grow breasts and somehow not have male genitals too. When it comes to family relationships, I've felt more like a female than male. I feel a mother&amp;father - daughter relationship more, I feel like a female cousin to my cousins, a niece instead of nephew, etc. I'm an only child, but to the very few friends I consider family I feel like a sister, and not a brother. I always have, and I can't really explain why. I recently came out to a handful of close friends who were insanely supportive. My girlfriend also knows, she's a huge fighter for LGBTQ+ rights and doesn't mind one bit. Hell she was the one who initially helped me in my journey of self discovery. I've yet to come out to my parents and other family though, I'm dead terrified to. Something just tells me that my mother isn't going to care one bit, she always has had the mentality that if someone is happy and that's how they were meant to be, then she has no reason to judge. My father however, that's something that could go either way. Eventually I will, I just have to work up the nerve to. I eventually want to start hrt and possibly reassignment surgery in the future as well.

If so, why? (Genuinely asking here because I\u2019m trying to understand). \n\nI hope my question makes sense and again sorry for the ignorance.

I love him and I see that he loves me too, so we have a pretty awesome relationship besides some insecurities here and there.\nI am the first Trans girl he has ever dated. I\u2019m pre Op, so for him all of this has been new and different. He\u2019s been very cool about it, even did research before dating. Sexually: he\u2019s tried things for me since all of this was new and we eventually realized Anal is the only thing he\u2019s into. Which is totally fine; he\u2019ll always do things if they please me just so I can get off too even if it isn\u2019t what he\u2019s into.\nHere\u2019s where the tough part comes in.\nA while back, we took Molly and while rolling he confessed, he sometimes missed vaginal sex. At the time we had a girlfriend over. One thing led to another and we had a three way; worst decision ever. Basically almost ruined our relationship.\nWe grew from it became stronger and our relationship had been at a high since.\nFlash forward to this weekend, we went to a show with a few friends. That day we had been arguing over a few things. During the show we all took Molly, he had two. Same thing, he sat me down out of no where and let me know how he missed Vaginal sex. It came out of no where so it basically shocked and hurt me. He kept reiterating how much he loved me and that he wanted to be with me forever but it was something he couldn\u2019t help. I told him that even If I got the surgery, would it even help. He said to not get the surgery for him. He then starts explaining how Jeffree Star and his boyfriend will bring a third girl in if he messes pussy. I was a mess crying because I couldn\u2019t understand why out of nowhere he just started telling me all of this. He kept explaining that he does love me but he\u2019s not gay; he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s gay when he\u2019s with me but he just doesn\u2019t like penis. That he does find me sexually attractive not just that. That the only weird thing about dating me was that he never felt weird.\nAnyways, our friends come outside; I begin to hangout with them my boyfriend goes inside the venue. We were all about to leave and I go to try and find him and he\u2019s dancing with a girl. I\u2019m livid calmly push him to tell him we\u2019re leaving and that he can keep dancing with that girl he chases after me saying it wasn\u2019t like that and so forth.\nThat night I broke up with him because it was something I just couldn\u2019t get over, it basically brought up all my insecurities. Everything I feared about being with a Straight cis man that I wasn\u2019t woman enough.\nWe talked about it the next day and he apologized profusely mentioned how it\u2019s only when he\u2019s on molly. That I don\u2019t have to fear anything when he\u2019s sober. Which is true it\u2019s only happened while under the influence every other time we\u2019re good together. After talking about it he did confess that yes it\u2019s an urge he misses but it\u2019s not that important it\u2019s something he can\u2019t help but he loves me and he doesn\u2019t need it to be happy. Saying that we would be okay and that he knew working through this would take time.\nNow this is where I have some questions. How do we approach this.\nI know it\u2019s something he can\u2019t help just like I can\u2019t help it. He loves me and said he doesn\u2019t need vaginal sex go be happy and that he\u2019s in love with me and that he only wants to be with me. But it\u2019s the second time this has been brought up and he was only with cis women prior to me and him dating.\nHas any other couple dealt with this. I don\u2019t want him to basically sacrifice a part of him because of me.\nHow do we approach this do I give him space, should I just leave him, do I allow him to just play sexually with other women???\nHave any of you dealt with a similar situation??\n", "date": "2018-10-01 12:29:45", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9kfw54/my_boyfriend_misses_vaginal_sex/", "author": "ElsBelles"}, {"title": "Why are so many trans women stereotypically feminine?", "text": "Just to start off with that I'm a cis woman, and I'm probably not stereotypically feminine.

Frankly I think it's bullshit that men and women are tied to gendered stereotypes, as if me liking to knit or use red lipstick has something to do with me being a woman, meanwhile if I like sports it automatically renders me a less woman having a male interest. The same argument applies to men in a different way.\n\nI've noticed that a lot of trans women are embracing feminine gender expression in the most stereotypical ways possible. High heels, heavy make up, dresses, skirts as their daily attire, despite the fact that many women rarely wear these things as often as they do. Coupled with that, many transwomen always indulge in typically female hobbies that makes it look like a caricature of a woman, and not a legit representation of what women look like or like to do at their sparetime.\n\nSo my question to transwomen is, why do you enforce female stereotypes so heavily?

I want something else than this f\\*cking ugly body and feeling of alienation. But can I change it? Probably not. The best I could with this body get, is to look like a cheap drag queen... F\\*ck I hate that.  \n\nMy therapist didn't believe me when I tried to explain these things and my friends don't take me seriously. They just think I'm joking or that I'm \"only\" depressed. \n\nI just need to stop this. I want to be somebody. I want to have stable personality and identity. I don't even want to be here. And hate me if you want. I deserve it.

That would tire anyone. However I am very uneducated in this area and would like to know trans people perspectives in order to better understand and coexist.\n\nSome background: I am cis male from a small country that is quite intolerant sadly. I don't personally know any trans people, its never talked about in the media and for like 15 years of my life I didnt even fully understand its a thing (similar experience with LGBT people but I got to know some of them personally). I have never had any thoughts of changing my gender, and the only times I've crossdressed was in theater sketches, mostly for comedic effect. The only reason I am so interested in this topic is because I recently came across a youtube channel ContraPoints, which has interesting topics in general, but also touches upon transgender issues.\n\nMy questions:\n1. Do you think there are two genders, and you transition from a to b or vice versa, or there is this spectrum with you falling somewhere in the middle? \n2. Are there more men who transition into women, or more women who transition into men?\n3. How did being trans affect your sexual orientation? If you were a straight men and become a woman, are you still into women or does that change? Or are all trans people initially gay  but become straight afterwards?\n4. Are you always thinking about gender identity, sex, etc. I noticed that LGBT people I know all seem to be very tied to their orientation as part of their core identity?\n5. Is it important to you that others perceive you as your new gender in terms of appearance? If you transition into a women, do you try to be very feminine? Doesnt that just enforce gender stereotypes? I know there are trans people who take pride in having female body with facial hair, what is the term and reasoning for that?\n6. Are there any trans people who arent so focused on gender at all. For example, some cis people really take pride in the fact they are male or female. Others, like me, don't really consider their gender to be very important to their sense of self. Is it possible to live as a human that is comfortable in their own skin, WITHOUT bringing up identity politics?\n7. How do you feel about legislating gender pronouns. I understand that if someone used the wrong pronoun on you, you might feel like your choice of gender expression isnt valid, but should misgendering be considered a crime? Personally I use the pronoun I think when I see the person, so if you look like a female to me, I will say she/her. But if you said to me calmly that youd rather be called he/him, I will do so going forward.\n8. Obviously this is one of those topics where being objective is very hard because it affects you personally. One thing of criticisim I hear is that people who believe there are two genders and no switching should be allowed are using scientific facts while transfolk use feelings and 'inner truth' as their defense. Is this assumption true? Are there any famous trans people who debate without bringing up their own feelings? \n\nThank you for reading and hopefully this leads to a more coexisting society\n", "date": "2018-10-03 12:12:11", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9l0kr0/some_questions_to_trans_folk/", "author": "BaltazaurasV"}, {"title": "Today was exactly 2 months on E!", "text": "Typing this as I'm getting ready for bed, but I'm excited to have gotten to a small milestone. :)", "date": "2018-10-03 13:02:26", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9l0y5j/today_was_exactly_2_months_on_e/", "author": "feedbackismyfriend"}, {"title": "Mtf 22 passable", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-10-03 15:09:52", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9l20i4/mtf_22_passable/", "author": "Publicplaced"}, {"title": "i don't know I'm trans or not anymore after i set up my first appointment with a therapist", "text": "Im MtF i think and well i never really felt too much dysphoria which already makes me feel like I'm not even trans in general but, ever since i set up an appointment with them, i don't feel really anything and it's starting to scare me because i need to have dysphoria to actually know if I'm trans or not since i need alot of reassurance and I'm scared that because of this, they'll tell me in the future that I'm probably not at all. it's almost like it's just dissapeared and it's making me worry alot, can anyone help me with this? is this even normal??", "date": "2018-10-03 15:25:06", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9l25bu/i_dont_know_im_trans_or_not_anymore_after_i_set/", "author": "VaporRei"}, {"title": "What life is like for a transman in rural Malaysia", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-03 15:40:07", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9l2a94/what_life_is_like_for_a_transman_in_rural_malaysia/", "author": "R_AGE"}, {"title": "My Genderation are celebrating trans bodies, no matter what they look like.

I remember lounging on the couch and thinking I should change my position because only girls sit like that (I don't remember any specifics beyond that). I was around 8 years old. By 10, I was overwhelmed by and ashamed of my interest in feminine things. In my mind, indulging in those interests would make me a fag which was something I was taught to fear even though my mother was ok with lesbians. One specific comment she made around then stands out in my recollection, \"See those two right there? Stay away from them, they'll turn you into a faggot.\" A guy and his crossdressing partner (probably trans, but it was the 90's in rural Iowa).\n\nI was 11-12 the first time I wished I could be a girl, \"Starlight, Star bright...\" Yeah. It was within a year after that that I started sneaking my sister's clothes to wear when I was home alone so I could see what it felt like to be a girl. At 15, I started using sexuality to feel feminine (thanks to all the pedos of Yahoo! Chat! Lol). That continued for the next 11 years. \n\nDuring that time, my sexual behavior could be called self-harm. When I finally started being with girls irl, I couldn't orgasm. So naturally, I thought I was gay and started trying guys. I didn't enjoy the sex as much as with women except for 1 thing: men loved feminizing me and it was better than in the chatrooms. I was a huge slut, and I'm damn lucky I never caught anything worse than a yeast infection.\n\nAfter I finally learned to have my own orgasm at 26 (no joke) but actually found my interest in sex decreasing, I despaired for a little bit. What was wrong with me that I didn't enjoy the best feeling I'd ever had? I couldn't help but wonder. I began having sex less and less because it started making me miserable. FINALLY, I came to a realization after a somewhat dark sexual encounter: I hate penetrating. More than that, I hate my penis and the urge to penetrate with it. I hate my testicles and their need to ejaculate. I cried and wished I could be free of all that. \n\nSo came an increase in how often I wished to be a woman, and I was even crazy enough to work out how exactly to word a wish to a genie to make it happen how I want it to happen if I ever met one. Then, I started looking at sissy porn. A sort of revisit to my feminization via sexuality. I found myself wishing I could even be one of the sissies in the porn, they might not have a woman's body but they at least had a hope of passing unlike me. If they wanted to transition, they could at least look like a woman. That's when it hit me: I want to transition, but I'm afraid to look like a she-he freak (no offense intended, just explaining the process). Who would ever possibly want to date a woman who was obviously trans? But wait... I've been single for 10 years. Who am I holding out for? Why not just do something to reduce my misery in being alive even a little? So what if I won't ever be a supermodel, it's not like I'm magazine worthy now. And so finally on my 31st birthday, I admitted to myself that I wanted hrt. The genie exists, I had just been too cowardly to make the wish. So I called Planned Parenthood and made the appointment.\n\nI don't think I would have been so rampantly sexual if I hadn't suppressed so hard. I wouldn't now cringe from being touched by people. I wouldn't have had arguments with women I was trying to date because my lack of orgasm made them insecure. I wouldn't have experienced post-penetration rape.

It was a time of transitioning from a pre-teen to an actual teen. Many of my classmates started dating girls and of course, i was kinda jealous, being an introvert and not even being able to look a girl i didn't know in the eyes.\n\nThen a strange thought struck me: \"You know how much easier dating would probably be if you'd be a women yourself?\"\n\nIt was a silly and stupid early teen thought, but it stuck with me. First I surpressed this, \"its just a stupid thought, stop thinking about it\" but then I started to wonder.... What if I was born intersex but my female attributes were removed shortly after my birth, another Trademark stupid idea, but whatever.\n\nI then increasingly wished I'd be female, I liked the idea more and more. I got into a few fetishes, like gender bending because of it. I'd imagine myself as a girl and how happy I'd be as one.\n\nFirst i didn't know anything about Transgenders(no offense intended) , but then as I researched a bit, I learned more and more.\n\nThere was just one problem. My family.\n\n\nMy family is kind of the old Matriarchal organized one, with my grandmother being the center of it. The entire family is very close to each other, we celebrate every major thing together, 30 people all at once.\nThey're all ultraconservative, traditional minded people, most of them farmers.\n\n\nHow could I ever come out to such people? How could I possibly sit next to one of my female cousins and act and look like a girl.\n\nSo I buried this somewhere deep in my mind, said to myself, that it was just some stupid teenage phase, nothing to be concerned about.\n\n\n\nBut then, this year I remembered this, learned more and more. I started to actively questioning my Sexuality and my preferences. Was I really straight, or maybe even bisexual?\n\nI found this subreddit and it comforted me. I started to accept that I might be trans, and It gave me literally mental strength and confidence.\n\nThe last weeks I felt a kind of euphoria at this discovery, that I had never felt before. \n\n\nBut I started to question it again.... \n\n\n\nAm i really trans...? Do I just like to think of myself as a trans? What if Its really just a phase, or maybe I just liked the idea so much i lied to myself?\n\n\n\nWhenever I walk in front of a mirror, I Feel that who I see isn't me, but a stranger. I felt this my entire life.\nI hate the whole \"manly manliness\" masculinity. I never liked watching sports, or rambling about women, or even build things with hammer and nails or something like that.\nI was always kinda feminine, cried about everything till age 12.\n\nBut I never had any real disphoria, I never hated my penis, I was proud of my facial hair. And i certainly never had depressions because of this.\n\n\n\nIm confused and scared. Am i really transgender or am i just one of these trendy teens, that want to be special?\n\nI need help. Before I start anything, i just need help.\n\n\n\nCan any of you give me advice? \n\n\n\n\nPlease excuse my gigantic text wall and my incoherent rambling.

I just have to tell you all so I can have an entrance into the community and give you some insight on a struggle of one of your peers. Hopefully this can help inspire anyone else who is going through a similar struggle. \n\nSo I\u2019m 27 mtf. I\u2019ve always known I\u2019m bisexual. It took many years to accept that fact. So I\u2019ve been open about it since. I\u2019ve always had a feminine take on life, but I brushed it off as just a quirky trait. Everyone in my life knew about my attraction to men before I even did. I eventually embraced it over time as my peers became more and more accepting with age (I lived in an area that has come a long way)\n\nBut what really crushed my soul was when I volunteered to teach in a small country in rural west Africa. In this country (or most all really) in Africa, homosexuality is a crime and mob \u201cjustice\u201d can range from a savage beating to death on sight. \n\nI thought that it won\u2019t be a problem. I\u2019ll be \u201cstraight\u201d heck there were multiple other gay and bisexual volunteers who worked by my side. In a place like this, you just don\u2019t tell anyone you\u2019re gay, and you\u2019re fine. \n\nTo spare you a lot of details, I grew increasingly angry and frustrated with the world. I began to hate the same people I\u2019m supposed to help. Then I had a fucking meltdown when I witnessed first hand a young girl get savagely beat for talking back to mom. This was in broad daylight in the center of town with foot traffic. No one even looked to see what was going on. The helplessness you feel when you must watch this but can\u2019t intervene (last thing you do is intervene in a place like this or you\u2019ll become the next victim). It was then I knew I was truly in a dangerous place. \n\nLater another volunteer told me with great grief that a local boy in his village disappeared after he came onto another boy and the other boy told the chief that he tried to rape him in the bush. \n\nI fell into a spiral of depression and alcohol abuse. But why was I the only one feeling this strongly about it? I started lashing out at my fellow volunteers and performing worse and worse at school. The anxiety just grew and grew and the alcohol got stronger and stronger. \n\nThen one day I just snapped. I lost all my empathy and emotions. All I felt were the raging head aches and heart palpitations. I knew I needed to leave this place forever and never look back. And so I did (against my will actually) my program forcibly deported me from the country because I was no longer able to make decisions on my own and the alcohol would have killed me eventually. I spent 18 months like this. \n\nThankfully my program listed me as a medical discharge and not a flagrant mark on my passport. (I\u2019ve done a lot of traveling over the years including wonderful homosexual excursions in Paris) \n\nSo my parents took me back in unconditionally. I refused medical attention (bad; but it would end my international career) and worked on figuring things out on my own (also bad). \n\nSo I decided to just keep pushing forward with a fake smile on an empty shell. I did cut back on the drinking but I was still miserable. I lost that spark to be anything that I once was. \n\nI ended up getting a good, decent pay position in an Asian primary school. So here I am in Asia. It\u2019s great it really is. For the past month and a half I\u2019ve gone through the motions. Do the paper work make connections establish yourself. It was good/great in fact but I was emotionally not all there. \n\nMy colleagues ... I\u2019m just going to copy and paste the rest from a text message of a good friend : \n\nWell what really set the ball in motion was that all my colleagues are women. Like 95 out of 100 teachers are women. And the English office has a number of desk occupied by women. So I\u2019m constantly surrounded by women. I\u2019m loving it. I love looking at them, talking to them. Chinese women are the cutest people. The way they act and talk is just so adorable. And it\u2019s never sexual. I mean I do fantasize of them a bit of course to appease my bisexuality. But when it comes down to it, i feel like I belong here and started thinking of ways to start acting as cute and adorable as they are. And I was like god dam it! I want to be cute too. It\u2019s cute too that I have my long hair. Some of the younger teachers started playing with their hair citing mine as inspiration to brade theirs or whatever. \n\nAnd \n\nWell up until now, I always thought that I was just bisexual and like feminine stuff. The constant trans porn and fantasizing that I was the women never tipped me off. \n\non Tuesday I got lunch with another foreign teacher. She is 43 (absolutely stunningly beautiful by the way) and we connected on being spiritual and looking past material things. Then we past this guy who was dressed very strangely (I seriously have no idea what he was going for). That prompted my friend to say \u201cwhat do you think it\u2019s like to be gay in a place like this?\u201d Then I started with \u201cwell first of all I\u2019m bi. So in [insert country]... blah blah blah... and I just want someone to call me pretty and wear makeup and wear a dress and I don\u2019t care who sees. I want to do it like those trans girls. ... holy shit\u201d\n\nSo it was right there like the flip of a switch. That realization literally change my life 180 degrees. I was just in awe for the next two days as I re evaluated the past 3 years of my life in misery. \n\nI came to terms with who I am and life makes all the sense now. That African country was so oppressive and so violent towards homosexuals that it put me in a fatal panic. \n\nThis was last week and I\u2019ve already quit drinking and the quality of my work and social life has already shown quantifiable improvements. \n\nI\u2019m so happy y\u2019all. I\u2019m just so happy. \n\nEdit. I imagine why I fell so hard was knee deep down that I could truly not repress myself because you can be gay behind closed doors as my fellow volunteers did, but you couldn\u2019t be trans. Period. There would be no way to hide it.

I'll get it by the end of this gig...I hope. \n\nI bet you feel awkward. You were being kinda awkward. The most awkward moment was when you were surprised when I called my ex \"he.\" Yes, he. A straight cis gendered he. But I'm not writing this to berate you for being awkward. \n\nI'm writing this to thank you. \n\nThank you for double checking if my name was Andrea* or Andrew* and not batting an eye when I said people call me both. I don't know how you realized I was trans. Maybe it was when I used the \"family\" bathroom during the break. Maybe it's my hair. Or my pants. Whatever it was, you didn't know, but you noticed. \n\nThank you for joking all day. A lot of your jokes were offensive, and I didn't like some of them, but you did make the day go a lot faster. \n\nThank you for making it so that I outed myself to anyone who could hear me. I'm not really out at work because it would be a lot of explaining to a lot of people I rarely see. But you were trying to backpedal after being awkward about my ex by making a joke about Mrs Doubtfire and pronouns. Because of the banter, I felt comfortable saying that \"I'm a they\" in front of the whole crew.\n\nMost of all, thank you for giving me shit about my pronouns. Why would I thank you for that? Well, because you used them. You didn't tell me I was weird. Or that they/them pronouns didn't make sense. You were picking on everyone all day to make people laugh. So when you said something to the effect of, \"whatever you say, *they*\" it made me laugh. You were giving me hell the same way you had been doing all day, but you were also acknowledging me and the fact that I had told you something important. (Plus, it was impressive that you seemed to process that new information so seamlessly.)\n\nI hope you don't think you offended me. I hope that we get to talk gender again tomorrow, and that I can reassure you that you made me feel better and more comfortable being myself. I know you're not exactly PC and that you don't get all the complexities of being queer or trans or gay. But I also know that you are open, accepting, and curious in a way that means you're willing to learn. \n\nSo thanks dude.

I had already messed up alot of my life trying to ignore who I was and act like I could get by as male. By the time I was ready to come out, I was 33, tattooed all over, had a history or substance abuse, a record, and no living parents/grandparents. The choice was easy: What have I got to lose? I burned my manclothes, and immediately started presenting female full-time before I even made any appointments for HRT. I plunged right in. The one person I have that can be considered family was my fiance, and she was THANKFULLY, onboard.\n\nI wish that we could all just make the plunge so completely and quickly. But that is unrealistic. I realize that by not having living family, I didn't have to worry about them. I was Free to be myself, no strings attatched. The story I hear more often or not has to do with young adults who's familys force them into guilt trips, wont let them live with them and take HRT while they're in college, and many other things that are unreasonable. Sure, some cities in America and other countries havea shelters for youth, or special trangendered programs for those of us booted from home and job after outing ourselves. However, most towns and many cities don't have these programs. Our brothers and sisters out themselves, hoping against all hope for support, only to be taunted, ridiculed, and ostracized by the ones who were supposed to love them unconditionally. These loved ones force them into a corner where the subconscious mind develops unhleathy habits, defense mechanisms, and fears - a terrible foundation for a young adult. Eventually they may be able to get out of that situation, but many times so much damage has been done, and they are thrust into an unforgiving world as a transgendered human with no true family, and the poor foundation that the family destroyed while trying to make it into something it was not. These young people should not feel as if they are imprisoned within their dysphoria. They shouldn't feel afraid to explore who they are. They should be able and allowed to feel FREEDOM.\n\nThis can be an unforgiving world. I ran from my family, and from myself for many years from the age of 15 into my adulthood.

I'm a 30 something trans woman and I'd like to talk about being a man. Because even though a lot of people want me to identify as one, its tough when I've personally identified as female for so long, not that anyone knew that until I came out a few years ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut first, let me say this: I have been a VERY lucky transitioner. My friends and family are loving and supportive. My work is professional and accommodating. And perhaps most relevant to this conversation, I get absolutely no push back from anyone for presenting myself as I do. There are many who'd say I'm fooling myself, especially trans detractors, but as much as my insecurity would love it, I've never been mispronouned or stared at, and nurses regularly remind me that I'm still due for that pap smear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLike I said: I've been very lucky.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut lets take the almost universally positive experience that's been my transition and turn it on its head: let's take the trans exclusionary radical feminists at their word for a moment and see where that leads us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I'm a man.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut unlike most men, I'm a man who burned off his facial hair and then took female hormones to reshape his face and body so that he would outwardly match the appearance of a woman. I've also trained my voice so that I can sound like a real woman, but essentially, my natural voice and biology are 100% male. A father, not a mother, a boyfriend, not a girlfriend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe, him, his.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhich means that my transition was a mistake. Whoops. No more hormones, no more voice nonsense, no more calling myself a woman. Presumably, I should also correct people who get my male pronouns wrong... after all, I'm pretty sure anti-trans folks don't want me to stop behaving and dressing the way that I'm most comfortable, which will undoubtedly lead to some misgendering. I mean... I like long hair and dresses, and I behave the way I behave. You can't fault me for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what does this more truthful life look like? I'm sure that seems besides the point to its proponents, but seeing as how I'm fundamentally altering my life to fit your premise, at least give me a moment to talk about what my life is like now as a very feminine man. Doesn't seem like that much to ask.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, most of the time, its just really uncomfortable.\n\nReally, really, uncomfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd scary.\n\nVery, very scary.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPutting aside how I feel about my body for a bit, people are either polite and treat me like an outrageously flamboyant man, or they're not polite and they treat me like a perverted man wearing his sexual fetish around in public. Which is odd... because I haven't changed my daily behavior or my routine in the morning. I'm still generally sweet and friendly to everyone I meet. I wear the same neutral shade of blush and keep my hair in the same thick, shoulder length waves. Why should being a man change that? It's honestly a pretty conservative look.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd yet, no more friendly smiles and casual chats with moms when I pick up my daughter from kindergarten. No more kind banter with the older gentleman at the local coffee shop, no genuine warmth when I tell the barista I like her hair. Faces fall when I'm introduced as dad to the parents of my daughter's new friend. Even the kindest people fall silent and awkward when I assure them that, yes, I'm just a regular guy, so please don't call me \"her\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAwkwardness. Tension. Staring. Thinly veiled hostility as I refresh my nude lipstick in the men's room before using the urinal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut, of course, we know why. Those who meet me have no idea what to do with me, the social cues are all missing and in their place is discomfort or anger. Filtered through the prism of what they think a man is, I become so skewed as to no longer be visible, comprehensible. I am just a mystery. A threat. An anomaly flying hard into the face of gender roles so deeply rooted in our psyche that psychologists say we imprint on them as young children. It's an association so strong that people kill themselves when that gender imprint and their external biology don't line up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. Maybe I can deal with the hair, the genitals... this man's body. This is the cost of living my life truthfully. And besides, as any radical feminist knows, this terrible miscommunication and discomfort is really all on our society and its deeply seated issues with gender. I'm doing everything I can for now and this torturous, dangerous, strained existence is worth it because, decades from now, maybe people will finally stop falsely conflating being biologically male with masculinity.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThat's what you want, right? For me to face this reality?\n\nNo, not want... *demand*.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo how about not. How about I choose how I want to accommodate this intellectually lazy, xenophobic, heavily gendered culture of ours. Because I do have to accommodate it, and that means choosing between being seen for my chromosomes or being seen for myself. And I choose to be seen for myself. My personality. My thoughts and my fucking feelings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf society can only comprehend me as I am if I present myself as a woman, then I will be a woman. I refuse to let anyone else's interpretation of my biology get in the way of being seen and being heard.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...does that last bit resonate, trans exclusionary radical feminists? Does it sound familiar?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAh, well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-10-11 21:53:51", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9nec8u/lets_talk_about_being_a_man_stuck_in_a_mans_body/", "author": "ohsohesterical"}, {"title": "Happy coming out day!", "text": "Hello my name is Clara I'm transgender and bisexual and I just want to say you're all valid and loved and I'm proud of you all for being you and being brave to be yourself!\n\nThat's it\nThank you for coming to my TedTalk", "date": "2018-10-12 00:58:17", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9nfrg4/happy_coming_out_day/", "author": "claroo_mtf"}, {"title": "I'm not sure if I'm ever going to come out to everyone.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-12 05:12:16", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9nhhew/im_not_sure_if_im_ever_going_to_come_out_to/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "MtF Sex drive and Orgasm pain on Cypro vs Spiractin", "text": "Due to a higher T count than I should have had, my doctor recently changed me over to Cypro from Spiractin.\n\nSince the switch I've had a massive decrease in sex drive and whenever I actually get aroused enough to do anything about it my orgasm is kind of almost painful.\n\nMy earlier T-counts had been fine, but on the Spiractin, while my sex drive went through a period of death, after a few months it came back to a really nice place - definitely better than before. It was there and could be strong, but also totally manageable and controllable.\n\nThis was the first instance of my T count being too high - but it was kind of alarming, with my levels being 20 compared to my pre-HRT levels of 29. I was happy to swap over as I was hoping that maybe this was the reason why my arms, which are still very shapely, had failed to lose much muscle.\n\nCurrently I don't have a boyfriend so this isn't really an issue at the moment, per se, it's more just something I want to keep up because of the old adage about sex drive - that if you don't use it you lose it. I'm also really worried that when I finally do ge a BF I won't have any sex drive at all or be able to orgasm without pain.

He said he didn't have any desire to be a woman, he just liked wearing women's clothes. He loved the feminine aspect of it. Over the past month or two, he's moved towards wearing women's clothes exclusively at home and has expressed interest in doing so outside of the house, but we don't live in a super liberal area so he's afraid to. Also very afraid of our families reactions, etc.\n\nHe hasn't expressed any need to go by she/her pronouns, so use he/him is still okay. He's confused, I'm confused, neither of us knows what's going to happen. He said he doesn't know if he's trans, only very very recently has he started to feel like its more than just the clothes. He said he feels more comfortable in women's clothing, and that the idea of wearing men's clothes stresses him out. I do suspect he's had these feelings for a lot longer but didn't want to express them to me.\n\nI'm terrified that I'm doing everything wrong here, that I'm making it worse. I don't want to make this about me but I'm so scared that I won't be attracted to him. I already miss his beard, his cologne... I'm a straight woman but I've been known to make out with girls when drinking (what woman hasn't I guess), and I'm desperately hoping this means I'll be able to discover I'm actually bisexual or something.\n\nAnyway, does anyone have advice on this situation? We've both agreed he needs to find a therapist to really talk through things, especially since he doesn't know if he's trans or not. I'm also worried this is just a bi-polar thing, when he first started crossing, he was absolutely obsessed with it, as bipolar tends to make you do that, but he said this feels different, as it hasn't gone away like previous obsessions have. He said he feels like an asshole because he's putting me through this but I feel like the asshole for not just being able to say, \"Ok! I find you sexy no matter what!\" It's all made worse by the fact that he has terrible depression, struggles with suicidal thoughts, has no job because his anxiety is so bad, and I'm supporting him 100%. He literally told me last night that if he does decide he's trans, he might as well just kill himself because it wouldn't be worth going through all the trouble of upsetting the families, spending money on transitioning, etc. I don't even know where to start with that one.\n\nEdit: I wanted to add that I've made it very clear to him that regardless of what he realizes, I'm going to be here for him, he's not going to get kicked out, etc. We're both okay with Open relationships so hey, who says we can't still be a couple that dates other people!", "date": "2018-10-12 14:15:04", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9nkmol/im_terrified_i_wont_find_my_partner_attractive/", "author": "FirmBroccoli"}, {"title": "Made a music video yesterday to commerate Coming Out Day and to remember several trans women killed in my state.

Not because I'm a con artist or dodgy lawyer, but because his character arc of trying to find his place in the world and be accepted I feel matches my struggles. And his trajectory of feeling increasingly overwhelmed and hopeless and bitter is how i feel I'm becoming. What do you do when you feel fucked over every time? Become a bitter bastard? Or submit to being defeated and concentrate on making the generation kick ass?   \n\n\nWhen I was 24, and very much an egg despite feeling feminine for many years, and I looked like an average male. Anyway, the medium seemed convinced I'd transition at 35 when I was living abroad, which was quite a surprise to me given that something like that wasn't even on my radar. They said that it'd be very difficult and they were worried for me. I didn't even get what they were saying at first and i didn't really take any of it in as being 35 seemed like a century away. Maybe they cold-read something in my demeanour, maybe they got lucky guessing, no idea. I was very secretive about my quick cross-dressing inklings, and it wasn't something i wanted to share. I'm a sceptical believer regarding the paranormal. i believe in it (due to three specific instances), but i also believe that 99% of the time there is a boring, mundane and very earthly reason to anything potentially paranormal.   \n\n\nAnyway, I'm 33 now, and despite battling hairloss for six years, I've finally lost the battle. It's gone from being receding to full balding in just over a year. even the thick areas have suddenly gone thin. i had stunted growth as a kid and was fairly androgynous until around two years ago, now that advantage to being feminine has also gone. I've gone past the point as to where my physicality could have assisted a decent transition.  I've just started a new job which is dull but pays well (very much a Davis and Maine situation, for those that watch Better Call Saul). There's a sabbatical option where after two years of work i can leave work for a year, this would be possible in 2020. increasingly i'm planning to save up, leave work for the year, go abroad and transition somewhere away from family and friends (probably armed with a stockpile of HRT).   \n\n\nMy point is that, weirdly, never in my life has it looked like i'd transition very shortly more than now. And it'd be when I would be....35. Maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy where I've subconsciously made everything aline to match the medium's reading, who knows. But given what they said, and what I know about the world, it does seem like a transition for me would be a real shit show in any case. So, everything up until 35 now feels like some weird prequel, where I already know the end of the story and that's some sort of difficult unhappiness being trans and nearing midlife when dreams usually decay. Not the most inspiring of potential futures to wake up to. I'd just say sod it and have kids and then be a really pushy parent so they fulfil their dreams and potential no matter what the cost to them or myself, but I think that's just as unhealthy as being selfish, not having a kid and saying that I'm not done yet trying to be who i want to be - also regarding the cost.  \n\n\nProbably TDR or a niche post, and no one watches Better Call Saul, so that reference is probably lost on people, but anyway, there we go.\n\n  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-10-14 18:28:36", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9o5273/quite_a_ride/", "author": "iamajerboa"}, {"title": "Just need to talk -Jake", "text": "   Hey, I'm a (maybe trans) kid from a liberal part of Texas.

Recently though, my friends have questioned if I was trans and I don't have a proper answer. I'm trying to figure myself out on my own but everyone is looking for answers on account of how I've been acting lately, which I understand because I stopped dressing as I use to, I shaved my head, I dropped different friends, and I've been more defensive than usual. \n\"Are you depressed again?\"\n\"Are you trans or still the same as you were?\"\n\"Are you feeling more dysphoric or do you even feel it at all?\" \n  It's frustrating because all I can tell them is that I really don't know.

We have four kids, and our 11-yo is the only girl, and a trendy one at that.  From fashion to music to just about everything, she jumps on board, and with a passion.  My wife is a therapist and I'm a scientist so I think we're both pretty open minded and have just let her do her thing.  She decided to be a vegetarian at 9, so I started cooking alternative meals for her each day.  She wanted to cut all her hair off, we made her wait a week to decide and then did it.  After that came rounds of dying it different bright colors.  Then shaving the sides bare.  \n\nAs a pretty liberal household we talk all the time about equality and supporting people.  Our hope was that, if they had any issues growing up, they'd always be able to say their parents accepted them and made them feel supported.\n\nAbout a year ago she came out as gay, and we made a big deal about it like she wanted.  She colored signs, rapidly wanted to tell everyone, and went to therapy sessions with her and her father (who is way, way conservative) so she could tell him with additional help.  (I'm her step-father.)\n\nNow, she's told us she wants to transition and be a boy.  She immediately picked a name she wanted to go by instead and was actually pretty ugly about it if anyone made a mistake and said her given name.  \"Um, I go by Lei now.\" in a super attitude way. After a week she started talking about binders and hormones.\n\nFor the first time, we've put the brakes on a bit and said she needs to spend some time with a gender therapist we found before she runs with this, and to not expect everyone to change overnight.\n\nIf she is, that's totally fine, I can make that change too.  I dove into reading articles like [this one](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/when-a-child-says-shes-trans/561749/) to gain a better understanding of it all and research articles on [PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=gender+dysphoria+children). \n\nBut there's this nagging worry that there has to be some incidents where people do this now because it's getting so much attention (and getting attention themselves.)  I've read about regret and de-transitioning, but can't find anything yet about rise of false-reporting due to a supportive environment and/or attention seeking, trendiness, whatever.\n\nI wish there was a test.  \n\nOh, questions.  How do we properly guide her journey here in a way that's supportive but also makes sure this isn't just the latest thing she wants to do?

My birth-name is Markus, but I tend to go by Sarah. I'm 15, a sophomore, and incredibly confused.\n\nWithin the last year I've been questioning myself a **lot** about whether I'm a boy or a girl, so much to the point where it has spawned countless headaches among other things. I would consider myself decently educated on the subject, but I still have a lot to learn, and introspection isn't my strong suit. As some or all of you have experienced, I've been trying to figure out whether or not I'm trans, and most recently, *how do I know?*\n\nBefore I go any further, I wanted to clarify that I know that it isn't your job to figure out who I am (As I've understandably been told by numerous people), and that you all must have seen countless posts similar to this one. I have read into quite a few myself, but I thought this would be best. Ahead of time, I wanted to thank you for reading, it's not often I get to go into much depth when it comes to this. (*P.S. this is my first time posting on Reddit, so please let me know if I have gone against any guidelines or unspoken rules.*)\n\nThis never ending internal discussion started in the early spring of 2018. Before this, I really never put any thought into anything regarding personal preference, self-growth, or anything of the sort. I've had unexplained self-esteem issues for as long as I can remember, but other than that I was set. I drifted through elementary, into middle school, starting an extreme bout of depression, stemming from the aforementioned lack of self-worth. I would sit down and watch anything having to do with gender bending, as I found it extremely interesting as a topic. This is the first time I remember questioning anything relating gender. Depression (obviously) lead to a lot of crying, and whenever this would happen, the first words out of my mother's mouth were, \"Stop crying, *boys don't cry.*\" This was my first experience with gender roles, and along with it my first question, \"**Why can't I cry? Why does it matter if I'm a boy or not?**\" Although the thought was fleeting at first, it came along with the demand whenever it was mentioned. As far as I know, I cannot recall any sort of discomfort with my assigned gender other than my mild dislike for my sex.\n\nAs I moved through middle school, puberty creeped into my life at an early 14, causing a myriad of issues. At this point, I had shelved the previous thought, along with many others, including what little self-care I practiced other than basic hygiene due to next to no self worth. When puberty eventually came, I felt an immense amount of panic, feeling alien and worried. ***Had the day come already?***\n\nI started questioning freshman year, limiting it only to a thought or two, and my interest grew exponentially. I started wearing my mom's perfume and using her shower products, something that felt so much better than the *\"Axe\"* stuff my parents seemed to think I was enthralled with. All of this newfound femininity was accompanied by a warm, loving feeling, and other than that, It's been on my mind ever since. I recently got a sports bra, (Which, even more-so, made me feel unbelievably happy and nice) which I often hide under my clothes at school and in public. That brings us to the present, leaving the one question unanswered, *am I really trans*?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for your answers!

It hasn\u2019t been a strong thing, and I have not felt gender dysphoria. Growing up I\u2019ve always been attracted to girls, and some guys, but the weird thing is, I\u2019ve always thought being a lesbian felt most right to me, even though I\u2019m a guy... \n\nAnother piece of evidence is that my girlfriend is bi, which makes me kind of uncomfortable, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s because she\u2019s bi (because I\u2019m fine with that), I think it\u2019s because it shows me what could be if I was a girl. It shows me we could both be girls in love, which feels so right, but instead I\u2019m a guy. If you get what I mean... \n\nMy attitude has pretty much been that I think I would prefer being a girl if I could just choose from birth, but that feeling is not strong enough at all to warrant a transition. I am fine with being a guy, and the amount of hassle a transition entails I don\u2019t think can be justified by the amount I want to be a girl. I know there are some people who just know and they have such bad dysphoria and for them transitioning is the way to go. For me, I don\u2019t mind being a guy, and although being a girl seems a bit better, the extent of which I want this is not enough to warrant the damage to relationships, awkwardness of having to come out and transition, hassle of hormones, risking the chance of regret, surgery, etc. that comes with transitioning.\n\nI have always been turned on by the thought of being a girl as well, so I figured maybe I\u2019m not really trans, maybe this is just a kink of mine... anyway yesterday I set out to explore my feminine side a bit. I shaved my body, I bought some cute girls underwear and girls clothes and after seeing myself like that I honesty love it. It\u2019s like opening a can of worms. In the past day, every single picture I see of a cute girl, I just want to be them. I want to be pretty, and have soft skin, and ughhhhhh\n\nAnd I almost feel sad that I won\u2019t ever be like that... this feeling just like started today after experimenting with femininity, so I\u2019m so confused.

I'm a 21 y/o trans man, and I'm currently studying abroad in a foreign country. I'm very lucky in that I was able to have my gender marker changed to M before the move, so I didn't have an issue with getting overseas. For the past two years, I've rarely been \"clocked\" by strangers, so I'm currently living stealth (not obligated to come out as trans).\n\nUnfortunately, when you hang around young-age groups that are entirely straight and cis (primarily cis men), they get up to a *lot* of offensive jokes. The derogatory comments are almost always about trans women - mainly joking about \"traps\", leading into gay jokes. Occasionally there's also the stupid \"I identify as an attack helicopter\" line, \"Did you just assume my gender?\" and other annoying ones like it. These are people that I share a residence with, so it's hard to avoid being around them. \n\nSo far I've bitten my tongue, either ignored it while others laughed or abruptly changed the subject, but it's becoming more and more unbearable. I hate to be the person that makes things uncomfortable, but hearing these comments every day is making me genuinely dysphoric. \n\nBasically, my question is: Should I come out to them so that they'll understand why the jokes bother me? I don't necessarily want to do it as a \"Gotcha!\" where the point is to make them feel bad, but more like \"I'm trans, this is making me uncomfortable, and I'm asking you to stop\".

Sorry in advance for the long post. If you've got any advice for me I'd love to hear it, because I feel like there's a pretty big storm coming for me soon.\n\nTo start, I'm Flynn. I'm an 18 year old ftm guy who lives with his parents. \nA few months ago, I came out to my mom and dad as a trans guy. My dad said he'd need therapy if I pursue transition if he wants to keep being my father. He also said that, even with therapy, he doesn't think he'll ever be able to refer to me as he, and that I'll always be a girl in his eyes.\nMy mom, probably due to her extremely conservative upbringing, had a much harsher reaction. She firmly said she wouldn't be paying for any transition and, along with saying things about how if I transition I'll always be a freak and that my late grandfather would hate and disown me, told me that I'm not allowed to transition socially or medically while I live under her roof.\nSince then, I haven't mentioned anything about gender for fear of being yelled at or even punished. She acts like everything is normal, like nothing has changed, calling me she and even frequently referring to me as 'the girl'. Knowing her, I don't know what I was expecting. I'd somehow managed to trick myself into hoping that they'd accept me, which was clearly a mistake. Looking back, I'm lucky I wasn't kicked out. We've had plenty of fights since then where my gender wasn't mentioned, but was clearly the real source of tension.\nEventually, hiding who I was got to be too much for me. Despite what my mom said, I've impulsively changed my name on my social media accounts (they don't follow me) and asked my friends to use said new name. It may have been stupid, but I don't regret it. I'm trying to keep it hidden from them, as I don't currently have the means to move out and have no idea where I'd go if I could. When my parents find out, which I'm sure they will, there's going to be hell to pay.\n\nI'm at a loss for what to do. If anybody has any advice on how to keep my social transition hidden from them, please let me know! And, failing that, if anybody has any ideas for how to deal with them finding out, that'd be great.\nThanks so much for reading all this.\n\nTl;dr: I can't not transition at this point, despite what my unsupportive parents want. If they find out, I'm at risk of losing my relationship with them entirely or, worst case scenario, being kicked out.

I will refer to this person as a female because that is how she presents - just a normal late teenage girl.

When I call for an interview there will be no acknowledgement on my part that she is anyone other than the name on the application.\n2. When I begin the interview, how should I address the issue of a female standing before me with a male's name? Would it be appropriate to start with \"Do you prefer Joe or Joseph\", or should I as a more general question like \"What name to you prefer to go by\"?\n3. Assuming she does not say anything to me about being transgender I will proceed with the interview as I would any other applicant.\n4. If she does tell me she is transgender, would it be inappropriate for me to ask any questions such as \"What is your pronoun\"? Would there be any others I should ask or avoid?\n5. Assuming the interview goes well and leads to a job offer, would it be inappropriate to as something along of the lines of \"What can I do to make sure you are comfortable working here\"? Because I would have to deal with legal documents, would it be inappropriate to ask if she will be legally changing her identity in the future?\n6. If she is working here and a customer makes a transphobic comment, would it be inappropriate for me to step in and come to her defense? My initial reaction would be to handle it the same way I would if someone was sexually or racially harassing one of my employees.\n\nI have never knowingly interacted with a transperson in the real world. I want to be sensitive, helpful, and accommodating, but I also don't want to cross any lines that would be inappropriate. Thank you in advance for answering these questions and adding any other thoughts  which might be helpful. \n\nMy company is very open and friendly to the LGBTQ community, but we have never hired a transgender person before.

I'm in my late 30s and have been an out lesbian for close to 20 years. I've always been keenly aware of the gender divide in the world, particularly in regards to its treatment of women as a lesser class of being. Growing up, I rejected a lot of stereotypically feminine things (dresses, lace, growing up to be a \"good housewife\") but thoroughly embraced others (glitter, rainbows, animals, taking down the patriarchy). I found the \"soft butch\" label to be fairly close to describing me for a while. I strongly identified with women, and still do...just a different idea of women. Fierce, powerful, take no frickin prisoners women. I would often comment on my gender though as \"I'm just me.\" This is long before public discourse included words like genderqueer and non-binary. \n\nThen times changed. Now we do have those words. I picked up the genderqueer label pretty quickly, and had a good friend that shared this with me. We were like twins in a lot of ways. It was the first time I had someone who I thought felt the same as me. He later transitioned to Male, but is still very queer and open about what it means to be male. Since I felt this shared identity, it sent me into hyper-questioning mode. We haven't been hanging as much (due to life, not his transition) so we've drifted a little and haven't had a heart to heart on gender in a while. But the \"who am I\" questions continue to plague me. \n\nI'm a naturally masculine woman...narrow hips, battling facial hair since middle school...but have DDs. I dont hate my chest, but sometimes wonder if I would like a flat chest better. Even binders don't do much, and they effin' hurt. And I've not been terribly pleased with the top surgery results I see online on bigger bodies with bigger breasts. Not exactly encouraging.  \n\nI don't care if people refer to me as he or she ...but honestly neither fits. They feels like too much work, too much constant explaining and correcting. When the others don't bother me terribly, why go through the trouble? \n\nThere's also the nagging memory of a brief time in college, before I came out as a lesbian, when I said I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body. Seriously I had met maybe one trans person at that point and was only newly recovering from a conservative upbringing...I hung out with a lot of gay men and honestly I could be described to this day as a little flamboyant. Not sure if it was a by product of my crew or just my unique spin on life. Also, memory is hazy, and I may be overstating the length or importance of this statement. It very well may have been only a couple weeks that I said this...and shortly thereafter met my first girlfriend. I am very rarely attracted to men, but if I am, they are effeminate or gender-variant in some way. I love all gender transgressors, TBH. \n\nWhich is why this is so confusing to me...outwardly I have all the love for all the genders. Inwardly, I may have some internalized transphobia (see conservative upbringing). Or, I am overthinking it all and I am just me, like I have always said. Anyway, super long post, my apologies...just curious if anyone else has had similar experiences to relate, or spots some \"tells\" in my words that I am too blind to see.\n\nLove to you all, thanks \u2764", "date": "2018-10-26 14:53:06", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9rlerc/butch_gq_or_ftm/", "author": "LSparklepants"}, {"title": "Need help finding Packer for my partner.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-10-26 17:32:57", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9rmts7/need_help_finding_packer_for_my_partner/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "How Should I Deal with My Parents..?", "text": "I'm out and have been transitioning (to the point I am socially completely transitioned for months now.) I pass as cis from Boston to Dallas and have never experienced non-show-ID-solicited transphobia. I am also older, 34 now, and am a housewife to my partner of nearly 10-years' big power management job. I'm set and have an \"easy\" transition generally. I have friends and support networks and on top of it all a partner who came out as a lesbian a bit into my own transition which is just like... that is a downright *fantasy*. Friend who are weird/less supportive just got quietly cut out while those who were genuinely happy have become even closer, since. So, in most aspects of my life my transness is either wholesale accepted or not even a known factor.\n\nWith the exception of family. And that, to some degree, really confuses me.\n\nMy parents are boomers... almost 70 now. They're a bit older than many parents now, but for reference my father had an FBI file in the 60s due to his activism. They are outwardly supportive! No super-intense standoff moments and they seem to make an effort to use my name and pronouns (and my name didn't even change, just the spelling.) Everything seems to be outwardly good... except that I can't shake the feeling that they *don't want to learn more*.\n\nI push them to accept me, and they do, but it feels as if their heels are dug in. My mother was already seeing a therapist who she explained basically told my mom that she was the most important person involved and that her feelings were valid early on when... her feelings actually *weren't* valid and were very incorrect and wrongheaded. She wanted my blessing to consider that \"her son died\" and stuff that caused me some nasty mental breakdown.\n\nWith the holidays coming up I don't know what to do. My sister (who got married right around when I finally started my transition and was mad that me getting treatment for my medical condition \"stole her thunder\") spent last Thanksgiving yelling at me for having the audacity to offer to host the next holiday. She assaulted me that night and has never even acknowledged it (she is bigger and stronger than I am, even moreso now.) Afterward she hit me and abused me all night she started sobbing and crying on the couch. My whole family was concerned about her. I sat weeping alone in another room. I think that experience made me absolute hate maleness even more than I did before. She doesn't speak to me anymore. Why she decided that after I got healthy and not at any point in the many years I was an asshole, toxic drunk I don't know.\n\nBut I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend family time with a bunch of people who still see me as a boy and who refuse to make efforts to understand who I even am. The half-measure is more damaging than an outright rejection. They just... don't seem interested in knowing any more than they already do; they seem to feel that learning more about me and my medical condition... I don't know. This isn't the mother nor the father I grew up with. I don't really recognize these people.", "date": "2018-10-26 17:36:53", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9rmuzh/how_should_i_deal_with_my_parents/", "author": "KittiesStarsnGlitter"}, {"title": "Trans Authors To Check Out!", "text": "", "date": "2018-10-26 18:03:31", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9rn3m5/trans_authors_to_check_out/", "author": "sapphicauthor"}, {"title": "So sick of the cis victimhood narrative", "text": "Mostly reacting to the gilded question on r/all and /r/tooafraidtoask, with 15k upvotes.

Im quite effeminate and Ive always wanted to try wearing womens clothes. But as time went on I kind of felt that Im just a very feminine guy. This was around the same time that I found that I was bisexual as well.\n\nIve been perfectly happy considering myself a man, but just a very feminine one. But recently as Ive started university for the first time, my questions have come back. Ive had thoughts that Id want to have a more feminine body, being more curved and stuff, and Ive been shaving my legs and facial hair for about a year now.\n\nBut then the issue of genitals came to my mind recently and this is where I get really confused. I have a penis, and Im perfectly fine with it, but when I think about having a vagina, theres part of me that also kind of wants to as well. I don't know whether I want both or what. This came to my mind when I was looking at how to make my body more feminine and saw that HRT does that, but it can also shrink your penis, and have other side effects on it. And that kind of scared me, because I like my penis how it is and wouldn't want to lose it.\n\nWhat also confuses me is whether I really *feel* like Im a \"man\" or not. Ive identified as a man since ever, but as Ive become more feminine over the last few years, Ive noticed that on many occasions, people have mistaken me for a woman. And when they do I kind of like it. Then there are times when I feel very feminine and would kind of want to be a woman, but there are other times when Im happy being a man and being masculine. I have this same issue with my sexual orientation as that also seems to fluctuate as well. Sometimes I feel attracted to women, sometimes its men, sometimes it's both, sometimes it depends on whether they are masculine or feminine. I feel this is the same with my gender identity. To put it simply, sometimes I feel like a \"man\", and sometimes I feel like a \"woman\".\n\nIm just really confused about what I am and what I want to be.

This past weekend there was a deadly anti-semitic shooting in my hometown, and in our grief some true beauty and strength has come out of our community. But so has some true ugliness. I made a heartfelt post about voting against hate, and a person I haven't spoken to in 8 years commented with some very specific bigotry about gender, despite the fact that my post had nothing to do with it. My post simply said that the hateful and radical people in our country have been emboldened and validated by our elected officials, and so its important to vote against candidates that spread hate. Here was his response:\n\n\"I'm going to have to disagree completely. Donald Trump is yes narcissistic but you have it completely wrong in terms of him. all the hatred, violence and name calling is coming from democrats, and leftists , I've watched countless videos , documentaries and news from CNN fox news MSNBC BBC sky news and alternative media on the same topics, from this you can see the bias and where the news stands politically. The hate spreading , the down right lying and negativity is not from conservatives in America , in fact it stems from the left leaning media . On the presidential candidates , on the Kim Jon uhn meeting, on the trade war , on the Russian collusion on the Iran deal, on the Kavanaugh hearings , the hate filled bias towards Trump and the republicans is frankly disgusting. Just because some one has a different view from you politically does not make them a racist, bigot sexist xenophobe etc, frankly those are shut down debate words that stop free speech which is why conservatives and republicans have had a hard time . All hard to talk about topics are sensitive and for years left don't deal with hard issues. The fact is that America is economically doing the best it's done In a long time. Lowest unemployment rate (African American and Hispanic) Leftists answer to that is it's Obama's policies going into effect or it's not true America is not doing well, u can't have it both ways. #walkaway are Americans that are waking up to what the lefts goals REALLY are and it's not by any means in the interest of the American people. Trump will win the 2020 by a landslide just as I knew Kavanaugh would win the supreme Court judge. All were false accusations against him btw. Anyway just do research and see that facts, do not care about people's feelings , facts are facts, lefties are all about SelF truth trumping factual truth like more than two genders, Ludacris to think gender or age is maluable, it's about time logic and common sense comes back\"\n\nObviously a lot of different stuff to think about there, but the part that struck me was about gender, because it was specifically ignorant and intolerant of a group of people. I wanted to target that in his response, to find out where his hate was coming from. The rest seems borderline irrelevant to me in the conversation. Curious to hear the best way that you would respond, in having dealt with ignorance and intolerance on probably a daily basis. Thanks for listening.

Help", "text": "Hello, my name is Roberto, im 15 years old and this is actually my first ever post on reddit.\n\nIdk where to start. I'd like to know if im trans, or just weird. Im very confused and nervous at the moment, about sex, about transness (?) myself and my sexuality all that good stuff. \n\nI was born as a guy and I've never felt unsatisfied with myself or my body. Im sorry if this offends trans people because i feel like I'd like to be trans for the wrong reasons. This might be kind of straight forward, anyway here goes:\n\nAbout a year ago i experimented a bit with masturbation and i had a kind of phase where i inserted dildo-like objects in my butt because i was kind of longing/drawn towards the feeling of being penetrated. I did this for a few months and then it passed because it wasnt worth the preparation (the whole shave your ass, wash it inside out, wash the toys, it was very time consuming). At that point i kind of started to question my straightness and my first thought was that i might be gay, but i wasnt attracted to guys so i was kinda confused. Anyway that phase passed and i accepted im just straight with a mild penetration fetish. I kept that mentality until a few days ago, when my gf and i were talking about her being slightly confused about her sexuality (in case you're interested she might be bi or lesbian we haven't figured it out yet but i support her wherever she finds comfort) and we moved on to mine. I told her I'd like to have the pleasures a girl has for example multiple orgasms or being turned on and getting wet or just one female orgasm, because apparently girls experience orgasms differently from guys. Guys have a very short intense experience, whereas girls (from what I've read) have longer, smoother and more emotional orgasms. I really like the idea of that. Even during sex i feel like i would feel better if i had female genitalia instead of male. Don't get me wrong i love sex and finishing i just feel like I'd be more satisfied if i were the one being penetrated.\n\nI've done some research about being trans and i kind of relate but not totally. This is what has me so confused about my sexuality. I dont (think) i feel body dysphoria, i like my body and my face. I look slightly more feminine than an average guy so i guess that might weigh into it. What I do kind of feel is a slight dissatisfaction about my penis. I feel like had it been a vagina, i would be more satisfied sexually. But then i think \"wouldnt it be weird if i had a vagina but no breasts and no feminine hormones?\" so im considering it all, and it makes me nervous and scared. I suppose i could start taking hormones but even thats an enormous step. Im in the middle of puberty so i dont know if this feeling of insecurity and dissatisfaction comes from fucked up hormones and a brain going through development, or if im actually trans, to some degree. Now about the mental thing, honestly, i wouldnt mind being a girl. It sounds awesome. I also behave kind of not-so-manly so i guess it wouldn't be that big of a change to try and be a girl for a while.\n\nI'd like to have some advice from the trans-community about the transition from HRT and how it can affect me, to dressing like a girl, haircuts, surgery, sex. Everything. Im just very confused and I'd like to hear your honest opinion about the whole thing. I'd love discussing this eith you guys and girls and hearing about your personal experiences with sexuality \n\nThanks for reading, I look forward to your responses \ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc9a\u2764\ufe0f\n", "date": "2018-11-01 13:35:36", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9t9gns/confused_about_sexuality_and_the_possibility_of/", "author": "gnzlzz"}, {"title": "Thoughts on cis allies on this sub?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-11-01 14:24:22", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9t9uuk/thoughts_on_cis_allies_on_this_sub/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Not sure if this has been posted before, its so messed up", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-01 15:10:12", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9ta9b3/not_sure_if_this_has_been_posted_before_its_so/", "author": "b0stik13"}, {"title": "Thoughts on cis allies in trans-related subs?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-01 15:11:00", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9ta9jq/thoughts_on_cis_allies_in_transrelated_subs/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Is this an appropriate sub to ask to be woke on?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-11-01 15:56:15", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9taobf/is_this_an_appropriate_sub_to_ask_to_be_woke_on/", "author": "shorttyler"}, {"title": "Thoughts on cis people in trans-related subs?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-01 16:30:03", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9tazhn/thoughts_on_cis_people_in_transrelated_subs/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "I\u2019m a MTF who gets mistaken for an FTM", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-01 16:40:54", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9tb2y7/im_a_mtf_who_gets_mistaken_for_an_ftm/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "So I\u2019m in love, with a lovely trans woman.", "text": "She\u2019s something else, she\u2019s super lovely, super attractive and just seemingly a good person.

I\u2019m not trans myself, though I did question my gender as a child and teenager. After growing up and not having to answer to anyone else about my appearance or interests, and having a daughter of my own, I realized that it was never an issue of whether or not I felt female, but everyone around me trying to define what being female was and making it a very negative thing for me. \n\nBut that\u2019s not why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m writing a series of books. The focus is on four girls, who all deal with different issues that I feel get ignored too much. Autism, anxiety, depression, suicide, self care, sexual orientation, and gender identity. I\u2019ve drawn on my own experiences and thoughts for the bulk of these issues, but I feel it would be ignorant of me to try to write the experiences of two characters in particular without doing proper research and talking to real people who have dealt with such things. One is my character on the autism spectrum, the other is my transgender character, which is why I\u2019m posting here. \n\nAlex is MTF transgender, 15, and has moved to a new town and school. The books are written so that each one is from the point of view of a different girl, so even though Alex shows up in the first chapter of the first book, her reveal as transgender to her new friends doesn\u2019t happen until the end of book three, at which point we roll into her point of view for book four. She dances, she can sew her own costumes and is really good at make up. Her parents are supportive, but they\u2019re on that fence where they want what\u2019s best for their child and they\u2019re not sure what that is. They\u2019ve always encouraged her to dress and style herself as she wants to. She can wear what she wants, cut her hair how she wants, bleach or dye her hair, even get piercings. All that that isn\u2019t permanent, though. She can change her mind. The subject of HRT and surgery? Those conversations don\u2019t go over so well. What if she does change her mind? What if something goes wrong? Can they really let a teenager make such a big decision? Alex wants to get started on HRT as soon as possible, before her body starts changing too much. She knows she doesn\u2019t have much time left. And it doesn\u2019t help things that she\u2019s developed feelings for one of her new friends. \n\nThis is just a small introduction to Alex and what she\u2019s going through. While I can imagine what it\u2019s like to be in this kind of situation, I don\u2019t KNOW and I don\u2019t want to assume things. I also want to make sure I\u2019m getting things right from the parents point of view.

Of this group there was one who caught up with me after we all parted, and who I talked with before getting on the train. \n\nHe wanted to talk to me away from the rest because he barely ever gets to talk to me (for context this is the first time all those friends have seen me in ages too- I've been barely able to afford to feed myself much less go to parties, I have reasons for being distant from my friends) and he took issue with me apparently not listening to other people's experiences enough and just talking about my experience. Which I admit is something I've struggled with my whole life- I was raised by narcissistic parents and every day I try to not be that. I'm aware of my tendency to talk about myself a lot and instinctively, and try to listen more. Which I did- my friends and I talked about what was going on in their lives first and my decision to come out was spur of the moment. \n\nBut the main reason I'm writing this is that some of the things he said relating to coming out as trans worried me. He referred to the whole 'gender thing' as a 'strange and complex world' he 'doesn't like to venture into', and kept on talking about my long term job prospects years in the future as something I should think about, and when I said that due to transitioning it's hard for me to think years ahead job and career wise because transitioning will affect what I can do there. He said that there's not just 'one straight path' and I told him that if I don't transition there isn't a future for me that I can see. He then talked about maybe being an 'advocate or spokesperson for trans issues' and it was unclear to me if he was trying to say that I should consider things other than transitioning? He also kept on saying it's good I came out and talked about communication issues with other friends. \n\nI'm not sure. I don't know if I'm being paranoid, I am prone to it- truth be told my mental state hasn't been good, and my critical thinking skills have been affected as much as I hate to admit. So help me out- should I be wary?

To the contrary I want to be as supportive as I can be.\n\nThat said, my son who is twelve casually let my wife and I know yesterday that he's been thinking a lot about what it'd be like if he were a girl.  The trouble is that even though he is 12 and should be able to start assessing and understanding these things about himself, he is also a 'young' 12 with ADHD and in being supportive attempted to ask him what about the idea appealed to him and the only thing that came up was that he thinks girls are more flexible (physically - something I was very careful not to smile over because I don't think he quite gets that such a change wouldn't in fact change his own flexibility).\n\nHe's since more openly started thinking about feminine names which his 15-year-old sister has been very helpful with, but I want to know if there are ways that I can better help him understand if this is really his path.  I know probably better than he may realize at the moment how hard of a path this may prove to be with friends, family, etc., and I worry that he'll start down it half-committed and change his mind in 6 months, but if ht does it publicly that social 'damage' is kind of done.\n\nAgain, my goal here is that I want to be helpful and supportive with my child on whatever path is taken, but pointers on helping him realize whether this path is the right one from people who've been down these roads would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!\n\nEdit: as a follow-up:\n\n1. Thank you all for the great advice. It's all been helpful and clarifying.\n\n2. It seems that (at least for now) this might have been jumping the gun. In a follow-up conversation today with my wife, he clarified that it doesn't really feel like hed rather be a girl, just that he was intrigued by the idea. But he also stated he doesn't really feel like the other boys either. Given that we've never enforced or encouraged any particular gender roles ahd he's a naturally sensitive soul, I can see how he might feel alienated. To be clear though, if he does change his tune to claim that this is a path he wants to pursuit, all of your advice will be top of mind.

I\u2019ve just never been fully happy with it. I thought that maybe if my body were just lean with some muscle I\u2019d then like it more. And to some degree that remains true. I said/did some \u201ceggy\u201d things growing up, I can see that now, but I never bothered to question my gender. I just went along with what I was told who I was (I never knew being trans was a thing until later in my life)\n\nNow with a new and fresh perspective, I have a whole new \u201cegg\u201d outlook on things. If I could flip a switch and be given a feminine body, would I do it? I would likely lean to saying yes. I\u2019d have some conditions if I were to do that however. I don\u2019t fully reject my masculine side, so in essence to have a feminine body but appear more androgynous would be ideal. As well, I\u2019d prefer to have a dick over a vagina, but I think it would be pretty cool to have a vagina. Looking at the sub r/XChangePill (NSFW) only confirms that I would take the pill to give myself a femme body.\n\nBut onto my main point. I was going through the whole creating your own femme body chart, and I was giddy the entire time I was picking out what I would like. I was absolutely fascinated and loved picking out how I would like to present in a femme body. Had I not had my egg crack before doing that, if I still thought I was cis, there\u2019s no doubt I still would have the same feelings going through the chart.\n\nLike I said, I\u2019ve never felt so much dislike for my body to give me bad dysphoria. But knowing that gender euphoria is a good measure, I would definitely say that I am transfemme. I don\u2019t fully see myself as a woman. So I\u2019m going with considering myself as NB. Specifically, I go by Transfemme Androgyne. Androgyne for those who don\u2019t know means that I identify somewhere in between a guy and a girl.

Others said \u201cshe just idolizes her brothers\u201d.\n\nAt age 5 we moved she made a new friend (also age 5) who had recently socially transitioned FTM with a new name. She only knew her new friend had a vulva because he showed her once. So we had an age-appropriate discussion about it.\n\nThen Paloma (who had been dressing in boys clothes for about a year) began to say things like:\n\u201cWhen I get older I won\u2019t have boobs like yours.\u201d\n\u201cWhat will you have?\u201d\n\u201cSomething else\u201d\n\nRight before he turned 6 I asked him when people say \u201chim\u201d did he want me to continue correcting them. His answer: No. So we stopped.\n\nA few weeks later he asked to be called Diego. For the last 5 months he has been a boy, Diego, and enjoying it. Everyone has adjusted very well to it.\n\nNot long after this he angrily asked me:\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you know I was Diego when I was born?\u201d\n\nI apologized. What else could I do? I didn\u2019t know he was a boy.\n\n3 months ago we cut off all his hair. My husband has been supportive of everything else but this was one thing he was loathe to let go of. I finally just took him to get it cut. Diego was super happy with it.\n\nWe sifted through his nicer clothes today and he opted to: keep the clip on tie my mom bought him for the last wedding we attended (he ended up not wearing it but was in \u201cboy\u201d clothes otherwise) and even asked to keep the few dresses he still has \u201cin case we go to a wedding\u201d.\n\nThe only time he chose to wear a dress was on my bday a month ago.

Back when I was 17 I started to get feelings like I wasn't a boy and wanted to be a girl, months of research and tumblr browsing (this was 2013 after all) I felt like I was confident enough to confirm to myself and a few close friends that I was trans. One thing is that my body is pretty masculine, and a defining feature of myself was a big beard, even at this age, though I often kept my hair long.\n\nSuddenly, I end up in an LDR with one of the friends I opened up to. She and I have an okay start to our relationship but it quickly becomes toxic and manipulative, which lead to her cheating and it ending about a year later. But during this relationship, about a few months in I stopped feeling the same feelings I used to have. I figured at the time that thinking I was trans was just a phase and moved on with my life.\n\nAfter my last relationship, I ended up in another relationship, which lasted 3 years and I could copy paste the last paragraph and it'd be just as accurate to describe this one as well for the purposes of this story. But nearing the end, I was feeling slight twinges of my old feelings when I'd see really cute girls doing cosplay. This surprised me since I thought that these were feelings long since buried.\n\nCut now to about ~3 months out of that last relationship, and all of my old feelings have come back in full.

I believe this is why I don't experience dysphoria that much since my front facing side is masculine, but I feel this need and want to be female. I told her that it's hard to decide between the two since the male and female are both equally important to shaping my personality. It's just that one of those sides really wants to have a home and body it feels comfortable in, since the male side is comfortable either way.\n\nI guess the best way to describe myself is genderfluid?

As a 10 year old that was the first time I put a statement in the box of attractiveness in the corner of my mind. That was how I discovered that box. Something that soon became a warehouse of its own sitting right in the centre of my mind. I\u2019m ugly! I thought at the moment. That night I just started to see the reflection of a monster that would outshine the image I had about myself for a very long time. It felt like I started feeding it. Everyone at school started to mention how much of an ugly guy I was at the time. It hurt more cause I was taught that boys joke around harshly but men don\u2019t feel anyways. So instead of getting sad I started to feel guilty cause I felt. But regardless of anything there was a teenage girl in me who got deeply harmed by those comments. I felt so bad for her. I knew that was me but I still would talk to her and hug her by crossing my arms around my belly. It was gonna be ok I said. You\u2019re beautiful I said. I knew I couldn\u2019t bring her out and let her present herself in the hideous frame I had. Fast forwarding through my depressive teenage years, I got through gaining weight, having terrible acne,  suicide, and finally letting everyone get to know Allie. I looked at myself one day and I knew that was the time for the real me to come out. I looked in the mirror. I usually found her in the depths of the dark of my eyes. With my red eyes I looked at her and told her \u201cI can\u2019t act any longer without getting paid. Come out and make your own role\u201d. That was scary for her. I knew she would have a hard time surviving in my skin. But that\u2019s who we could be. So I moved across the planet. Started some hormones while disguised as now a more or less attractive freshly young man who became skinny, got clear skin, and got a better facial geometry after years of horrifying puberty. Then, I started getting rid of my facial hair, wore makeup a bit and people started to notice me as a feminine guy at senior years of high school .\n-You\u2019re so pretty!\n-That\u2019s... so kind... thank you!

My critical mind immediately took out the previous statements to show she\u2019s just plain blind.\n- she\u2019s just trying to be nice to the weird gay boy!\n- I don\u2019t know... anyways that was nice of her.\n-yeah but if you wanna survive don\u2019t listen to her!\nMy brain has been what I call an army dad. Harsh and cold hearted. But I understand why it\u2019s been this way.\nMakeup seemed to provide me with nicer gestures from people. After a while, I became an attractive girl. At least that\u2019s what people around me and some random ones said. So I became so self conscious of how to maintain it with more makeup and hair colour and fancy clothing. Occasional humble dressings without any makeup seemed to push me back to the dark hole of my mind I used to reside at. Trust me boys especially weren\u2019t afraid of making it clear that without my morning efforts and making myself pretty for 45 minuets I was not only plain but also nothing feminine. It seemed drastic for a few added lines and colours to my face. But that was my story without my painted beauty. Every time without it. People stared at me the way nightly stars in a desert make you feel insignificant. Ever since I\u2019ve been inorganic with my body. Put it on, blend blend blend until you blend. I got really good at it. I learned to do everything on my face in 10 minuets. But seeing how I looked in the mirror between the time that I washed my face and prepped it for my makeup  was just simply disappointing. It felt like I was lying to myself. Sometimes I would just miss lectures even. It got bad to the point that I had to stop finishing my first semester in university. Something that shocked the people around me. Everyone saying that I am beautiful without makeup and naturally feminine. Or people have it worse Allie! I know people have it much worse. But I just don\u2019t know who I am. Is the monster I see in the mirror just the visualization the factory of my mind made or am just raising the standards way high for me. I mean I surely am not Ariana Grande or Zendaya. I have somewhat broad shoulders. I am a bit chubby. Also, yes my face has masculinity in it. But to what extent am I magnifying it I don\u2019t know. It feels like I\u2019m damaged. When I rarely go out naturally I just more over analyze everything. People seem meaner, stares more obvious, and my hideous reflection more daunting. Meanwhile I haven\u2019t been misgendered for about a year. I feel like I\u2019m in a Limbo. I barely go out as a soon to be 19. I\u2019m not a jealous person at all but I feel inferior around other young girls. I think I should not exist because I don\u2019t fit and the worst is when I regret the time I brought myself out to the world. The void in my mind made me lonely but I could still watch the world from a guy\u2019s eyes. But now I can\u2019t function. It just seems not to be worth it. I know people in my past caused this mental image of myself.

For example, mammalian offspring depend on maternal lactation in their early life.** ... However, genes involved in lactation are also carried by males, who do not express this trait [2]. ... It is thus expected that the vast majority of sexually dimorphic traits are due to differential expression of genes that are present in both sexes [21]. \n\nIf literally anyone in that thread had browsed through the article, they could have had a bigger number than 1,500, too: \"... there are over 6,500 protein-coding genes with significant SDE (sex differential expression) in at least one tissue.\" Although, an observant reader might notice that the next line is: \"The most sex-differentiated tissue, with 6123 SDE (sex differentially expressed) protein-coding genes, is the breast mammary glands...\" to no one's surprise. \n\nSo, we've learned:\n\n* Women grow boobs.\n* This is responsible for about 94% of the sex-differentiation in the transcriptome (by number of genes).\n* People somehow read this as an anti-transgender argument.\n\n--- \nThe paper: https://bmcbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12915-017-0352-z\n\n(If I got anything wrong, please let me know.)", "date": "2018-11-07 16:05:59", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9v0ohy/ignorant_bigots_pick_out_completely_random/", "author": "yosh_yosh_yosh_yosh"}, {"title": "Trans people celebrate history-making law keeping protections", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-07 16:11:21", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9v0q85/trans_people_celebrate_historymaking_law_keeping/", "author": "dailydot"}, {"title": "I want to give up", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-11-07 18:00:51", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9v1otv/i_want_to_give_up/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "This is what I wrote to my family after I felt too dysphoric to catch public transport to see them.", "text": "I love you all so much, you are all very special to me.

But I can't avoid coming out to my grandma any longer. I got kicked out/stopped talking to my parents this year, too, and my being trans is a big part of that. I also just started T and I know even if I keep lying to her when I see her she's going to notice eventually.

To give a little back story, I\u2019ve been making some cascading life changes for the past few years, and I\u2019ve been doing a bit of healing. I keep finding myself in new(er) places in my mind and life. \n\nGrowing up, I remember really liking female characters in movies and cartoons, especially if they were the hero and / or pretty. Being a man (boy then), I would envision I was their male counterpart.\n\nI never fit in with most men/boys. I was usually picked on in groups of boys. I was / am pretty athletic. I am also pretty shy, though I do get nervous and ramble in group settings. For whatever reason, it\u2019s as if I was always the outcast, though due to athleticism and intelligence, I was \u2018accepted\u2019 into the group due to being useful I guess (trying to not sound conceited but explain why groups of my own gender seemed to accept me).\n\nOn the contrary, as young as 5th or 6th grade, I had very many friends of the opposite sex. I was the first boy who sat with an all girl table during lunch (if you can recall those days). I preferred the conversation. Girls would explain things to me - friendships / relationships / boy stuff / girl stuff. I didn\u2019t grow up in a great home. Lots of abuse and I was alone a lot. I am a proficient self learner as a result. In the neighborhood I grew up in, I would hang out with older high school aged girls. Looking back, there were definitely some \u201csigns\u201d I missed. Not saying that were looking to take advantage of a younger boy, but they\u2019d invite me over when their parents weren\u2019t home to hang out alone. I was a later bloomer when it came to puberty, so that was also a huge factor on that note. But I do feel as if I was being courted to a degree. I just thought they were really pretty and liked being around these young women and spending time with them.\n\nIn high school, my hormones raged for girls. In my twenties my bisexuality started to flourish. But in those days, my body yearned for women and their parts. I believe my early pull to having female friends at a young age helped me be successful with dating and physical relationships at that stage of life. A lot of young women at that age told me things I didn\u2019t quite grasp - I knew how to touch them. My attention to their needs, and appreciation of their bodies and intimates made me appealing. I really enjoyed their underwear and clothes they wore. Maybe not more than other boys did, but more than a few indicated that my appreciation was different in both an arousing and fulfilling way for them. I\u2019m not sure if that makes sense. I understand it now, but it\u2019s hard to communicate in text.\n\nNow I am a 30 year old man. I\u2019ve never questioned my sexuality. When my bisexuality flourished, I did have a period of time where it was new and scary, and thus I developed avoidant behaviors. I sought therapy, and that\u2019s when the \u201ccascading\u201d life changes began to happen. I became ok with liking men and women as sexual and romantic partners. I\u2019ve now been dating both, and feeling fulfilled in relationships with both. I recently just quit a toxic job and am finally feeling some things I\u2019ve never quite felt before in my life.\n\nAll my life I\u2019ve never been sure of where I fit. I never developed my own \u201cstyle\u201d of appearance like some people do. I hesitate to say most, but I definitely was/am one of those people that followed trends - not because I wanted to be trendy, but because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted so I just did what everyone else did / wore. I\u2019ve struggled with finding things about myself or that I enjoy that I can \u201ccall my own\u201d. Due to bottoming with men, and my enjoyment of that, I\u2019ve learned to embrace more \u201cfeminine\u201d things. To give an example, I was always very aroused by sexy bra and panties on my girlfriends. So once I became ok with my sexuality with men, I began to experiment with sexier cuts of underwear, but for the male anatomy. That was a huge thing for me because it gave me so much confidence in myself and I began to feel that I did something (in regards to appearance) that was \u201cfor me\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve never really fit with men (as I stated above). And I\u2019ve never had the type of infatuation with my penis that most men seem to have (varying degrees obviously). In fact, other than as a vehicle for pleasure for myself and my partner, I\u2019m really ambivalent about it, truth be told. Also due to the bottoming, I\u2019ve had the natural thoughts of - what would this feel like if I had a vagina? I feel like most people have these thoughts, so I\u2019m not trying to be romantic. \n\nAnd then something happened to me last night. A show I\u2019ve been watching, that I\u2019ve honestly been sort of \u201cmeh\u201d about as a whole, began a lesbian narrative that recaptured my attention. The scenes for the narrative were well done, and there was something about some of the sex scenes with a specific character, in the way her body was reacting (I get it\u2019s acting but it actually was not a typical Hollywood sex scene in my humble opinion) that struck a chord in me. Then, her love interest invites her to a lesbian bar where a bunch of women were dancing. As a man, I know I\u2019m not welcome in those spaces, even as a member of the community, but I felt very strongly that \u201cwow - those look like my people. I wish I was there dancing with these wonderful women.\u201d\n\nAnd right there is where I went.. wait... do I want to be a woman? Have I always? Am I just confused? I started to give myself space to just exist and not over think it, and I began to realize a lot of my nervous behaviors that sometimes make others view me as odd or make them dislike me, often stemmed from me being confused as to how a boy / man should act, so inevitably I\u2019d overcompensate. I\u2019ve always been told by my family, coaches, professors, mentors, that I\u2019m a leader and I need to step up and be a man. But last night made me wonder - is the reason I struggle so hard to do this because I don\u2019t actually identify as one? I\u2019m not trying to jump to conclusions but it was such a profound \u201cclick\u201d in my brain that I haven\u2019t been able to get it out. I do find women sexually and romantically attractive, but it was something about those characters. Their interactions, their clothing / appearance. The dancing. It just made something in my brain click into place. \n\nI\u2019ve always tried dating trans folks and haven\u2019t been successful. I find both sexes to be attractive. I tend to get ghosted. The last relationship I had was with a trans woman with whom I had a strong connection with, both emotionally and physically. We never did more than kiss and hand hold, but it was one of those very strong chemistry type kiss and hand holds that both parties sort of blush and acknowledge as less common, and thus more coveted. She ended up ghosting me. I found out later from a mutual acquaintance that she was in a relationship with a gay man and they were looking to become a throuple (is that the right word?) and I guess she had been trying to bring it up for some time, but kept chickening out. We spent weeks talking, and then weeks hanging out in public places (trans women experience violence from men so she was being cautious which I respected). Apparently the night in question when we were hanging out and hand holding / kissing, she asked a question along the lines of \u201cwould you ever do a three person relationship?\u201d - I do remember this line of conversation, and I remember actually answering in my typical nonchalant overcompensating man way \u201cno I think I\u2019m a one woman man. Or one man man.\u201d I felt the need as the \u201cman\u201d to sort of assure her. I guess I assured my way out of her life lol, but I digress. \n\nSo my TL:DR if anyone has bothered to read this - how did you know? I\u2019m definitely not making an appointment at a clinic for hormones. I\u2019m definitely not ruling it out for the future, either. I\u2019ve just never felt like being a man suited me. I guess I never considered that inside I might identify as a woman. It makes sense that I would, given everything I\u2019ve tried to explain. But what I\u2019ve always felt and acknowledged is that part of why I struggle is I don\u2019t know what type of man I want to be. I\u2019ve always tried to dream up and act upon versions of the type of man I think I want to be, but it never felt right so I\u2019d sort of just fade out from whatever it was I was trying to accomplish. Has anyone ever felt like this? I did spend time looking at dresses and outfits today and was really aroused and interested in exploring that. That was also a first for me. If anyone has any input they\u2019d like to offer, I would honestly love to hear it. I\u2019m not sad or depressed about this, so please don\u2019t feel obligated. In fact this \u201cclick\u201d I felt has actually awoken something in me. I feel very \u201con the right path\u201d - if that makes sense. It may turn out this is just a phase, or a furthering of my already expanding gender fluid ways. Who knows. I just wanted to hear from others to see if any of what I\u2019m saying resonates with anyone else.\n\nThanks!", "date": "2018-11-09 00:14:39", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9vfj38/when_and_how_did_you_know/", "author": "chiborg9999"}, {"title": "tried to come out to my mother today. she thought i was joking &amp; said if i wasn't, she would pray for me.", "text": "", "date": "2018-11-09 00:27:16", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9vfmnj/tried_to_come_out_to_my_mother_today_she_thought/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "So question", "text": "So I am a trans girl but I haven't started the hormone treatment, I just wanted to know if I would still be able to orgasm and be able to enjoy sex or masturbation?", "date": "2018-11-09 00:36:58", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9vfper/so_question/", "author": "Nightmare_shifter"}, {"title": "Need some help!", "text": "so I made some female friends over discord and we want to do a D&amp;D game they all know I'm trans but it'd be nice if I could sound like a girl does anyone know a good voice changer?", "date": "2018-11-09 01:11:05", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/9vfyum/need_some_help/", "author": "Closet_gal"}, {"title": "Questions for trans musicians and singers", "text": "I'm 18yo male musician and i'm thinking about hrt, and since it's a really important thing i figured that talking to colleagues that already undergone it would definitely help more.\nDid it affected the way you approach to music?\nDid it affected your tastes?\nDid it affected your singing?

I base this message of personal experiences and from what I have read in other articles.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is interesting to see how transmen are not nearly portrayed in as a negative light as\n\ntranswomen. For one thing transwomen get a lot more publicity and are looked down on, and seen\n\nas traps and fake. Yet there is a pretty even distribution of MTFs and FTMs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust because someone grows up as a specific gender biologically they are placed in circumstances\n\nwhere they have to learn to be a certain way to be included and practically brainwashed. Based of\n\nor physical appearances we are divided and taught to make these divisions clearer by being each\n\nothers opposites gender wise. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMany transpersons live after these expectations as it is so hardly imprinted in most people's\n\nminds that things are black and white. There are a lot of intersex conditions, and also transpeople\n\nhave been shown in studies to have underlying biological explanations, and even then there is\n\nthe emotional and energetic level humans not yet understand well through science at least.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA person born male but feeling the opposite will probably suppress their inner self because\n\nthey have grown up with expectation of being what they look like and we live in a society where\n\nfeelings matter less than facts. So this transwoman will have dysphoria usually but be confused about\n\nwhat is up or/and try to suppress this. Both because of fear of being looked down on, rejection and\n\nbeing an outcast. Their families will have a hard time seeing what has not been there physically\n\nor visibly, and in many cases explain it away as something that is not real.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who are not transgender, will not always understand that this is real and have only recently\n\nbeen seeing transpeople portrayed in a negative light in movies or through media lately.\n\nThus thinking all these \"new\" trans people are fake and only coming to light because it is in the\n\nmedia a lot more. However, the truth is, this is a movement where people will start to reveal\n\ntheir true selves when they see others doing it and feel more empowered and comfortable as it is more\n\npublic. It is not a result of just jumping on an interesting new trend.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople who are not transgender will just see this new publicity and new found concepts in media and\n\nthink that it is just something weird people want to try out or similar(that is my understanding of\n\nsome people). They did not know about this before and think it just recently came into being.\n\nBut it has always been there. People are not used to this and to them it seems surreal, awkward, strange,\n\nweird and they might be uncomfortable or feel like something is being taken from their gender.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you are a cisperson(feeling like the gender you were born), then imagine for a second that you were\n\nborn in the opposite gender or somewhere in-between. Imagine that you somehow have a constant nagging\n\ngut-feeling that something is wrong. It is the fact that you are not what you seem like. It is\n\nlike suddenly waking up in another life and another gender, with new memories but a sense, a feeling that\n\nyou are supposed to be something else. This is what it is about.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeing a transperson is not a decision, and not necessarily something you want. It is something that\n\njust IS. Just like many people just are comfortable with the gender they are born with. It just is\n\na state of being.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all disease existing and so on in a modern world of chemicals being used without long-term\n\neffects in mind we can't possibly know what these things used in products, food and the air will have\n\nas an affect on us. Maybe transpeople are partially a result of something similar. Just as some\n\npeople are born with ADHD, without and arm or impaired in someway.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople in general are not yet used to seeing people in-between genders and feel like there is an\n\ninvasion on their territory or afraid that they will end up with someone not being what they seem\n\nlike. We just need to get more used to things we didn't previously think existed, but actually did.\n\nIt is like the idea of using a phone today talking out into thin air would be ridiculous maybe 50 - 100\n\nyears ago. The idea of the technologic advances made today would be ridiculous 20 year ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are adaptable beings who get used to things. Eventually things will be facts and not about\n\nholding on to a stubborn belief.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDon't imagine how weird it is for you because someone close to you is \"weird\" for thinking they are\n\ntransgender and it previously seemed inconceivable. Instead imagine how hard it must be for that\n\nperson having lived a lie and try to convince or be comfortable amongst people who see this\n\nas something opposite as normal.

Also, let me know if any of the terms I used are offensive or outdated as I am super new!\n\nWithin the past few months, I have started to think that there is a good possibility I am trans, and I just wanted to reach out to the community to learn from people who have gone through the struggle first hand. \n\nMy experiences so far have been fast, and seemingly out of nowhere. I was talking to my significant other about some experiences in my youth I thought were just normal guy things. When I was young, like 7-15 I would dress up as a girl whenever I was left home alone at school. Along with painting my nails and that kind of thing. I, of course, hid it, because my father is fairly, well Conservative. I was raised to be a real man's man but never really lived up to that because my interest was always in music and writing, along with science and just hanging out with my girlfriends. \n\nAnyway, after some discussion, we both realized that dressing up as a girl was kind of only the tip of the iceberg, as I recalled planning when I was younger to go out and get breast implants and just simply hide them forever (this was clearly asinine due to being like 10).  \n\nMy significant other btw came out to me as essentially transmasculine when we had been dating a while, because he felt as if he was in the wrong body and had done tons of research. So when I brought up the whole I wish I was feminine thing, he had seen this kind of stuff before and started to ask questions and didn\u2019t jump to any conclusions, in fact, any conclusions I have come to at this point have been my own. \n\nI decided to do some research and have done some thinking and have realized that I may just be trans. I am very indifferent to how I look and behave as a male, and have always enjoyed speech patterns of females and just in general how expressive they are. I honestly have emulated that in my own life unknowingly and have been alienated from most male crowds unless I turn on hyper-masculinity which I don\u2019t really enjoy doing as it\u2019s a chore. I honestly just dress comfortable and have never really had any passion about looks until I tried cross-dressing like a month ago. Now I have found it relieving and I look forward to it almost every day. \n\nI do have some questions for anyone willing to answer, is it normal for such a sudden realization? Also, I personally have never cared how people have viewed me, as in, people calling me male pronouns just doesn\u2019t bother me. I would rather go by female pronouns in personal life, but in everyday life, I just could not possibly care less. Is that normal or non-dysphoric?\n\nI really appreciate any of those willing to answer some questions, and I would love to get to know the trans community better. This is all so new and honestly scary but exciting to at least confront these old issues. \n\nTl;dr\n\nI have suspicions I may be trans, because I have always wanted to behave feminine but due to my upbringing cant. I wonder if its normal for these feelings to pop up so suddenly, and is it irregular to not care about pronouns except with close loved ones? Also, I would love to get to know the community!

I'm young, white, born male, middle class, had a safe childhood, my parents are together and love each other, the white picket fence with dogs and a cat and the whole enchilada. We're not the richest family in the world by any means, but I grew up in a loving household that was pretty damn privileged.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhile I am not recalling a true inciting incident for my egg cracking, I'm fairly certain I could no longer deny my bisexuality around 2 years ago, and I am still in the closet to my friends and family (although sometimes it feels like an open secret). I was a freshman in college at the time, and a new student came in, and he was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen. Sandy and short hair, beautiful blue eyes, and the coolest, most confident thrifty style. As we shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, a chill ran down my spine and my stomach got butterflies. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSince childhood, I have been girl-crazy, and while I had seen some men in passing that I did not necessarily find hard to look at, my attraction towards girls was so strong that I probably just overlooked pretty dudes. This guy is a very close friend of mine now, and I am in a long term relationship with my girlfriend of 5 years. He is the first boy to ever make me feel dizzy with love like so many girls did all through my childhood up to now. I kept it cool and headed to the dorm to eat dinner and work on homework, but I instead spent the evening replaying our introduction in my head, and well, the pieces connected quickly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA couple weeks afterwards, I listened to Transgender Dysphoria Blues for the first time in my car after class. Me and my buddies from High School had been fans of Against Me! since around New Wave days, and we live in the town that one of their records was cut, so we had a distant connection to them. I had only listened to their material from White Crosses and prior, and somehow didn't know that Grace had transitioned.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was quite nervous while starting the record, although at the time I was not sure why. Well, the album happened. I resonated with many of the lyrics; forgotten memories of grade-school dysphoria bubbled to the surface like bile in my throat, but like with my encounter with my classmate, I kept it cool and bottled my feelings down until I felt nothing, just like a ''real man\" does. Unknowingly, I had been repressing my own feelings and convinced myself that it was just a great album, which it is.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParalytic States came on. Down to the riff, it sounds like it was written just for me, the melody, riff, and lyrics conjured places, moods, and colors that I had never been able to articulate in my own art. In the chorus \"Paralytic States of dependency, all waking life is just a living dream, agitated states of amazement, never quite the woman that she wanted to be, never quite the woman that she wanted to me,\" memories came flooding back from early childhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know why I got so paranoid with my girlfriend cheating, but only with girls\n\nThere was a reason why I sat in the bathroom for hours, crying and staring at the fat on my jaw and the size of my shoulders\n\nNow I know why seeing a girl that was too beautiful in person would ruin a day or a week for me\n\nThere was an explanation for the hundreds of hours I must have spent in the mirror, pinching my sides and sucking in my cheeks to look angular, constantly shaving my face and armpits to feel comfortable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was five years old, my mother was downstairs cooking and my toddler sister was napping in my parents' room.\n\nAs quietly as I could, I snuck from my bedroom into my sister's room. Holding the closet door tightly to cover the squeaking, I hid and tried on a tight white blouse of my sister's. It had a low cut neck with deep red roses. I cracked open the closet door to allow just enough light in so I could look at myself. I felt pretty, I felt right. I loved the way the cloth was tight, but soft. I got goosebumps from its clinging to my skin, and I became manic and euphoric in a way that I only have a handful of times in my life, jumping up and down and grinning and giggling to myself in the purest form of happiness I might have ever felt.\n\nMy next thought was that boys don't do this. This is wrong. Pretty clothes are for girls, and I'm not a girl, I'm a boy. I took the blouse off as fast as I could and put it back, and went downstairs to watch TV.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlmost 20 years later, I'm ignoring my roommates' texts and writing this in a maternity dress and shitty leggings that I bought with cash from Walgreens, with my glasses off so I look more like a girl in the mirror. A band I was in played a show in dresses, and during the performance, I felt that same feeling I had as a child, and we had a great show. The other guys put their dresses in storage, but I kept mine and forgot about it until Against Me!'s album. I went home and snuck it out of my closet and tried it on at home and the feeling returned. \n\nStill, I doubt myself constantly, but I guess the constant doubt is only more affirmation, in a weird way.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks to anybody that read this.

You do not need to be currently insured to participate in this study. If you choose to participate I will ask you to do two things: a brief demographics survey online, and an interview talking about your experiences. The online survey will ask you questions about your age, ethnicity, gender identity, etc. The interview will take place at a location and time that is most convenient and comfortable for you (e.g. in-person, over the phone, or video chat). Your participation in this study will remain anonymous to all others but the researchers. To participate you have to be at least 19 years old, and identify as Transgender, Genderqueer, or Gender Non-Binary. In total, participating in this study will take approximately 55 to 75 minutes.

Well, not even a month after we've arrived we're getting thrown to the curb in the middle of November. We both just got jobs but with only one car and one of the jobs having been in walking distance of the place we were staying, we are likely to lose one of them and it's going to put us both into homelessness. We don't have money to get an apartment or efficiency so if we don't get some kind of help soon, we will end up living out of our car.\n\n\nWe came here to live with my girlfriend's family after being in a very abusive situation with my girlfriends dad for a year, a man who physically assaulted my girlfriend multiple times during that period. Her mom told us that if we came and lived with her that she promised we won't be homeless, said it straight to my girlfriends face after her crying on the couch when we got here over the thought that she might end up being homeless.\n\n\nIt's a dangerous world, and for two trans girls living on the streets, with the murder and rape numbers for transwomen, neither she nor I feel safe. To kick us more, we're getting thrown out in winter where it get's down to the negatives here, so we'd be lucky to even survive that let alone the potential threat of rape and possibly murder that we would face living on the streets alone to fend for ourselves.\n\n\nI'd get it if we were a cis straight couple or even gay couple because they would be able to force themselves to not stand out, but we've both been on hormones for years now and we wouldn't be able to conceal our gender or sexuality very well to protect ourselves if we ended up becoming homeless and forced around people who generally don't take very kindly to people of different genders and sexualities than their own.\n\n\nSo, we've come here to ask for any help we can get, big or small, to support us and repair a false promise and to ensure our survival in this cruel, cruel world.

We were getting close to his place and the thought of telling him who I really was had been at the back of my mind for the entire trip. \n\nIt finally struck me that as close as we are, if i couldn't come out to him I couldn't say it to anyone else. I was nervous and as scared as I've ever been. My mouth tasted like metal and my heart was racing. I couldn't think of a good way to say it so I just told him out right \"I'm transgender\" and then proceeded to tell him how I've felt since I was 13, how I've fought myself and hated myself for so long before I came to accept it. I told him how I'd been feeling the pressure to let myself out building and building these last few years, how I felt i would explode if I couldn't be my true self.  \n\n After I finished, the car was quiet for only a second but it felt like a lifetime, I still didn't know how he'd react but then he said \"I 100% support you, I'm glad you came out to me, because I've been wanting to come out to you, I'm gay.\" It's almost funny, both afraid to show our true selves for so long, hiding behind our masks. But here we are opening ourselves up for the first time. We ended up hanging out at his place for a while and talking about things and comparing nail polish.

This was in part due to an experience that I had recently, but I wanna share how I got there.\n\nAs a preface I always had the sneaking suspicion that I wasn't really a guy on the inside. 2 or 3 years ago I tossed around the idea maybe I was trans, but because of many other more pressing things going on I suppressed that and just distracted myself with computers and video games.\n\nI used to view certain emotions and sensations as \"bad\" and things that should be avoided. And (partially) as a result I lived my life having very stunted and almost non-existent feeling and emotionality, with only recent months opening up to experiencing *anything*, whether it be something we commonly judge as \"positive\" or \"negative\".\n\nA wise person once told me that it's perfectly okay to feel. To \"be fully present in your body and in this moment\". I intellectually knew this but I never truly practiced it and implemented it. That is, until this most recent Thanksgiving. Before this my focus in life was on very different things, and the idea of being trans wasn't even anywhere on it (at least not consciously).\n\nI was sitting in my mom's car being driven to a dinner we were going to, and I decided to just put my headphones down, stop listening to music, and just sit there. I took deep breaths and just allowed myself to observe whatever was going on internally and externally. More specifically, I decided to do this while feeling like I was fully *in* my body rather just in my head like normal.\n\nIn just moments I was feeling true gender dysphoria for the first time. I felt how my penis truly felt like some weird additional appendage that shouldn't have been there. Later on I had a moment when I really felt the testosterone in my bloodstream, and the dysphoria was getting pretty intense. And now even as I type this I occasionally feel like breasts both are and aren't there (phantom breasts you could say). Most trans folk I imagine would call this suffering, but I'm actually extremely grateful for this feeling. Because it's actually a feeling that truly and fully felt with my entire being. I fully embrace it if it ever comes up.\n\nAfter my initial experience of dysphoria subsided, I was (and still am) excited because I know now without a doubt. Everything is clicking into place. To really feel something with your entire being is something truly special, and something I haven't really experienced in this life until now. Sure I'd occasionally feel some type of emotion or sensation, but it never truly *came out* if that makes sense. This does, and I have this knowing that if I do begin to transition other emotions of mine will follow.\n\nI know there will be a lot of challenges ahead, and my dysphoria comes and goes with varying intensity. But I'm actually really eager to face this, and I'd like to share some of that positivity with you all. I hope that no matter where anyone is in their journey, they will feel at least a little fired up to face whatever it is they are facing.

It was a difficult post to write as I only had 160 characters in the app!\n\nSuch a lot to answer... firstly, my therapist is supportive. She says that we\u2019re working towards me accepting myself for who I am, whether that means that I am in fact trans or not; from what I\u2019ve told her, she thinks that my trans feelings are rooted in something else to do with my relationship with my parents, so she sees it as a symptom of something else. \n\nHave I tried drag? Well, I\u2019ve been cross-dressing since I was left alone at home, so for about 25 years. I still do when I get the chance. I used to be very much related to masturbation, a way to get off, and it left me feeling dirty afterwards. Since I\u2019ve started therapy I have noticed a change in my attitude towards cross-dressing, and I enjoy it, and the sexual part annoys me now; I\u2019d love to cross-dress without feeeling that it will end in masturbation.\n\nSo this is part of my problem; my therapist thinks that my trans feelings will disappear as we sort out the causes behind them; but at the moment, therapy is only increasing these feelings. So much of what I do in my everyday life is to make me feel more feminine; I have long hair (excuse: for my theatre group), I paint my nails regularly (to undo gender stereotypes for my kids), but these are escuses, when I\u2019m actually doing it to feel like a woman. So, if having long hair is part of cross-dressing for me, how can this feeling gradually disappear?\n\nAs regards the \u201cenvy\u201d thing, there may be problems with translation. I live in Spain, so I may be translating the words used badly; my therapist thinks that I\u2019m jealous of women, inasmuch as I want what they have (which is true); but for me, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to be a man that does everything \u201cgirly\u201d; I don\u2019t want to be a man that wears skirts, I\u2019d rather be a woman that wears trousers.\n\nAs regards dysphoria, I\u2019ve never really hated my body; I don\u2019t like it, and I don\u2019t take my t-shirt off on the beach if I can help it. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019ve always been into \u201cgirly\u201dthings either, as it\u2019s a label I don\u2019t really like. I like electric guitars, but I also like sewing (talking of which, I also like putting up shelves and making shit from wood, but to be honest I see sewing and making a bookcase as both being activities that create something and far more similar that most people reckon). I\u2019m certainly not a masculine man, but I am quite big (5ft 11.5 inches / 1.83m - 88kg), so I feel that as a woman I\u2019d always be too big.\n\nJeez, sorry for such a long post!

I've always dressed masculine, I wear men's clothes (because of the \"pockets\" I claim) now. My hair is long, but I wish it could be shorter. 2 or 3 years ago, when I was about 11 or 12, I first heard the term transgender. I never knew it was possible to change your birth gender. Nobody had ever told me before. I was convinced that was the case and I foolishly told my brother. He reacted like I was stupid and joking, so I just played it off as a joke. I haven't told anyone since. In those 2 years, I've done a lot of thinking. I'm not sure that I can be trans. My parents seem to think I'm their sweet little angel, and my dad even has my female name tattooed on him. If I were trans, I'd probably ruin their lives or something. I'd lose all my friends too. Plus I'm not even sure if I'm trans. Yeah, if there were a magical pill to take to become male, I'd take it in a heartbeat, but I don't want to be trans. I hate my body, but I can't change it. I hate the idea of being a woman but doesn't everybody? Isn't it normal to want to be a different gender?  I especially have been getting frustrated lately. Whenever I'm around relatives for the holidays, they use words like \"she\" and \"girl\". Those words make me hate myself. Do cisgender people do that?

I don\u2019t know if any males that he is friends with.\n- he bought and mentioned to me about reading a fantasy/sci-fi book featuring a main character who is trans\n- he downloaded and showed me an app/video game all about a trans character (One Night, Hot Springs). This and the above book are what make me wonder if he could be trying to subtly hint to me\n- he has dealt with pretty significant depression issues in the past. He has never gone in depth with me about \u201croot\u201d issues for him (not that I expect him to or would push him to) but it doesn\u2019t seem purely chemical given that he is not on meds.

For the first time since I was probably born, my grandparents are not invited to my birthday party. They were like a second set of parents for me, and they've been there with my family and I every single step of the way. I still love them, to say the least. \n\nBut after I came out, they responded to my letter to them with a letter of their own. Mine was peaceful and cordial, and I wrote it solely because I was too nervous to speak and I knew they would need some help understanding me. I soon got a letter back, which I've thrown out, because it infuriates me.\n\nAmong other things in the five-page letter they wrote back (too be fair, mine was just a long, but I didn't even bother reading past page two.), they said **\"a man cannot be a woman, and a woman cannot be a man, as decreed by God\"**, and that the reason I'm feeling this way (seemingly my entire life) is because **\"the devil is whispering in my ear\"**.\n\nI'm not paraphrasing. I'm not summarizing. Those are their *exact* words.\n\nThose words make me want to punch a hole in the fucking wall (and this exchange happened a month or two ago)! I remembered how worried they were when I used to be extremely depressed, or I wouldn't come out of my rooms for a day or two. They always said they'd support me, as they just wanted me to be happy. Lo and behold, I'm having the time of my life, as I'm finally starting to be comfortable with myself. And they abandoned me like trash. I guess I've expired my usefulness.\n\nI don't know what to feel. I have a million emotions flying through my head at the moment and its 00:49. I'm sad I had to lose them over something like this, but I'm also pissed off that I resort to this just so I don't feel like a freak. I still haven't told them, but I don't know how I'm going to tell them that they're not welcome in the very house the helped build. That's all I can do really, I guess.

I am a 35 year old male and last month or two I have been struggling with the question above. I have been fantasizing about what it would be like as a female for around 20 years, but always believed it was nothing more that that. I have asked myself the trans question over those 20 years a lot and my answer (until recently) was always no. But (I think) mainly because I didn't want to be a transwoman. Mainly because of my believe that transwomen could never 100% pass (forgive my ignorance here please). And because becoming an actual natural women was not an option I always left it at that. However I have been looking at /r/transtimelines lately and I feel it has changed my mind on the transwoman option a little. So I have been thinking some more about it and here are my (conflicting) conclusions, so I hoped the lovely people in this subreddit could provide some objective advice.\n\n**Why I think I am trans:**\n\n* If I had a button that would permanently transform me into a natural female, would I press it? Yes\n* I have been \"into\" gender transformation art (like [tgcomics.com](https://tgcomics.com)) for over 10 years now\n* I am mesmerized by the female filter of FaceApp on the phone. It has created tons of cute female versions of myself\n* 95% of my sexual fantasies are about me being or transforming into a woman.\n* I envy woman I see in public if they have long hair or are wearing leggings, skinny jeans or a dress. Women have so much more options in clothing it's not even funny.\n* If I have the option to play as a female in any kind of game (or d&amp;d), I do. And not \"so I can look at a female body all day\" or whatever that excuse is.\n\n**Why I think I am not trans:**\n\n* I am living a happy life. I have a wife and a son whom I love dearly.\n* I don't see myself as a female trapped in a wrong body. I'd like to be one, but I don't feel like one.\n* If I look in the mirror I don't feel anything negative, more like boredom or indifference.\n* I have a male mind with male mannerisms. I have studied (as in, read a few books on the subject, not created an actual thesis) the psychological differences between men and women and I definitely fit in the male category.\n* I feel way more \"at home\" in a group of men than in a group of women.\n* I can see myself living a happy life and growing old as a man.

Masculinity is not a part of my identity. You could take my \"manhood\" (literally and figuratively) away from me and that would not hurt my identity at all.

I've always been a bit feminine (like i was always extremely sensitive and in-touch with my feelings, or i used to hide and play dress up games or romance games on my phone). But 8 days ago i was at family wedding and saw one of my female cousins (who everyone is saying i look like a male version of if that means anything?) wearing this dress and i thought to myself \"damn, that is nice, i wish i wore something like that\". But then i had to catch myself like \"wait, what? I'm a boy, i don't wear dresses?!' But the thought kept nagging at me all night, and i really liked it.  \n\n\nSo we get home, and i immediately hop on my laptop, pull up discord, and spam my 2 transgender friends (they're both ftm. We'll call them Friend and D. Also Friend is pan and D is ace if that also means anything?) I don't give anything away, but i ask them some questions, and the questions are basically all somewhere along the lines of \"do you do boy stuff a lot, and didn't realise it was boy stuff, like u just thought u were weird\" and then hit them with the big \"before you knew u were trans, did u ever see a boy wearing specific clothing and been like \"jesus i would love to wear that\" and then be like \"wait wot, hol up\". Both of them gave a big fat YES to every questions, so i hit them with the \"I think i might be trans\"  \n\n\nSo they've been guiding me a lot recently, explaining how the whole thing works (psychologist, surgery, etc) and have been really good at answering my questions and just helping me understand wtf is going on. Anyways, i have a friend (we'll call him N). N is a 27 year old gaming streamer who lives on the other side of the globe, but i was his first follower that wasn't an irl friend, his first mod that wasn't an irl friend, i do the graphic design side of his stream, and i set up his discord. He sees me as a little brother, and we have a great connection, so since i don't have to see him face to face on a daily basis, N seemed like the perfect person to talk to about this. So i questioned him, and he gave me 2 very good pieces of advice. 1. You are 14, everyone else you know is most likely asking themselves the exact same questions (Am i a boy? A girl? Do i like boys? Girls? Both? Neither? Does this make me weird? Do they know what i'm thinking?), so don't do anything rash, make sure you are sure, and 2. A good way for you to find out would be to go shopping with a girl and just have a browse, try it.  \n\n\nSo i don't have a gf, or any girls that i hang out with outside of school really, so that would be difficult, but i thought \"Hey, i could use the online shops\". So i decided to just pull up 2 shopping websites. Rebel (sports), and Target (Department). Just jackets/jumpers, tops, and bottoms from these to shops made up 33 screenshots (and no screenshots of the same style of clothing e.g. hoodies, jeans, leggings etc). Basically, i love it.   \n\n\nEvery day has been coming with new realisations of stuff i've been doing that i just thought was either normal or me being weird. Things such as fantasising about being female in many scenarios, or using 2 towels, or hugging everyone, tying up my hair, and many more little things that i can't think of at the moment, that can easily be dismissed as not important, but when piling up, and combined with everything else, they don't seem so easy to dismiss.  \n\n\nAnd that brings us to me making this post. So here is where we stand:  \n\n\n**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM TRANS:**\n\n\\- The vast majority of my fantasies are about or involve me being female  \n\\- I am constantly sneaking looks at women wearing makeup and envying it  \n\\- I love the female clothing selection so much more than the men's section  \n\\- I do a lot of minor feminine things by instinct, not by instillment such as many of my masculine actions  \n\\- I feel like i would be a lot more comfortable being female than male  \n\\- If i could choose to just magically wake up one day and be female, I would  \n\n\n**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM NOT TRANS:**  \n\\- I am much more comfortable talking to and being friends with boys than girls  \n\\- If i look in the mirror and see myself, i do not feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, nor do i hate my appearance. I   \n  would just be much more comfortable in a girl's body  \n\\- I act like a male (rough and sporty, swearing a lot, gaming, i love stereotypical male activities)  \nEDIT\n\\- I also would not be comfortable wearing girls clothes and makeup while still looking like a boy\n\\- I know that until I make the transition I would be fine with people calling me by he/him/boy/male \n\n\nI think that sums it up more or less. I've probably missed a few details here and there, but this should be good enough to go by.

I've been attracted to androgyny my whole life. Many years ago, I had an intense romantic relationship with a woman who presented as male. She didn't take hormones, hadn't had surgery, and she was still using female pronouns. She often passed as male, though. She said she would consider herself trans but couldn't bother with the hoop jumping involved (again, this was a long time ago.)\n\nI've been attracted to men with a feminine appearance for a long time as well. My early boyfriends as a teen had long hair, for example. One of them I dressed in my lingerie and put makeup on, for my own titillation. I've been in the kink scene for quite some time now as a Domme. I only want submissive boys who have a twink body type, who have no facial or chest hair, and  I strongly prefer they have feminine features and long hair. \n\nI thought that I was a (primarily) heterosexual woman. Well... I met someone and I'm really not sure what to do now. This person self identifies as a mtf transsexual, uses female pronouns, and takes hormones but has not had surgery. She does not pass. Normally I would think I'd not be a match for someone like that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER. We met at a kink event and hit it off right away. She's smart and sarcastically funny like me, and she is the most generous and kind person. In the past, lots of people have used and hurt her. I really really don't want to be another person who hurts her. \n\nI can't believe how hard I'm falling, and so quick. It's insane. It's like we were meant to be together. I feel so comfortable with her, and I'm very physically attracted as well. I could see myself in a long term committed relationship with her- even up to and including marriage. My parents are chill as fuck and would not care as long as I'm happy.\n\nHere's the problem- and I expect I'll be called ugly names and told to fuck right off (hence the throwaway)- I don't see her as female. There's a Y chromosome and male genitalia in play- and while I support her right to do as she wishes, I do not see that combination as being the same as a person with XX and female genitals. I've heard lots of arguments that don't hold water with me. I am absolutely nuts over her- but to me she's a more extreme version of a feminine man like the others I've dated. \n\nSo here's the question: Should I leave her, so she can try and find a relationship with someone who does subscribe to her identity as being female? I don't want to do that. I want to be with her. I would do anything to avoid hurting her like the chasers and other assorted shitheels she's had to deal with have done. If I turn around and say \"Hey, I don't really see you as a woman\" that would probably hurt her a lot too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease, I'm a good person trying to do the right thing by someone who I care about.

Knew from as young as three, had the \"boy stuck in a girl's body\" mentality, strong opposition to traditionally feminine stuff and strong preference for traditionally masculine stuff, etc.. But my question is in regards to the sense of self and personality.\n\nI realized from as young as three that my idea of who I was conflicted with the way others saw me, not just as far as gender, but also personality. I didn't pay it much attention because, well, I was three. I only started to really think about it once I was around nine or ten. It felt like I couldn't be myself around my family the way I could at school around my friends. My family didn't like it when I was a rambunctious, happy, fun-loving little boy. I felt like I had to be completely silent and emotionless around them to live up to their pre-created ideal of me as their \"shy, quiet little girl.\" And even if I was myself around them, it didn't feel right to know that they were still seeing me as that girl. Plus, my mom made it very clear to me that she would only love me if I was a girl. The only affection she showed me was super gendered, and although she didn't refuse to buy me boy clothes, she made sure to make me feel guilty about it the whole time.\n\nI was excited for middle school because I was convinced that I would go through male puberty due to having a male brain. I thought that my body would finally catch up with my brain and everything would fall into place; my family would finally learn that I was a boy, I could go to middle school as a boy, I could finally express myself and my personality without hesitation or fear. But of course that didn't happen. Once I learned that it wasn't going to happen and I'd have to go to middle school as a girl, I sort of fell into a depression. I figured, \"I have to grow up and be a girl now,\" but all I knew about being a girl was being silent, not saying anything, not forming opinions or having beliefs. Basically just existing as little as possible. I assumed that that was who I was, because that made the adults happy, and obviously they knew more about everything than I did because they were adults and I was just a kid.\n\nI stayed like that for the rest of middle school and through all of high school as well, though I think I did get a few more aspects of my old personality back once I started living as a guy junior year. But I still feel like I'm not allowed to have a personality or beliefs or anything. I'm trying to go back to being the outgoing, fun-loving little dude I was in fifth grade because that really felt like it was me. But it's really hard. I'm so used to being this emotionless, voiceless person that everyone wanted me to be that it's hard to shake that off of me.\n\nSo my question is, does anybody else feel this way? Like they had to abandon their real personality at a certain age just to please the role their family forced them into because of their birth sex? If so, how did you go about finding yourself afterwards? I'm not just talking about gender identity here, as we've obviously all had to hide that before. I mean personality. I figure gender identity and personality are linked, and it seems like so many trans people are totally able to embrace their personalities just after coming out and starting transition. I've been living as a guy for two years now, but I still feel stuck in this regard and am looking to change.

I\u2019m light on my feet and almost dancing, deciding in each split second how slowly or quickly I should attack the ball in a way I can not even predict. If I drop my ball I can freely express my emotions of joy and frustration by spinning or bounding with my body.\n\nMy lover even picked me up yesterday, and I held on to her by wrapping my legs around her waist as she spun me around. Right then I was overwhelmed with gender euphoria, and felt so authentic and feminine.\n\nThere is even an aspect to masculinity that many men feel uncomfortable being touched, physically comforted and nurtured, but they are comfortable being the ones touching their partners. Imagine a loved one just holding you while stroking your hair or cheek.\n\nI feel a lot more confident speaking up about my feelings, and I don\u2019t care about appearing strong and stoic anymore, I can be silly and that has changed the basic relationship I have when I inhabit my body. \n\nI have a much larger emotional range I am comfortable feeling inside myself and expressing. Sometimes it feels good to feel weak and helpless till tears start running down my cheeks.\n\nI think most men are afraid of inhabiting their bodies in that way because they are afraid of being seen as gay. It takes a lot of work to actively overcome that fear, and I doubt many men would do that unless they felt they had to, because it is very scaring knowing people see you as something different.\n\nIf you want to see how scared you are try painting your fingernails and then go to the supermarket. Very few people would actually care about the slightly effeminate stranger, but I\u2019m sure most of you would be very uncomfortable, I was.

Mtf, obviously.\n\nI just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere to maybe get a few in return. Here we go. (A few f-bombs ahead, if anyone gets _t r i g g e r e d_ by that.)\n\nIf you ask me, I'm not trans. I'm a woman. That's just it. Although there's that nagging voice in my head trying to question my validity, I have had conversations with girls about \"typical girl things\" and they totally knew what I was talking about, to the point of even blushing when the topics got a bit, erm, _oolala_. I hold onto that, because it proves to me that I don't have to learn how to be a woman because I'm trans, I already am. The more comfortable/happy I feel, the more happens automatically, including movement (move dem hips), gestures, voice modulation and so on.\nBeing trans is just the term to unite all the different aspects of my position for people who aren't in my shoes, which are a lot of course. Not the shoes, the people I mean. I'm too broke to buy shoes yet.\n\nAnd sure, I look in the mirror and some boyish lad stares back at me, but in the end that's hopefully temporary. I've got my first contact appointment in about a month. Let's hope I get my tiddyskittles quickly, because considering my body hair growth I'm either very slowly becoming a werewolf who doesn't care about moonphases or the last sorry bits of puberty are trying to finish the job, fss. \n\nAnyway, for that exact reason I want to go full time stealth except maybe for some close friends that I might make in my new home town. When I've got my hormones and wardrobe sorted out, I'm _done_. Just fucking _done_. Maybe I'm mistaken in saying this, but as soon as I start passing, it'll be irrelevant for people to know I'm trans. Not that it is now, but I can't help people making a doubletake when looking at me right now.\n\nI hear a lot something along the lines of \"I can't do this now, I've got too much at stake in career and this and that\" Well, I haven't got a career and I desperately need to start getting a job so I can stay with my girlfriend and combat my depression, but I'd rather jump into the fire and flame on than sit everything out and keep decaying. Other problems be damned, I'm taking them on all at once!\n\nI think I'm done here. Hope I didn't offend or destroy someone's morale with the last bit, but I had to put it out there somewhere just to have said it once.\nSo yea, if you're sure about who you are and you're hesitant to transition, then I'd say: Just do it. You deserve and owe it to yourself. I stalled an entire year and I fucking hate that I did; I could have had so much hormonal progress in that one year. Instead I tucked it away and dissociated until I nearly fell apart completely.\nSo yea do it, in a safe way, as best as you can.\nGo gettit! \n\n\n", "date": "2018-12-09 13:48:16", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a4l2vm/musings_about_going_stealth/", "author": "lillywho"}, {"title": "Buying male clothing for the first time", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2018-12-09 14:42:02", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a4lenp/buying_male_clothing_for_the_first_time/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Me chillin in my handmade trans hoodie!", "text": "Me chillin in my handmade trans hoodie!

I feel like I'm dreaming or just not quite in my body even though I can still feel myself in my different limbs.\nThis introspection also clearly shows me that I can't find my way back and break the dam in parts due to \"my soul\", if you will, not being in tune with my body. It feels like there's an energy that expects the body to be a certain way to flow correctly, but it isn't so it creates a huge dissonance. If that metaphor makes any sense. (Would be great to have feedback on that, I'm not quite sure how to talk to my upcoming therapist about it.)\n And I've heard starting HRT alleviates a lot of mood issues, does this also apply to dissociation that is strictly _not_ related to dysphoria? I'd be grateful for experience reports that are as detailed as it is comfortable for you to write.

I came out a year ago to my fiancee, at the time. she was supportive immediately after, but all on all, shes a hardcore lesbian. So us staying together was out of the picture. She didnt understand that after I came out, if she didnt see me as a man, it wouldnt work.  after that she started to cheat on me, like getting a new relationship type of cheat. and was literally going to move out with this person. she told me she needed a \"real women\". So I submitted to that and basically took back my coming out to her and my friends. I started wearing makeup again, around december of last year. And I was so comfortable and happy with guy pronouns. I kind of always knew this is what I was. Now Im kind of numb to myself, I dont recognize myself in the mirror. I dont connect with my body. Its hard to believe, when I look in the mirror, that thats...me. is this just me?\n\nthanks!

I\u2019m currently 18. \n\nWhen I was a young kid, I hated girl toys and girl clothes. I would refuse to wear dresses or skirts or anything girly. I wanted to wear boy clothes but my mom wouldn\u2019t let me. I loved playing with cars and dinosaurs. I thought I was a tomboy at this time. I didn\u2019t know transgender existed. \n\nWhen I was 14, it turned from thinking I was a tomboy to \u201cI want to be a boy/I wish I was a boy.\u201d I told my mom that at a store because we were both looking at clothes in the women\u2019s section and whenever I picked out something I liked she would always say \u201cthat looks like boy clothes\u201d. I told her I wished I was a boy and she said \u201cstop it\u201d and got mad at me. \n\nWhenever I go shopping for clothes, I rarely find anything I like in the women\u2019s section (and if I do it\u2019s more general neutral looking, not girly), but when I go in the men\u2019s section I like almost everything. \n\nI workout with my female friends sometimes. They all focus on workouts that will make their butts bigger, while I focus on my muscles because I want biceps and a six pack. I get angry because it\u2019s so much easier for guys to achieve those than women.\n\nI like being recognized as male. If someone online uses male pronouns when talking to me it makes me happy. When it\u2019s cold outside I like to wear a big hoodie and stuff all my hair inside the hood so I can maybe pass as a guy. Once I was accidentally in someone\u2019s way and I said sorry and he said \u201cit\u2019s okay buddy\u201d. I know buddy isn\u2019t 100% a masculine term but it still made my day.\n\nSometimes I hate being a female but other times I\u2019m just okay with it. Never been happy about being a girl though. I hate having boobs. Seeing them on me makes me feel disgusted. I hate periods because they remind me that I could get pregnant. I know I wouldn\u2019t survive being pregnant. I can just barely handle being female, and with pregnancy being the most feminine thing a woman can do, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. It would disgust me in the same way having boobs and getting a period does, only more severe. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I feel this way strongly enough to transition or not. I can handle being a woman, although I hate it and prefer to be male. It sort of feels like I have to \u201caccept\u201d being a woman rather than just simply be one if that makes sense. Some days I can live without even thinking about wanting to be a male but other days it\u2019s all I can think about. I wish there was a magic button to press to make me male and I would do it in a heart beat, but there isn\u2019t. Even if I can transition it still upsets me that I can never be a cis male, and will have to do a lot of work and spend a lot of money instead of just being born that way.

Please help!!", "text": "So where to start. All through out high school I considered myself a straight guy. I never experienced any physical attraction towards other men and only ever dated cis women. But last year my junior year of high school I met this absolutely beautiful stunning trans man who I immediately hit it off with we were friends for about 3 or 4 months until we finally got together and have been for 9 months now. I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been in my entire life and i love this man with my entire heart. These past 9 months have been the most amazing of my life I\u2019ve never felt such intense love until i met him and I truly think he is the love of my life. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been feeling very anxious, nervous and all around like a shitty person. The reason being that with the end of our high school career rapidly approaching and college being in the very near future. The possibility for him to begin transitioning is finally feasible. I haven\u2019t spoken to him about wether he wants to transition or not because I\u2019m afraid of saying the wrong thing. But I\u2019ve been recently tearing myself up over wether I would still be attracted to him physically if he begins to transition. Like I mentioned I\u2019ve always identified as straight and never felt attraction to cis men. I even recently have tried watching gay porn to see if anything happens arousal wise and unfortunately nothing happens. \n\nSo I guess my questions are is it wrong of me to lose physical attraction to him if he transitions? Is it wrong of me to be dating him in the first place if I can\u2019t seem to be physically attracted to the \u201ctraditional masculine body\u201d? Should I talk to him about this? I\u2019m just so afraid of losing him because I really do love him more than anything in this world and I would be devastated if I lost him. But at the same time I don\u2019t want to not be able to provide for his needs if he transitions and am afraid this means this relationship can\u2019t last.

I always picked boys to play in video games, in kiss chase I always wanted to be the kisser rather than the kissee because I thought it was too girly, I was always king because I don't like being called queen and I never wanted to be the mum when playing families.\n\nFast forward through high school I was still one of the lads, everyone assumed I had no boobs because I wore baggy clothes and just had no interest to show my body off, if anything I was embarrassed of it. I always put myself down because of it. I didn't really question myself in high school as I was comfortable with my friends, but \"girly\" things would make me freak out, I only ever went bra shopping once and it caused me to have a meltdown in the shop. I was 15\ud83d\ude02\n\nThen college came, still happy being myself, college was chill and everyone was more open/accepting/not bothered about what anyone was. I met my now boyfriend and we've been together for almost 4 years. He has always told me how beautiful I am and how much he loves my body and I shouldn't be ashamed of it since day 1, he still does it and is always trying to help me see that I am. \n\nBut the problem is, I don't feel it. Over the past year or so my gender has been popping up in my mind every now and then, especially as I start to think about myself getting older and what I kinda see for myself. For example I'm terrified of giving birth and I don't like the idea of being pregnant, it's too \"gross\" to me, so I always say I don't want kids, when in reality I do, I love kids, I just don't want one from being a girl nor does the idea of being called mum sound appealing to me. \nAnyway these past few weeks these feelings have been a lot more present in my head, I don't know if it's been influenced by People on YouTube, the media etc but they are there and some things they say I relate to. Admittedly there are very rare times I feel confident in my body, but even then I can't refer to my boobs as boobs, they are things. My down there is worse, I literally call it my down there. The thing that triggers me the most is bras, once I've got one I'm like going to wear that every day for fucking ages, until it rips and falls apart, I had never shopped for my own, my mum always dealt with it for me and handed me the plainest ones she found. What really got to me was that my bf brought me a bra, but it was the wrong size... So we went to exchange it and I ended up going in the measuring room, and my god I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life with myself. Honestly I was shaking, back to mirror constantly and to the lady measuring she was so helpful and sweet bless her but I probably came across like right weirdo! Once that whole ordeal was over I freaked out and it put me on edge, I had a proper breakdown once I was alone and I just cried confused at everything. \n\nI don't know. Just the idea of me maybe not being a girl is scary. I still can't stand being called a lady, or woman or mum (to my pet). I am really uncomfortable with my body about 96% of the time. I just try not to think about any of it and tell myself it's me being silly or I'm just having a blip with my head and stuff. The more I think about it the more it starts to make sense, but it might be cos I'm thinking about it so much that I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm a boy?! Or what if it's just I really have no body confidence?? It's such a big thing to think about and it scares the shit out of me, these thoughts could just be temporary but what if they're not? Like I'm scared of how I'd go about it, how it would effect my relationship and how my family would react (I know how they each would already though)\n\nIt's just a scary thing and sorry I think I needed to type and release this to someone. Thanks for reading, if you have any advice for my confused self then I'm all ears! \n\nOh and just a note, I spoke to my bf about it after my major bra store freakout, he was really supportive and was absolutely devastatingly sorry over how I felt, he felt like it was his fault when it really wasn't. \n", "date": "2018-12-19 00:12:35", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a7gyvt/starting_to_question_my_gender_and_it_scares_the/", "author": "mysilentsecrets"}, {"title": "Hi there!! \ud83e\udd6f\ud83c\udf5e", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-19 02:27:01", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a7i3k2/hi_there/", "author": "nategam"}, {"title": "Questioning my new name", "text": "A few months ago I settled on the name Ayesha, and I really liked the choice when I made it.

If this is okay with you guys, how would you defend yourselves from this post? I'll credit you guys for your arguments.\n\nTRANSGENDERISM, BASED ON WHAT? \nBy: Pastor Manny\n\nNote: I will just post the note here since some people comment without reading the whole post from the beginning to end. I don\u2019t hate people who are part of LGBTQQIP2SAA because I have some friends and family members who are part of it. Hopefully, if you are going to comment, you will address with the arguments that I presented rather than just saying, \u201cOh, you\u2019re judgmental, I don\u2019t care about your arguments\u201d, etc. That is close-mindedness. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor some people who are unaware, a transgender is a person whose gender identity differs from the sex that the person had at birth [1]. We often hear some statements from them such as, \u201cI am a man born in the woman\u2019s body\u201d or vice versa. In this article, I will be presenting whether transgenderism is right or wrong, ordered or disordered, natural or unnatural using science, logic, and Scriptures as my basis. \n.\n\nBASED ON SCIENCE:\nSome, if not all, transgender people claim that they were born this way. They claim that having a gender identity that is different from the assigned sex is natural. However, this is a scientific claim, and when these claims are made, we have to consider some studies whether this is backed up by science. \n\n.\n\nJust this year, a recent study on transgender teens was censored by Brown University because pro-LGBT group pressured the university to delete the study just five days after its publication [2]. You might be wondering about the content of this said study and the reason why pro-LGBT wanted to delete this research. \n\n.\n\nIn this study, it was stated that 86.7% of those who were surveyed and came out as transgender were peer pressured and had social influence from friends or social media that supports transgenderism [3]. This goes against the common view that it\u2019s genetic because the majority came out not from internal causes but from external causes. Even if their claim is true about transgenderism being genetic, I don\u2019t think that it is comfortable for them to say it because, in the same study, about 62.5% were diagnosed to have at least one mental health disorder [3]. I am not saying it without basis. Rather, I am simply stating the results of the said study. \n\n.\n\nBASED ON LOGIC:\nWhen we are using logic, one way of addressing this is by looking at the consistency of the reasoning behind transgenderism and to test that consistency, we can use other examples where similar reasoning is applied. One similar case to TRANSGENDERISM is TRANSABILITY. According to Alexandra Basil, a Ph.D. in Women\u2019s Studies who is also a transgender, \u201cWe define transability as the desire or the need for a person identified as able-bodied by other people to transform his or her body to obtain a physical impairment [4].\u201d So, if you\u2019ve met someone who is transabled, that person is someone who is not disabled, but he or she identifies as disabled and as such, he wanted to disable himself or herself just to be disabled. Just as we don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for us to tolerate TRANSABILITY, we should also not tolerate TRANSGENDERISM.\n\n.\n\nHowever, some transgender claim that this is not a good comparison, and they even call transabled people as \u201cdishonest people\u201d [4]. However, I don\u2019t see why this is not a good comparison especially when the transgender identify themselves as a woman (for example) even though his sexuality is a man physically speaking just as how the transabled identify themselves as disabled even though physically, they are not disabled. There is similarity because of the reasoning of the transgender that identity matters more than physicality. According to Boredom Therapy, \u201cThese people feel like imposters in their own bodies, all because they are naturally in perfect health [5]\u201d. Well, that sounds familiar to me. \n\n.\n\nAt the same time, I realized that there is inconsistency in the reasoning behind transgenderism. Below, I will be providing two hypothetical statements that reflect this ideology. \n\n.\n\nStatement 1: My gender identity is not based on my physicality. \n\n.\n\nStatement 2: Therefore, I will change my physicality to be similar to my gender identity. \n\n.\n\nIf statement 1 is true, then there is no connection between gender identity and the physical body. However, why do transgender people wanted to change their body if there is no connection between their gender identity and their body? This is a clear contradiction, and this simply reflects the fact that there is a connection with \u201cwho we are\u201d and \u201cwhat our body is\u201d. \n\n.\n\nBASED ON SCRIPTURES:\nI will be providing a passage in Scriptures that is relevant to the issue I raised here. \n\n.\n\nRomans 1:26-27 \n\n26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. Their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural, 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in their own persons the due penalty for their error.\n\n.\n\nIt is important to note that in Romans 1, it describes women and men biologically because these words were used in the context of sex. Another indication why this is the case is because \u201cnatural relations\u201d are used to denote that man and woman are titles that denote to our human nature and not a social construct or what. It\u2019s important to consider this passage as well because even if a transgender man claim that he\u2019s a woman inside, he cannot deny that his sex is male or that he is biologically male. This is the same reason why they claim that they are born in the wrong body given that they recognize that their body is not the same as what they think they are. Given that Romans 1 shows that the sexual relationship between two biologically males is wrong, even if they claim that they are women inside, they are still biologically males and as such, they are under the category that the Bible provided. \n\n.\n\nEven though we know someone, probably a friend or a family member, who is part of transgenderism, it doesn\u2019t mean that we have to approve of what they are doing just because we don\u2019t want to offend them. Morality is based on facts, not on feelings. We just cannot argue based on our emotion because even the Bible says that \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately corrupt; who can understand it?\u201d (Jeremiah 17:9). With this, I will end this article with a verse whether we should approve of it or not. \n\n.\n\nRomans 1:32 \n32 Though they know God\u2019s decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only do them but approve those who practice them.\n.\n\nReferences:\n[1] https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transgender\n[2] https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/researcher-defends-study-showing-teens-being-pressured-into-transgenderism\n[3] https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0202330\n[4] https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/becoming-disabled-by-choice-not-chance-transabled-people-feel-like-impostors-in-their-fully-working-bodies\n[5] http://boredomtherapy.com/transabled-people/\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nFirstly, I am sorry for using 'transgenderism'.

And it scares the shit out of me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, recently I've found myself questioning my gender, and in general that part hasn't been too traumatic. I live in an extremely open community and my friends and family are all very accepting, not that I've talked to any of them yet. I came out as bi the summer of 2017, and coming to terms with myself about that was much worse than considering the fact that I may be female. Yet I can't help but feel that this is coming at the worst time. I was finally having a bit of a reprieve from my typical depression, but this has hit me like a truck, even though it doesn't always feel that way. The idea that I could be trans has just been one of those things. Several of my friends are trans and they're always pretty open about their experiences, but being transgender has kinda been one of those things that, ya know, other people are, not something that I am. And yet I can't fucking shake this feeling that I'm a girl. I mean, if I look back at some stuff there are things that could definitely be seen as signs, but then I'm afraid that that's just confirmation bias. Meanwhile I keep switching back and forth between \"give yourself some more time to think about and consider this\" and \"You're a girl, duh\". I mean, it's not uncommon that I find myself getting really stuck in an idea for a bit of time before dropping it like a rock, so I'm wary of doing anything too quickly, and then there's that voice in my head that says I'm just trying to get attention and be unique. That voice is, of course, saying the exact same shitty stuff I told myself when I was coming out as bi and when I was starting to talk about my depression, but it's just got such a way of sticking. On the other hand I've found myself scrolling through names looking for ones that fit me and calling myself she in private, and goddamn, I'm not sure how to describe how it feels, but its certainly a unique emotion and its certainly not bad. So I'm really conflicted on what the hell is going on in my head right now, which isn't exactly abnormal either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAll the while I'm finishing up school before the holiday break and I just can't focus. I find myself browsing this sub and others like r/MtF, loving what I'm seeing. There's the strangest sensation in my chest at all times. Its the same kind of area and pressure that I feel during my worse depressive episodes, but it doesn't feel stifling or like my depression at all. It feels like the worst case of the butterflies I've ever had, like the first time I ever performed in front of a crowd when I was all of eight years old. It makes it hard to breath or pay attention, but at the same time it feels fucking invigorating! Like i could run a marathon without breaking stride. But then when I begin to consider things like presenting female, or changing my names and pronouns I get, once again, fucking terrified. I'm already going through so much right now and making it through by the skin of my teeth, I don't think I can take on a change like that right now in my life, or maybe even ever. And then there's the thoughts about transitioning, and those depress me to all hell and back. I'm a broad-shouldered, 6 foot, deep-voiced, hairy guy; the chances of me ever passing are awful. I've already got enough body issues with my current one, and I'm afraid of adding anything else on there. Not to mention the fact that I doubt my dad would want to have anything to do with a medical transition. He doesn't even want me taking meds for my depression, and I've yet to come out to him as bi either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sure a lot of this is pretty typical shit that people go through when discovering their gender-identity, but goddamn does it terrify me. I'm trying to build up the courage to talk to a friend about it, and this is the closest I can get to a safe-space right now besides my friends as I'm not gonna be able to see my therapist until freakin January 8th. I'm sorry for the rant everyone, any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm shaking like a leaf right now, I've never had issues with anxiety, but this is how I imagine it feels.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "2018-12-20 21:56:48", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a8302n/help_please_confused_as_hell/", "author": "confused121718"}, {"title": "Any advice for Christmas Family partys?", "text": "I love Christmas but at the same time I dread it.

To clarify my sexuality here, I believe I'm pansexual, leaning strongly towards attraction to females.\n- I've had some trauma as a child (nothing physical)\n- I've had mental health issues most of my life, including strong anxiety, ocd, depression, (95% healed after years of work now. Never give up folks. Woop!)\n- I don't have extreme gender dysphoria, but then again I don't have a strong connection to my body at all, especially with the aformentioned pelvic floor tension (working on it!)\n- For those that know or care about mbti - and this is probably irrelevant - I'm INFJ.\n- I don't hate my body, I just don't connect to it well.\n- There's a lot about being a man that's enjoyable, but something just doesn't feel complete.\n- I'm a 'problem solver' when trying to help people, so sometimes I come across as less empathetic (or stereotypically 'female') than I feel. I just value helping people in conjunction with listening, as opposed to just listening and doing nothing. Life's precious, and I believe problems should be solved and not left to stagnate.\n- I find it hard to understand my true gender as I see myself as different from most of both genders. Society's full of toxic masculinity and femininity, so finding 'balanced' people to view as archetypes of their gender (or even understanding what that looks like) is a little challenging.\n- People I relate to in fiction (I'm scraping the barrel, but the more info to help you help me, the better): Sabrina Spellman, Daenerys, Jon Snow, Mitsuha (the Your Name girl), Neo (yes, I know the trans allegory).\n\n\n\nSo... penny for your thoughts?\nI'm only looking for opinions here as I'm just at the stage of consciously exploring my gender identity, I have no firm beliefs or plans or ideas, but I feel it's important to speak about this and get feedback from others who may be able to help piece things together.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n\n", "date": "2018-12-23 05:40:39", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a8s9zo/are_these_signs_im_transgender/", "author": "000_Violet_000"}, {"title": "Why are so many trans people racist?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-12-23 12:10:45", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/a8u7th/why_are_so_many_trans_people_racist/", "author": "the_curiosity_94"}, {"title": "Things you found helpful from friends/partners", "text": "So I an a Cis woman married to a trans women, she is about to start HRT and wants me to help her with makeup in the near future, and I was wondering if there were any other things any of you found helpful to have a partner show you that my wife or I might not just have thought of?

I would wish for it all the time.\n\nAs I aged, I accepted that it just wasn\u2019t possible. I\u2019d heard of \u201csex change operations\u201d but back in the 80s, that was both semi-mythical and scary and out of the realm of my reality.\n\nAs I aged, being the nerd I am, I found myself regularly rolling female characters in D&amp;D, and once I started playing online games, I started looking how to change my voice too so people wouldn\u2019t assume I was just some dude playing a girl online. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m now 42. I\u2019m married with a few young kids.

I dont even know anymore.", "text": "Hi! This is my first post with this new account (and kind of my first reddit post entirely even though this isn't my main account) because I don't want anyone who knows me to see this. \nAnyway I came here to pretty much explain my entire story in as little text as possible so we'll see how that goes. I just need to get the whole thing off my chest because it's been tough. Some of the basic knowledge that's important is that I'm 16 (currently in 11th grade), and I have a younger sister in 8th grade, and an older brother in his freshman year of college. Hope you enjoy what I kind of just barfed into this post. I just really needed to get all of this off my chest. (SORRY FOR ANY GRAMMAR OR SPELLING MISTAKES. TYPED ON MY PHONE AND IT'S 4 IN THE MORNING. Also sorry if I bore you with some of the more unimportant details)\n\nOk (also I don't exactly have the best wording for explaining some things soooooo yeah). I was born biologically male, but ever since I was little there were moments where I really just didn't feel like I was. Where I felt more like I was a girl. My first memory of doing anything related to that was being a small child and trying to get my little sister to leave the play room so I could try on a skirt and then I took it off so I wouldn't get caught. While these thoughts were present when I was very young, after years of being forced into sports and my older brother constantly forcing me to be tougher and all that jazz, my young mind pushed all of these thoughts behind me. It didn't stop them from existing though. I just continued to suppress them because I didn't even know what \"transgender\" was or that it even existed at the time. Fast forward a few years to my middle school years. My family moved from Long Island, NY to North Carolina. Not much happened except standard saying goodbye to friends and stuff, but as soon as I started school there and made my one friend, I started questioning my sexuality (It wouldn't be until 9th grade that I accepted [not fully because God forbid I accept who I am] that I'm bi, but I'm still closeted about that to this day). Then around the second half of my 8th grade year I started questioning my gender (Worst possible time probably because I live in North Carolina and it was 2016, and the anti-sjw YouTube channels were on the rise and some just started saying some rather homophobic stuff and it was quite the issue). It would kind of go on and off because I would try to accept it and then force myself to be like \"No. You are a male,\" but it would still just keep coming back. After my torturous 8th grade year finished (incredibly bad teacher and annoying students) I went into the summer and got into a long distance relationship with a girl. It lasted about 3+ weeks maybe (still friends to this day tho :] ), but I just wasn't cut out for it and my constant questioning of my gender and sexuality didn't help. When I entered my 9th grade year I ended up getting bullied by someone who was my friend the previous year and with that experience adding up with the bad experience from the last year it sent me to a dark place and I was soon pulled out of the public school system and homeschooled. While I was being homeschooled it gave me a lot more time to think about my gender, as trying to think about it in the constantly hostile environment I felt like I was in with the public school didn't do much. That didn't do much either as my feelings kept going up and down as I would go from saying \"yes, I am trans,\" to \"no, I am not trans now get out of my head.\" I did do a bit more research at some points though (not a lot, but some) and the idea of coming out and having to see a gender therapist or joining online communities was overwhelming (that stays true to today, but I promise I'll get to that later :3). Anyway, after my ninth grade year ended I went into my 10th grade year going to a small private school. Over the course of the first half of the year I thought about whether or not I was trans. In December I finally accepted that I was, but now I had to figure out how to come out. I decided that I would come out to my younger sister first because we have pretty much been best friends since my sister was born. Now of all the times my family members claimed they were accepting (never directly speaking to each other), I got the exact opposite direction. My sister first took it as \"wow, ok... Uh cool I guess,\" but the next day she was *probably* deliberately saying stuff like \"I love having two brothers\" and all that stuff even though I had literally came out to her as a trans girl the day before. I confronted her later and she said something like \"you know I'll love you no matter what.\" I left it off there. The next day though when we went out to walk our dog we sat down on some swings at our neighborhood park for a quick break and we started talking about it. She then proceeded to tell me how she had typed out a whole long text telling me to get my shite together and get out of this \"phase\" of thinking something I may not be before I make any mistakes. I was livid, but now I was afraid again and suppressed my acceptance of who I thought I was. I haven't brought it up to her since then. After that, I thought maybe finishing the more significant parts of puberty, like my voice deepening, I would \"become the man I was supposed to be.\" That didn't happen (also as of recent my sister has no trouble accepting her lgbtq+ friends, which is kind of strange because that seemed to be a problem with me, but it also makes sense because they're her friends and she sees them less but also has a ton of fun with them and I'm her sibling and I've lived with her my whole life, and I guess it was strange to her but whatever). I'm now half way through my 11th grade year and I'm still questioning my gender. I have since come out to my therapist for my mental health about my questioning of gender, but no more. Reading back on this and thinking about all my experiences it makes me just want to accept it and be who I feel I truly am, but at the same time I don't 100% feel that way. I can't tell if that's mostly because I fear what will happen if I do though. My brother came home from his first semester of college and randomly started making fun of trans people and people who identify outside the genders of male and female. It scares me since I'm currently actively trying to find who I truly feel I am, but that's not the only thing. One of my parents favorite stories to tell is how fortune tellers predicted they would have two boys and a girl, and that's exactly what happened and I'm afraid of \"ruining\" that I guess. Also my parents can be more close minded than they claim to be sometimes and my mom asks a thousand questions and then asks a thousand more based on each individual question. Also my grandmothers (one grandfather died when I was very very young, and never met the other one) are extremelymely old fashioned. One is a cold hard conservative, but I will give her this. It's simple that I feel like she loves us unconditionally. The other grew up in Germany with strict old fashioned values. Also my step grandfather has pretty much chosen ME as the grandchild he will pass all the life lessons he learned down to. Also I'm afraid of telling my friends, and I'm afraid of doing it now because I'm still a student in highschool. These are probably the most basic things that you all either had to or have to deal with, but I'm new to most of this still, and could probably use some guidance. The most I've stepped into living as a female to see what it's like was putting on female clothing (it did feel liberating honestly). I'm just scared of getting caught doing anything and then having to explain myself. I still second guess myself whenever I try to come to any sort of definite conclusion. That's all I have I think. Now let me build the courage to actually post this and if anyone sees this and comments I'll have to build up the courage to read it because I'm a nervous child. Ok bai.

I hate it. I want my physical masculinity aesthetically gone now.\n\nThe issue here is that I'm pretty certain my family won't be very accepting of this, or might not even understand and this potential disapproval might hinder me from getting any sort of help, and on top of that my girlfriend will probably have to leave me due to her sexuality as she has mentioned to me before when I have brought this topic up.\n\nAs with most people, my biggest worry is that I won't come out of the transition feeling as if my body is that of a female and that I won't be able to shape myself up to be the ideal self I've always wanted to be.\n\nFor the record, I'm 17 and from the UK.

I said they're not accepting a social construct of the gender binary being framed as an objective/biological truth. My friend rebutted that, if a trans person wants to get sex reassignment surgery, then it means that it's their sex that they want to change and not their gender. I couldn't think of a good response to that. \n\nHis overall point seems to be: if gender is just a social construct, then why do trans people who want surgery want to change their physical genitalia instead of only their gender presentation?\n\nIn retrospect, a good rebuttal might have been to say that trans people who want surgery want it because the genitalia they have is a part of their gender presentation that is important to them. I guess I don't know if that's actually why trans people want the surgery, though. \n\nAnyway, can anyone share any good articles or videos or information that could help me argue against the aforementioned argument, against the \"biological sex is a binary\" argument, and against the \"why is transgender valid but transracial is not\" argument?

Weird feelings when looking in the mirror commence, also feel that this is normal and everyone has this.\n\n\u2022 Self care totally non existent.\n\n\u2022 Hated shopping for my own clothes.

Think every male feels this way.\n\n\u2022 Begin envisioning myself as the female in any type of explicit content I watch.\n\n\u2022 Junior year begin disassociating for full days at least a few times a week. Didn't know what to make of this but didn't mind it either?\n\n\u2022 Also begin crying endlessly after work at the empty mall parking lot in my car at least three times a week.

Decide I'm not manly enough and start working out fervently as well as eating an insane amount to build muscle.\n\n\u2022 Basically have the perfect male body and it's even worse. Quit. Don't analyze it at all.\n\n\u2022 Move in with current fiance, talk about their trans bro and become more open to the topic.\n\n\u2022 Research Research.

I feel like shouting some frustrations into the digital-void for a bit, hope you don't mind.\n\nI'm visiting my parents for the holidays and my brother decided he wanted to clean out a closet with things from the kids' childhoods. So I spent a couple hours reading through papers and digging up memories that I didn't know I still had from elementary school (about 10 years old). The thing is, in these papers I show every indication of being a stereotypical boy interested in stereotypical boy things. My notebook was full of crude drawings of planes shooting each other and blowing up, stick figure armies at war with poorly drawn guns and trails of dots and dashes to represent the paths of bullets. Hey, don't judge the macabre topics. I was 10 and it was 1990s USA where things like G.I. Joe were marketed straight at me.\n\n(tangentially, i'm also increasingly convinced from reading these papers that I had some level of attention deficit as a child, something I've suspected for a while)\n\nBut sitting here now in a dress, having realized suddenly in my 30s that I want to be a woman and that I have wanted that for a very very long time, it really hurts to see how 'boy' I was back then. It hurts to see how neatly I used to fit into a stereotypical mold that I'm actively rejecting today.\n\nI know intellectually that not 'knowing I was trans since I was 4' is fine, that the standard trans narrative was mostly created for cis people, and that the narrative is quite harmful to anyone who didn't have that experience. I guess i'm demonstrating why it's harmful right now. I've made that argument for others who are struggling with impostor feelings so many times. But still, it bothers me. It seems almost silly to be upset by not finding signs of gender issues in a 4th grade scratch-pad. But somehow it still hurts, like intellectual arguments can only get you so far.\n\nI have one or two other gender non-conforming memories or stories from pre-puberty childhood that I cling to. 'Evidence' that I'm trans that I intellectually don't think I should need, but secretly still bring me some small comfort and so I still cling to.\n\nI deeply want to be a girl, and to make that happen I *need to* be trans.

I thought I'd share how I got here, where I hope to get to and the struggles along the way.\n\nI am a 46 year old woman who has had male genitals for that time. Like most I didn't understand why I wasn't like other people, and went the tried and trusted route of being a hermit.\n\nAvoiding relationships was an easy way to avoid having to ask difficult questions. Like many transgender people I 'learnt' to act and speak male, but never got in. Being made bisexual in attraction pushed me to being asexual in person due to confusion.\n\nFeb this year I finally faced up to the fact I have a life and should actually live it. I was convinced for the first time I was worth the effort. So after having toyed with the idea on and off since I found becoming feminine was possible (basically the last 30 years) I decided enough was enough.\n\nJust telling people was such a huge relief. Most of my friends reactions were positive (from \"I'm shocked exactly how unshocked I am you are doing that\" to \"Oh, you finally worked it out - took you long enough\"). By June I was willing to talk about it to a doctor.\n\nSince then I have been on a waiting list (they tell me it's around a year) and have told all my friends, my dad (he is old school, it's hard on him but he said \"I don't understand but I guess I don't need to. I'd rather you didn't but if it's what you need I'll support you 100%\"\n\nI've been on antidepressants for over 20 years and for the first time, since accepting me for me, I am having good results with lower doses. Work know, several colleagues know, and I am anxious for the day I can tell everyone.\n\nIn fairness I have to say I am still in a process. I have certain goals to reach before starting any medication or considering surgery. I have always been overweight, it is partly from the depression and also because it hides the breasts. Mind you, I like them and they are all I currently intend to keep.\n\nMy plan is to get to 100kg (a loss of 50Kg) and stay like that for a few months to see has that alone affects my mood and self image. I am at 125 currently after putting some on over Christmas, so hope to be at that weight by March/April. This gives me 2 months to hold the weight and take stock.\n\nIt was a cautious approach, I admit, but fits with the timelines on being seen by a clinic here in England. I am a little unnerved by how quickly I went from it being an idea to an active plan (one conversation - the first time I admitted I was seriously thinking it about it - and it was suddenly a reality I was pursuing)\n\nI started thinking I'll take it very slow, take no long term decisions until I 'have' to and I won't switch until I am convinced I can pass. Now I can't wait to tell people, to finally be on the outside who I am on the inside, to not feel I have to hide myself from everyone but be honest about how I feel and what I like.\n\nWish me luck! \n\n", "date": "2018-12-30 20:39:06", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/aazk0b/starting_the_journey/", "author": "GodEmpressGabby"}, {"title": "I'm thinking of using my femme voice as much as i can in normal situations, but I'm in the closet and thinking it might be a bit shitty for other people.", "text": "So like my normal voice is in the androgynous range and I'm trying to do a resonance thingy without changing pitch too much and it sounds pretty ok for now, i gender it female and its not too far from my normal voice, qnd using it around my friend that im out to she didn't notice me doing it haha.\n\nSo I'm thinking maybe when i build up enough stamina to just use that most the time, but I'm in tue closet, and this poses a moral question for me.

It was quite difficult to even write that, it's oddly more easy than otherwise given the dissociation/derealisation though.

My celebrity crush asked me out kinda and I need advice.", "text": "Hi there!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOkay, so first up about me - I am a 29 year old trans girl from Canada. I have used Reddit before but it's been forever and my old account was under my old name.\n\nI will start as well by mentioning this isn't meant to offend anyone, it's my opinion and I don't want to come across as having any wrong opinions to offend anyone in particular. I am in need of some real solid advice so please help! &lt;3\n\nI won't say who it is exactly, but I am in a group in Facebook that apparently he was in too. He left a message under my comment saying basically \"message me we should go on a date if you're a real girl\".\n\nNow some things I want to be clear about:\n\n\\- I am not interested in taking that personally or doing anything about him being transphobic. If it's to do with dating, you're into what you're into and I wouldn't hold that against him. \n\n\\- I need to find the best way to approach this with a positive outcome. If we click then like omg.\n\n\\- Thank you in advance for any help you are willing to share. :)\n\n\\- I am pretty resilient and prepared for this to bomb completely but am hoping for the best.\n\n\\- I treat people like people should be treated, celebrity or not so I will only be a bit starstruck at first but can be a real person around them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo my dilemma:\n\nI have to message him tonight or tomorrow and I feel like I need to address the very first thing he says to me - basically if I am a \"real girl\" or not. I know I am a real girl, always have been on the inside, and am a few months away from my GRS surgery. I have been on HRT for about a year an a half and already have a C cup. I am passable and have friends I know that have no idea about it.\n\nSo I need an approach and to kind of prepare to answer the questions properly. I am confident and can carry my conversation well generally - but I need to know:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA.) What should I say at first? Should I joke and poke fun at it, or ignore it completely and get to know him for a bit longer before I mention anything? I wouldn't want to deceive or hide it in any way, so just never saying a word doesn't seem like an option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nB.) If he does ask about it, how should I tell him for the best possible outcome? I know I have nice pics I can send (I wish I had boudoir photos but oh well) and I can connect to peoples personalities well generally do okay with that. I can say, yes I am trans, but I feel like I need to blurt out - but my surgery is soon! I can to try to make it no big deal, but who tf just announces what their genitals are to their celebrity crush who thinks you're cute. It's a far leap from hello and it's difficult to find a nice way to put it naturally in a conversation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate any and all positive insight and anything that can add constructive advice for me. I will try to update as I go.\n\nPlease, again, be nice in the comments to me, the subject and other commenters.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you!!!", "date": "2018-12-31 08:46:30", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/ab5fpl/i_need_some_dating_help_my_celebrity_crush_asked/", "author": "kitticallyxd"}, {"title": "How much effort do you think this would be?

The thing is, I don't have that definitive feeling of rejecting my gender that lots of trans people talk about in their stories, where from the very start they hated their gender. I didn't grow up hating toys meant for boys, I love playing video games, and even if I did undergo HRT I still want to keep my old hobbies. I didn't even really feel the urge to wear a dress until around middle school. I just feel conflicted and on the fence. I want to wear dresses and makeup, but I'm also fine with wearing shorts and a t-shirt. I still want to sing low even as a woman, and I don't embody a lot of female mannerisms in my daily life. I'm attracted to lesbians, and whenever I see a couple I fantasize about being the woman at their side. In my dreams  I've always pictured myself as a woman with another woman, instead of a man and a woman. The reason I'm so bothered right now is that I read that the later you start HRT the lower your chances of passing are, so as a result the pressure to make a decision before it's too late is part of why I'm so stressed. The problem is that I've never actually spent any time as a woman, aside from a bit of cross dressing in private, so I'm afraid that doctors will reject me for not being serious about transitioning. But my family is really against this kind of thing, and since I commute instead of dorming, I haven't had any opportunities to try and experience life as a woman. I know that choosing to undergo HRT is a serious and life changing decision, so it annoys me that I have no way to test out whether or not being a woman is right for me.  The other thing bothering me is that I gaze into the mirror and imagine what I would've looked like as a woman, but  in my head I'm worried that if I undergo HRT I won't look like the woman I envisioned myself being. I'm hesitant because I've always wanted to be a biological woman, and I'm afraid that if I undergo trans therapy I won't be satisfied with the result. Not to mention how difficult it'll be to come out to my parents, who are very against this kind of thing, and the cost of HRT and clothes and makeup, and all the other problems that will arise with this kind of decision. Overall I'm feeling depressed and frustrated and  honestly I wish I was dead so I don't have to have this argument in my head anymore. I wish I was born a girl so I wouldn't be stressed out with all of these frustrating feelings and thoughts.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso I'm sorta posting these on all the trans subreddits just to hear their thoughts, sorry if that violates a rule or seems like spam.", "date": "2018-12-31 20:20:47", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/abauej/conflicting_thoughts/", "author": "Wilhiem1"}, {"title": "Get raped tranny faggots", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2018-12-31 21:08:02", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/abb9w5/get_raped_tranny_faggots/", "author": "Toastbro666"}, {"title": "\u2764\ufe0eHAPPY NEW YEAR\u2764\ufe0e May your dreams come true!", "text": "", "date": "2018-12-31 21:47:41", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/abbmkz/happy_new_year_may_your_dreams_come_true/", "author": "CallaMouah"}, {"title": "Horrible coming out", "text": "Hey guys so I'm a mtf trans but I haven't even started HRT.
