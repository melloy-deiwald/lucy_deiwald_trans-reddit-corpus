Personally, I suspect my friend is not an actual trans person - if there is such a thing as autogynephilia, that is him.  But I fear I'm getting ahead of myself here.\n\nI have read all sorts of literature.  I am familiar with the Blanchard typologies, and subscribe to [Rod Fleming on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBITj9g0q1Q).  I have, for a couple years now, followed the RadFem/GenderCritical communities, and understand their specific complaints.  I spend quite a lot of time on /r/changemyview debating on the actual science behind transsexuality - most specifically the differences in underlying brain structure, etc.\n\nAt some point, I had come to the conclusion that \"transsexual\" and \"transgender\" were two different things.  I defined transsexual as someone who has Gender Dysphoria, and intends to, or has undergone medical transition - which is specifically NOT limited to hormone therapy - my suspicion is trans people are likely to seek actual gender reassignment surgery.  I also suspect that there are very likely biological markers that could be used to identify someone who is transsexual.\n\nThat leads me to my title: I am gatekeeping.  I only just recently heard the terms \"transmedicalist\" and \"truscum\", which is what has led me here.  You are also \"gatekeeping\", or as I see it, ensuring that people who consider themselves \"transgender\" are not appropriating terminology for your actual condition.\n\nSo now that I'm here, and you know a little bit about me, I was wondering if you might help me better understand your position.\n\nFor instance, do you folks subscribe to the Blanchard typologies?  Specifically: autogynephilic (AGP) males are people who fetishize about themselves as females, and are sexually aroused of the thought of themselves having, e.g., female genitalia; and homosexual transsexuals (HSTS), who are male and androphilic, or female and gynephilic, and who seek to fulfill the role associated with their sexuality (MtF seek to be penetrated; FtM seek to penetrate).\n\nI have had a little trouble grasping the Blanchard typologies fully.  I suspect there certainly are AGPs that are not actual transsexuals, and are fetishists - but I'm not sure if HSTS is a complete picture of actual transsexuals.  Rod Fleming, who is not a scientists, but a journalist IIRC, has refined those definitions as above, and has basically stated (in the link I provided to him) that transsexuality is just that: someone who's gender identity is indicative of their sexuality, and their sexuality is that of the opposite sex; so therefore a MtF must be homosexual (androphilic), and seek to fulfill the female sex role.  Again, I've had trouble with this, but some of the research, specifically into the fractional anisotropy of white matter in various brain regions, has shown a clear linear pattern that shows the mean FA for heterosexual males being highest, followed by homosexual males, followed by MtF, followed by FtM, followed by homosexual women, followed by heterosexual women.  So it seems logical that someone who is MtF is just more so sexually orientated toward the female side of the house than even homosexual men.\n\nThat said, not being trans, it works for me to use those classifications - but I'm not sure if its actually related to the lived experienced.  So with that said, I came to ask you folks, as, you seem to share my views on gatekeeping, what your opinions are, and to gain a better understanding here.\n\nDisclaimer:  I hope this is not offensive to you.  I suspect you lot are not quite as quick to jump to SJW tactics like the trenders seem to be, so I suspect my inquiry is not offensive, but thought I would throw that in there.

Someone who has the mutual understanding that I\u2019m just another human being, they know I\u2019m trans, and it\u2019s not a big deal to them, so I\u2019m treated just as any cis person would be. This is litterally textbook definition of what acceptance is, and anyone who wants anything else and claims that they want acceptance doesn\u2019t understand this. I look cis, I sound cis, I act cis. I basically am cis, people who have known me for years are still surprised when I tell them that I\u2019m trans. Of course I\u2019d tell my roommate beforehand that I\u2019m trans, and if it was a problem, I would just share a room with someone else. Ideally the college would have a checkbox \u201cwould you be ok if you had a transgender roommate\u201d Gender Inclusive housing is still an option, but it\u2019s exactly that, optional. There\u2019s a lot of people in my college, I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s a least one person in my school who doesn\u2019t care that I\u2019m trans.\n\nHonestly I\u2019m so grateful that I pass, it\u2019s a blessing, but honestly it\u2019s all made me realize that I\u2019m really sick of having this transgender label always slapped around at me, preventing me from doing otherwise normal things that any normal girl would do without a problem. I shouldn\u2019t have to be sent off to another dorm because I just so happened to be born in the wrong body, it\u2019s not something I can control, and besides the fact that I\u2019m trans, I\u2019m no different than any other cis girl. I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so hard for people to understand that people who are litterally afraid of their own genitals aren\u2019t gonna cause any problems. It\u2019s an unwarranted fear, and I\u2019d honestly be more concerned about gay people sexually assaulting their roommates, I mean, don\u2019t we separate male and female students specifically to prevent that sort of thing? Plus, the person assaulted probably wouldn\u2019t come out about it 1. Out of fear of their manhood 2. Because people don\u2019t like to see anyone that\u2019s gay put in any sort bad of light, as it could be misinterpreted as \u201cgay people are bad\u201d so people generally don\u2019t like to believe that a gay person could do that, when in reality they\u2019re no different from straight people other than the fact that they like different people. The worst transphobia I\u2019ve ever seen was in the LGBT community. Straight people typically just don\u2019t care that much one way or another. Everyone I know surprisingly didn\u2019t care except one family member who\u2019s religious, and tried to convince me to \u201cstay the way god made me\u201d in a pretty respectful manner. Of course, I never chose to be trans, I\u2019ve always just been a girl, and he\u2019s misguided, but at least he means well by it. If I wasn\u2019t trans I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d believe. It was far more tame compared to what the worst of the LGB people have said to me, he wasn\u2019t a bad person.\n\nAnyway, My college is going to tell me that I need to \u201crequest\u201d (if they\u2019re making me do it then it\u2019s not a request, they just use nicer language to try to get everyone on their side) \u201cgender inclusive housing\u201d and they disguise their transphobia as \u201cgender inclusive\u201d to trick people into falling for it, because they want trans people to think \u201coh wow the school is offering me housing where I can feel safe!\u201d You\u2019d feel perfectly safe with a cis person who accepted you, they simply want the cis people to feel safe from a non-threat, and they don\u2019t want to deal with the \u201cburden\u201d of having to plan out where each individual trans people would go based on who will accept them, it\u2019s just much easier to be like \u201clet\u2019s just have all the trans people live here, because acceptance!\u201d\n\nAnd they think that that\u2019s a perfect solution. It\u2019s not. This whole thing, even if it\u2019s probably not intentional, is manipulative, and I hate it. And as a way to deflect attention from all of this, the school\u2019s almost rave about how great gay people are, and what they do to support them they practically ignore trans issues unless they absolutely have to talk about it. That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating about having trans forced into this \u201cspectrum\u201d of people who respectfully have nothing to do with us. Trans people deserves our own movement away from the LGBQ community. I\u2019ve seen all of this happen time and time again and no one ever speaks up about it or says anything about it. Having us under an umbrella is an attempt to lessen us, and they want to sneakily silence us again by trying to convince us that non-binary people are also transgender (which they respectfully aren\u2019t, they\u2019re their own thing, I\u2019m not here to claim that I know if it\u2019s a real thing or not, all I know is that whatever it is, it\u2019s not trans.) and when we try to explain all of this to them, we\u2019re told that it\u2019s \u201cwrong\u201d to ask for a word like transsexual that properly distinguishes transgender and non binary people from each other. We\u2019re told that the word is offensive and \u201coutdated\u201d. I\u2019m 18 years old, before Caitlyn Jenner happened (I came out in 2014, thank god.) Transsexual was still a pretty commonplace term. Back then basically no one knew that being trans was even a thing, and despite the media portraying us like a joke, there wasn\u2019t a bunch of public hate towards us, and you could talk to someone irl about it and they\u2019d usually treat you like a normal person.\n\nSadly transgender is the term everyone already knows and is farmiliar with though, and this whole \u201cnon binary trans\u201d BS is thankfully pretty rare at this point in time (which is why we need to stop it NOW). but in my personal life I would much, much prefer to be called transsexual. I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with \u201cSexualizing it\u201d when it\u2019s literally a term that describes to someone changing their sex\n\nNOBODY calls themselves binary transgender in the real world outside of the LGBTQIA+ cult, it\u2019s absolutely absurd. They don\u2019t want us to have a voice, because trans people are literally the most normal people in the whole LGBTQIA+ politically motivated cult. THEY are secretly the oppressors, and I don\u2019t even think that they realize it. The goal of the LGBTQIA+ cult is get as many \u201coppressed people\u201d under one umbrella and get them all to vote Democrat. I\u2019ve been to support groups, (had horrible experiences every time) and if you don\u2019t align with them politically (I\u2019m a right-leaning independent) they\u2019ll try to guilt trip you into it, and if it\u2019s clear you\u2019re *gasp* NOT a Democrat, and you voice your opinion, they\u2019ll kick you out, and eliminate your voice all together (ironic when they claim they that want to give all LGBT people a voice) it\u2019s honestly disgusting, and this needs to be pointed out.\n\nWhen my college tells me that I need to \u201crequest\u201d gender inclusive housing, I\u2019ll simply respond with \u201cOh, I thought that was optional\u201d and see how they respond to that.\n\nThey\u2019re whole \u201cwe support LGBT people!\u201d Is BS and their support for trans people stops as soon it\u2019s not convient for them.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be forced to move in with a bunch of gay and trans people. Simple as that. Treat me like a normal human being and I\u2019ll respect you just like anyone else would. I\u2019m sure that there\u2019s at least one person in the school that isn\u2019t gonna care that I\u2019m trans, or maybe to them these are just solutions to things these people don\u2019t even know are problems. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t wanna be seen as an outcast, and I shouldn\u2019t be forced to be one.\n\nThank you for reading this, spread the word, people need to know about this. Publicity = normalization, they know this which is why they always try to silence us, despite try to convince us that we \u201chave a voice\u201d.  Which is only true if you\u2019re a democrat. I have no problem with these people existing, my problem is them trying to force me to be like them when I\u2019m not.\n\n- Anon Trans Girl", "date": "2018-08-09 20:28:51", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/9604tv/college_is_trying_to_force_me_to_be_an_outcast/", "author": "MainMasterpiece"}, {"title": "how do you all feel about nonbinary genders?", "text": "i'm a transmale and i believe that there are only two genders because there isn't any scientific evidence that i've found showing that it's possible to be both or neither or even change between them. however, i know a few dysphoric nonbinary people who are uncomfortable with their birth sex but wouldn't want to transition to the opposite sex. rather, they're uncomfortable with both but don't know how they'd transition. i know a lot of people feel differently about the issue so maybe i could get a second opinion on this?", "date": "2018-09-17 01:25:10", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/9gg288/how_do_you_all_feel_about_nonbinary_genders/", "author": "lowkeyparanoidboy"}, {"title": "Gender euphoria vs. dysphoria/incongruence?", "text": "I would consider myself a truscum, but I believe that individuals with gender euphoria and no dysphoria could still be trans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI see it this way because I see euphoria as another form of gender incongruence, just as dysphoria is.
