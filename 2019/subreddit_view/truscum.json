People can develop very complicated stress-related disorders and Personality Disorders, most of whom don't even realize they have them. Those are usually incurable for life (although manageable), not genetic or hereditary, but nobody argues that they are not real. GID could fall in the same lines - it's not that everyone diagnosed went through the same circumstances, just that they were particularly sensitive. Not everyone with PTSD went though the same circumstances either (and there are even ex-soldiers that don't have it).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think most trans people don't even want to consider this possibility because it takes away from the \"realness\" of being \"actually the other sex inside\". And the idea of not being a real man or woman, that the fault is on your own biology rather than society's bigotry, can be very painful and difficult to cope.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm FTM living full time for the last 9 years, I don't regret medically transitioning at all, but I have a deep understanding that I will not ever be a real man. I am not okay with it, but I make do with what I have. I believe transitioning is a way to manage (not cure) dysphoria, which is something that a person will have for life. If the dysphoria is not bad enough to warrant transitioning (medically, legally or socially), then the person should not be considered trans. The language would be much simpler if we considered \"trans\" a description for those who went through some form of transition instead of just a feeling or a condition you are supposedly born with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously, what triggers dysphoria for everyone is different so it would be hard to categorize. I think it's entirely possible that some women want to be men because they unconsciously want to escape the reality of being the weaker sex, or the sex that has historically been abused, raped and marginalized. They may want to be the sex that is able to impregnate rather than become pregnant, they may desire to penetrate rather than be penetrated. Maybe they want to have relationships with other men on equal terms, which is impossible if you are a woman. It could potentially be triggered by an event in which they wished they were (stronger) men so they could protect themselves or a loved one. Perhaps they could just be really competitive and wanted to be the fastest, tallest, strongest around, and realized male anatomy is much better suited for that, so they couldn't bear the reality of being female.  It's not normal for women to wish those things. This is disturbing and this is what separates those who ultimately have to transition to those who just wonder what it's like to pee standing up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor men, it could be the other way around. I can also imagine several possible reasons, such as not wanting to be seen as the sex that is the perpetrator of violence and abuse. Wanting to be protected rather than have the supposedly \"male responsibility\" of taking the protector role, having people \"fight for you\" rather than having to fight for yourself. Desiring more intimate relationships that are more common among women. Wanting to be able to gestate a life rather than just impregnate someone else, or to feel vulnerable to things that only women are vulnerable to. Maybe they felt that women were always at least a little afraid of them for being men, and wanted to have a relationship with a woman on equal terms. It could even be triggered by an event that made they think they wanted nothing to do with other men, that could be seen as the stereotype of loud, stupid and violent. Perhaps being a man was too stressful because it's too competitive, since men have the biological potential to be the fastest and strongest, and being a weaker woman is not only less shameful, but the norm. This is also not normal for men to wish for and it's what sets apart those who have to transition to manage dysphoria to those who wonder what it's like to wear skirts and have periods.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn certain parts of the world where it's forbidden or very stigmatized to be gay or lesbian, there are people who are motivated to transition as well. I know it sounds absurd, but to someone who has only ever seen heterosexual relationships, \"being gay\" might be interpreted as \"feeling as the other sex\". So what triggers someone's GID might be different not only from one person to another, but it could also statistically differ from one region and culture to another.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo anyway, after talking to and reading a lot of stories from even truscum transexual people, I've never seen someone whose motivation to transition didn't include one of those reasons I spoke of. Obviously, wanting to escape your biological or social reality is a much more complex reason for someone to want to be the other sex than liking pink, skirts and makeup, but nonetheless, it is still something that you are brought up to, and not hereditary. I have a lot of difficult believing it's genetic or neurological, so far there's no proof, and all indication seems very biased, coming from the same sort of people that believe in \"lady brains\". The outcome of those researches isn't even very convincing, there are many people that fall in both sides of the spectrum that both are and aren't trans, it just seems like something that is impossible to prove.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf it ever comes to light that it is actually a mental illness, it doesn't mean that medical and legal transition should be forbidden, it just shouldn't be given to anyone who requests it without any reason. There's very vast research from decades showing that strong dysphoria doesn't fade even after years of psychotherapy. If having people living as the other sex is what manages their dysphoria the best, then it should still be allowed. And even feminists, who believe social roles based on gender shouldn't exist, should understand that dysphoria isn't political and that feminism isn't capable of resolving all dysphoria. It's possible for one to understand both men and women can wear and do whatever they want, but still have unresolved feelings that can, so far, only be managed by transitioning.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what do you guys think?

Of course no one is going to shoot them down, or bother to suggest the problem is something else. Even worse is the number of people blatantly fessing up to their sexual fantasies and how that indirectly correlates with becoming trans.

So I'm sitting here right now laughing, not because it's funny, but in disbelief. How can one seriously have the audacity to assimilate such a sick thing with us? Oh and it doesn't stop there either. I've seen someone call themselves trans and mention they beat off to seeing a woman breastfeed a baby. God only knows what terrible things await their children. :/\n\nHow can any of this possibly go unnoticed and be seen as completely fine or even normal? The growing number of people jumping on board is frightening to say the least. What does being trans even mean anymore? If anyone can make up whatever they want and give themselves a sentence-long identity. Does anyone care to think how this impacts being trans as a whole? How it's making people take the idea less seriously?\n\nI consider myself trans and it's an act of choice fueled by melancholy of being. I spent the last 15 years of my life with crippling depression, no friends, no ability to socialize or interact with humans. Endured physical and sexual abuse, spent years undergoing counseling and therapy, attempted suicide, engaged in self harm. Now years later, I have been happier and more productive after finding a medium in which these issues can be tamed (though not entirely eradicated). I can't rewrite the way my brain works, nor will I ever be a biological mother. But I can continue to change for the better, and still adopt a child and nurture and love it.\n\nI'm tired of all these sick fetishistic @#$# who get off to womanhood or strive to be in a woman's space.

Because I think that a lot of people who (initially) say they don't have dysphoria don't understand what it actually means and/or aren't able to put their feelings into words correctly. Dysphoria is often described as an extreme hatred towards the own body, but I think it can also be experienced otherwise. For example as an extreme jealousy / want to be of the other gender so bad that it seriously impacts ones mental health. But I often see people be like \"I don't hate being X so I don't have dysphoria, I just want to be Y so bad I cry myself to sleep every night.\" Which I would still consider as dysphoric.

It's toxic, unrealistic and downright ridiculous. I was going to join a Facebook group once for trans men, but reading the rules, you weren't allowed to use 'gendered greetings'. Wtf? 'hey guys' is my standard greeting. It's freaking gender neutral (in this context). I hate y'all. Don't get me wrong, I think the y'all means all concept of pretty cool, but I live in the south. I don't use the word and don't plan on starting.\nMy first time encountering a tucute was mind blowing. I was so beyond pissed.

Idk) and a crop top while wearing heavy makeup, socks with lace on top (like my mom used to force me to wear as a kid) and freaking little white canvas keds - while doing that stick your leg and hip out pose with a peace sign and that ridiculous tongue out pose everyone is doing these days (ugh). Add some heart and butterfly stamps and a pink filter with the caption 'this outfit makes me so dysphoric, but I look cute so idc'.\nBitch, no the fuck it doesn't. If you were dysphoric, you wouldn't be wearing it. I can understand trying something on and saying to yourself 'wow, this item of clothing fits my body well and is quite flattering, but it makes me look/feel very feminine and I don't think I'd be comfortable wearing it' or something like that. I get those things. They're normal. I've tried on clothing that I felt fit well and looked great on me, but I didn't like the overall effect on my look.

I mean, it isn't a new thing of course, but it just seems like it's happening more.\n\nUnfortunately for me, I always feel as if I'm grouped in with tucutes. I 100% believe you need dysphoria to be trans, but I'm open to the idea of two \"nonbinary\" identities, bigender and agender. I'm actually agender, myself, which is what seems to get me lumped in with these groups. If I don't express my \"truscum views\" for fear of ridicule, but say I'm agender, I often hear \"well, you don't need dysphoria to be trans\" despite having gender dysphoria. Or I hear \"it's okay to be a gnc cis girl\" which is perfectly fine! I agree! But I'm not one. Wish I could be though. And if I still couldn't be cis, as bad as it might be to say, wish I could at least be a trans man so I'd be more understood and accepted. \n\nI've got social dysphoria, bottom dysphoria, and chest dysphoria, not to mention dysphoria over various other little things. I want a flat chest unsurprisingly, but I'm not comfortable with any genitals. If I could get rid of them completely with no issues, I would in a heartbeat. I suppose packing helps slightly, but that's only because it can sort of help me forget I'm biologically female at times. Having a penis isn't really any better for me, but sometimes it can help me feel more neutral vs male or female for some reason. I'm only really comfortable presenting fairly androgynous most of the time, and using they/them pronouns. I experiemented with the idea that maybe I'm a trans man, but after quite awhile of presenting male, using a male name, and going by he/him, I discovered that makes me just as dysphoric as presenting female, using my deadname, and going by she/her. I am on T though, and have been for about a year and 4 months, but I'll be stopping it this year.\n\nI know there's the argument of \"you dont need dysphoria if you have euphoria\" but I've never met someone who experienced gended euphoria and didn't later find out that it was due to unrecognized dysphoria they felt.\n\nIt's been a lifelong struggle for me because around age 5 or 6 when I first sort of came out, I was always dismissed because I didn't want to be a boy, but I wasn't a girl either. As I got older, and tried over and over to come out, I was never taken seriously or understood because I'm not a trans man. Finally I discovered other nonbinary people and figured I'd have a safe understanding community. And then I hear them all talk about starting hormones or getting surgery without dysphoria. I hear them encouraging others with their harmful views. Supporting others is one thing, but telling them how they feel is just part of the normal trans experience and encouraging them to transition anyway just rubs me the wrong way. Im never rude to anyone and I still respect pronouns and whatnot, but that doesn't mean I agree with what's going on, and I tend to try to talk to tucutes who are willing to listen. \n\nI've never met another nonbinary person who isn't a tucute, and I've lost friends over truscum views.

After a while, I realized that the sub was very VERY left leaning (which isn't too awfully bad, I'm center left myself) and hated truscum.  I was hurt but decided to stay.  After all, it was so fun to see all the bandwagons and memes.  I saw a meme that was very anti-transmed and all the comments were agreeing with the meme.  I left my comment defending Transmed ideology and got tons of hate from it.  I was banned, but my comments were still there to get down voted and so I could get hate but not be able to defend myself.  After reading the posts here, I realized that I'm not the only one this has happened to.  Fuck r/traa.  I believe there are good and logical people there, but wish I could get revenge.  Not only for myself, but for everyone else who has a similar or worse story too.  This is probably against some sort of rule, but I want to organize a raid or something.

I've seen some pretty lenient Transmeds here and then others who seemed pretty \"strict\" in their defining of transness, dysphoria etc. But that's not to shade anyone here, I don't care, just saying. \n\nAnyway, the question is, how do y'all feel about GNC (Gender-Non Conforming) trans people?

Whenever I'm in public I try to pass as best as I can because I'm pre-transition meaning I have to be as masculine as possible. I know I do pass pretty well, but I've been *really* wanting to do more feminine things and be able to do it in public, but I'm scared that'll make me pass less. \n\nI'm not really talking about like, wearing *dresses* or anything like that, but just simple things like painting my nails, wearing a little bit of makeup, wearing clothes that are in colors other than black for once lmao. Not only that, but I feel bad because it makes me feel like I have some sort of \"*internalized misogyny*\" because I try to avoid feminine things in public all the time. Y'all know, dysphoria central. It shows up in my art a lot too. Most of the male characters I draw I project onto and make more feminine, at least in terms of clothes. \n\nSo I guess another questions as well would be, would it be a good idea to be GNC in public? Like I said, I pass pretty okay, and the most I'd be able to pull off right now is painting my nails, but would that be too much of a risk? I mean, the worst that could happen is that I don't pass, people call me a dyke, my parents go \"I told you so, you're not trans etc etc\" and the best that could happen is I do pass, but people'll probably assume I'm some flamboyant gay boy (which isn't entirely incorrect, but I don't needa be called a faggot either) \n\nLong rant, yes, but I'm this is the best place to ask 'cause as I'm sure a lot of us are aware, *most* other Trans subreddits wouldn't be very reliable", "date": "2019-03-11 03:19:47", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/azoabd/trans_and_gnc/", "author": "lovingly-depraved"}, {"title": "How can only medical professionals gatekeep?", "text": "I've heard tons of people say that only medical professionals gatekeep but I don't understand how that can be true.

All truscum, or those who use the synonym transmedicalists, have their own sets of beliefs about being trans. Some believe in gender fluidity, others don't. Some believe gender euphoria is part of dysphoria, others don't.

A marked incongruence between one\u2019s experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2.

I was told that being truscum is the same as being transphobic.\"**  \n\n\nThere are a lot of common misconceptions about our belief system. In reality, it really isn't so radical. Here are some myths about transmedicalism:  \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists don't believe nonbinary is a valid identity.*\n\nPeople have differing beliefs on nonbinary identities, but these beliefs have nothing to do with transmedicalism. For every anti-nonbinary transmedicalist you see, there are one or two pro-nonbinary transmedicalists. We're all different!  \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists believe you need to physically transition (through hormones, SRS, etc.) to be trans.*\n\nWhile a lot of transmedicalists/truscum believe you should at least /want/, ideally, to have a more masculine, feminine or androgynous body, the vast majority of us do **not** believe medical transition is necessary to be transgender. We recognize there are a huge amount of trans people who can't afford medical interventions, can't handle surgery or hormonal reactions, don't feel dysphoric enough about a certain trait to change it, etc.  \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists are all jerks, though, right?*\n\nTumblr and Instagram are homes to the worst of every community. Try spending some time with us, we're all individuals.   \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists hate GNC trans people/think you can't be trans and GNC!*\n\nThis is blatantly untrue. Plenty of transmedicalists don't understand /why/ someone would lower their chance of passing, but almost every transmedicalist supports GNC trans people wholeheartedly, and plenty of us ARE gender non-conforming ourselves.  \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists don't think gender euphoria, or just gender incongruence, is a valid reason to transition!*\n\nEvery transmedicalist is different. Yes, some transmedicalists don't believe in gender euphoria, but it's not an inherent transmedicalist belief. The only inherent belief is \"dysphoria is necessary to be transgender\" and nothing more -- plenty of us simply count gender euphoria and incongruence as part of dysphoria. Heck, the first symptom listed at the top of this post *is* gender incongruence!  \n\n\n&gt;*Transmedicalists are...*\n\nPeople who believe you need dysphoria to be trans, and nothing else. We are not *inherently* anything. Generalizations are bad and everyone can make them.

So at best I'll be more female than male physically but never just female, who I am mentally. I wish I could think differently but I see no alternative point of view that is based in reality but rather more positive alternatives comes off to me as lying to myself which I've done plenty of in reverse previously (instead of telling myself I have a real female body which I don't and never quite will I was telling myself I was simply a crossdressing guy despite knowing that mentally that was a lie).

Because what is \"presenting as male\"? Male isn't a gender expression. Male simply just mean that you have a male body and female just means you have a female body. So the problem is that I don't like presenting myself very masculine. I'd like to think that my personality has both masculine and feminity in it.

I personally belive that social dysphoria is only valid if you also have body dysphoria. Because that is like adding a little more salt on your food if you get what I mean?

This might be a really dumb question, but to start, how do you guys define gender dysphoria? I did see the stickied post, but that spoke very broadly, and I'm curious to hear about some more specific aspects of it from people who know that they are trans. \n\nI guess I want to know because I don't really know how to interpret my feelings beyond the fact that they're not normal. My main concern is that the idea of being trans is more a fetish for me, and the feelings I have are to just further that fetish for me. As opposed to those feelings telling me, hey you're trans. This is difficult for me to say, but this is a concern for me because I have been fetishising trans people. Some of my first exposure to trans people was through porn, and that was a combination of pre-op trans women, crossdressers, \"traps\", and all those other labels they have. I have a problem with masturbation, and all those people I mentioned just before have made up the majority of the porn I've consumed for longer than I care to admit. And for a while, I didn't really think past beyond hey I think this is hot. But after some time,  and seeing some of these people I was getting off talk about their being trans and transitioning (a lot of these people had nsfw Tumblr blogs they'd post to, but also talk about/vent about their transitioning, or lack thereof if they were just a crossdresser) I started to wonder about doing it too, not really anything deep, just again like hey it'd be hot if I tried on some woman's clothes. And so I did, I would dress up and play with make up and get off to it all. \n\nThis continued for a while, but somewhere along the way, after reading some people talk about they know that crossdressing is just a fetish for them, and they have no desire to transition, the question did finally explicitly cross my mind. Like I asked myself, is this just a fetish for me, or is it something more? And I couldn't really give myself a definite answer. That's where I'm sort of at today. That was probably over a year ago at this point, and I don't really feel any closer to having an answer. I am so nervous and anxious about the answer and me knowing the right answer because I don't want to start transitioning and go through all of the really difficult stuff   associated with that, and wake up one day and realize I made a huge mistake. I think this paranoia is partly coming from some of the bad things I have heard about the mainstream trans communities (particularly some on Reddit), and also the trans porn community, and the stories I've read of people and their regrets of transitioning.\n\nTo start to wrap this up, where I'm at today. I definitely do enjoy some traditionally feminine things, like dresses and make up, keeping my hair long, and the idea of presenting as a woman, although I am very unsure if that enjoyment is just fetishisation or legitimate dysphoria. I also do like the idea of having a woman's anatomy, like having breasts and a vagina. But I don't explicitly like hate any particular part of my physical body, like I'm not explicitly happy with it, but I definitely don't have a strong opposition feeling against it. I do have low self-esteem and a lot of self hate, but I also already a diagnosed mental illness, that being ADHD, so there is an already legitimate reason for those feelings, to an extent. I actually saw a psychiatrist for several years, but I'm 20 now and stopped seeing them because they were a pediatric psychiatrist. But during that time, I wasn't really questioning my identity at all, so the question never came up. I don't really hate my penis either, I can't imagine getting it completely removed if I were to transition, I think I'd want to keep it. I do look at women sometimes and envy them for the way they look and the way they are, but again I'm unsure of the source of these feelings. Like I said, I'm 20, but I've never been in a romantic relationship with anyone, or had sex or anything close to that, so I don't know if that is playing it to as well or what. The last thing I want to say is that the idea of transitioning just scares the fuck out of me, the fear of coming out to my family (Even though I am certain they'd accept me) and also to my peers and everyone else in my life. And just everything else, going on HRT, presenting as a woman to the world, changing my name and pronouns, I cannot describe how nervous and anxious I am about just thinking about having to go through all of that. I already have certain problems with socializing and stuff, so the idea of having to explain to people, my family, my close friends, that I was trans just seems like almost impossible to do.\n\nI'm sorry for this too long and rambling post, and also sorry if this isn't the most appropriate subreddit to post something like this, but I feel more safe posting it here than on other communities on reddit.

Some societies and cultures have MULTIPLE GENDERS!\" \nWell, my fellow logical human beings, I am an anthropology major, and we just finished up this segment of lessons in my class, so I thought I would share what we have been learning in a field dominated my facts and empirical evidence rather than one based on emotion (anthropology vs psychology) because IDK, I found this insight very interesting and worth knowing for the sake of education and debate in regards to being transgender and the concept of gender as a whole. \n\nFirst thing we learned: yes, in anthropology, gender is reliant on culture. HOWEVER \"gender\" in this sense is not your identity, and would more accurately be described as the roles typically assigned to males and females in a culture. So in more common terms, gender itself isn't a social construct, but gender norms and roles are. \nI feel like this is an idea that a lot of us can get behind. Sure, what we inherently deem as masculine and feminine is reliant on culture, but us being trans isn't. \n\nSecondly, the idea of multiple genders. With the definition we use in anthropology, this still works. Not in the sense of a magical 3rd gender existing, but in the sense of there being masculine men, feminine women, masculine women, feminine men, neutral individuals, etc. \nOne example I've seen tucutes mention a lot is the presence of two-spirit individuals in Native American culture; just like with most \"evidence based arguments\" tucutes  try to give however, this is a warped understanding. \nYes, Native Americans technically have three genders: male, female, and the third gender would be trans people, so mtf and ftm type individuals. This \"third gender\" is simply a separate classification of trans people, not a new concept. And these two-spirit individuals don't always match what would be considered trans, and instead they simply fit into both the typical male and female roles within the tribe. \nAn even better example of this is in the Bugis of Indonesia. This group has 5 genders: male, female, ftm, mtf, and neutral.

I like you guys.\nFor the longest time I thought all the communities I joined were just point blank insane.\n\nI'll get into that point now, I guess.\nI hate how they literally are \"transgender\" and that's it. Its like their identity. A person is so much more than their sexuality or gender.\nFor me personally, why yes, I am transgender. It's not who I am, its just what I am and that has caused me so many issues (fuck you dysphoria), I'll touch on this later, for now. Lets talk about the lovely communities. \n\nWell, my main complaint is they push being transgender onto ANYBODY. Oh you like girly clothes youre trans, oh you like boy stuff trans, oh you have emotions trans, oh you have a fetish about having breasts trans.\nIt's like, stop it. You're ruining it for the people who are doing this so they can live their lives. \nInbefore a huuuuuge wave of detransitions in a few years and we become an even bigger joke.\n\nThen their attitudes in general, they fetishize and use all the sexist points that really damage the gender they seemingly want to identify as.. \nLike fuck, some of those I swear only are transitioning for sexual reasons, or they got sucked into sissy porn. It's sad how many people are ruining their lives. \n\nDont even get me started on showing any logic around them, its their safe space you need to accept the autismgender person wanting to dress up like a bimbo and get railed for a fetish. \nLike fuck, they way they carry on about clothes, breasts. Why do they get so turned on? I dont get it.\n\nI'm MtF personally, and well. Transitioning is my last option, if I don't do this I won't be here. \nI looked at all the options, alternates, but browsing the trans subs makes me sick to my core. Half the stuff they go on about looks like some bullshit they made up, any actual trans people are shunned down by the trenders and their overly fetish driven desires. \nLike I dont care your lady clit got hard in your new panties cease, i dont care you get super aroused playing with your breasts dressed up like a hoe. \nI literally struggle to find sane people. I ask for simple advice Oh HoNeY JuST ACCEpt YoURSelF FoR Who YoU Are\nYou dont think i would if i could? Literally turning to transitioning so I can live a normal life, its my only path left and I've accepted deep down I'll take the hit and live true to myself and try ease this damned dysphoria, its ruined my life honestly. I want to claw my life back and live a normal quiet life. \n\nGuh, I'm ranting now. Sorry, I feel like if anybody will read this without ripping me a new one it'll be somewhere here.\nI hate the public trans community these days. Its shameful how they are.\n\n\nIt's nice to not have to add a trigger warning too. I really don't understand people these days. \ud83d\ude10\n\n\nEdit: I'm 22 and have been struggling with dysphoria for seemingly all my life, I'm over it, so I'm transitioning and planning to live life over rotting away, it's been 7 years since I learnt about what was wrong with me, I've seen multiple therapists and flopped around different fixes.

I honestly feel like these \"truscum\" views and opinions used to be the norm, never thought that a cute and relatable meme subreddit would become what feels like a mockery of what it used to be... and more importantly, I felt totally lost when looking for support or discussion. I just wanna be a cis girl, yo. Or as close as I can be.\n\nI took the time to educate myself on what \"truscum\" actually means and, well, I guess that this place is where all the sane trans folk are.

My mom used to drop me off at my aunts house along with my sister when my dad was going nuts. Because all cousins there were girls, and we had no change of clothes I had to wear their stuff.\n\nWasn\u2019t really a big deal for me back then, after all I was like 9 y/o so it didn\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t even knew the difference between girls and boys. And because I\u2019m intersex I started discovering them very, very late.\n\nWhen I was like 13 or 14, I really started experiencing dysphoria. The reason was that I\u2019ve been measured as 173 tall (5\u20198) and was tallest person in class back then.\n\nBut then I started noticing changes in people around me. Their voices dropping, developing body hair, starting to grow breasts, and generally shifting in more like men and women instead of boys and girls.\n\nI was terrified that I would start developing like my male classmates, after all I was AMAB. But I didn\u2019t after all. Even when I was finishing the middle school at 15 (usually 16 but I\u2019ve been born by the end of the year), I was a genderless blob that I was when I was 12.\n\nBecause of that, I had mostly female friends as I couldn\u2019t get along with guys. They\u2019ve been jealous about how skinny I was, but they didn\u2019t realised that I\u2019ve been dealing with bulimia (but can\u2019t blame them, I realised it just recently).\n\nThings were fine for the most part. I had friends, had also enemies. Had my escape (music) and passions. But I never saw that one day coming. You see, I never attended PE but had to leave my backpack in the changing room and were allowed to take my phone with me to the class, I\u2019d sit on a bench and watch. Thinking about it now, it was painful being separated like that but my body was so weak that I couldn\u2019t do even basic exercises. So one day I went into the changing room, put my bag on the floor and were about to leave. Suddenly I felt that someone grabbed my trousers and pulled them down, along with my pants. Turned around to see what the f..k was going on, and heard hysterical laughter directed at my genitals. I\u2019ll spare you details, but they definitely weren\u2019t \u201cnormal\u201d. I pulled my trousers up and left, thought that it was a stupid situation that would just be a silly teenage memory. But oh boy, I was so wrong. My brain still makes me re-live that, sometimes even making up scenarios of being used sexually (aka raped) in my dreams (or rather nightmares)\n\nBefore I knew, guys started calling me a freak, weirdo etc., and that only got worse over time. One time even lead to the situation where teacher asked me a question because I wasn\u2019t paying attention and I couldn\u2019t respond. Felt only tightness in my chest and started crying uncontrollably. That was my first panic attack, and around that time I started self-harming in various forms, but mostly cutting, burning and biting.\n\nI finished the middle school somehow. I decided that start of high school would be a fresh start. I\u2019ve started dating a girl named Anna (which was probably the biggest mistake of my life, didn\u2019t go beyond kissing on a cheek and lasted a month). When I think about that now, it was so pathetic. I also started forcing my voice to get lower so people wouldn\u2019t classify me as a girl based on that.\n\nBut all my attempts in \u201cmanning up\u201d failed. The reason is simple, I\u2019m just not a dude and subconsciously I knew that. After all, dysphoria was there. Plus because of my condition my body didn\u2019t develop the \u201cmale\u201d way. It all leaded to June of 2014. My 4th suicide attempt, at 17 which my body barely survived. I\u2019ve destroyed my body so much that I really felt the consequences of that. 173cm tall, 46kg (5\u20198, 100lbs).\n\nAfter that I decided that if I can\u2019t even do it properly, I might as well just try transitioning. Diagnostic process took 1,5 years and I became more or less clean over that time. Few months after I turned 19, I\u2019ve been prescribed HRT which I had no expectations about.\n\nThe longer I was on it, the more changes I started noticing. At first it started to help deal with emotional trauma and C-PTSD. It also started improving ADHD-I, which makes sense because my body finally got a fuel to work on and that resulted in puberty and brain development (which is proven that ADD is correlated with). My scars started healing, gained muscle mass and overall strength. Skin started to look way healthier, smoother. Started growing breasts, which was really slow but can\u2019t complain about the results. My vocal chords healed as well, making me sound like cis woman my age. Depersonalisation completely gone, ED massively improved as well. Had few relapses of SH, including recent one but nowhere as bad as they used to be.\n\nAnd yet in all of this, I lost a sense of \u201cself\u201d. Maybe I never had one in the first place? I keep saying that gender doesn\u2019t matter to me. But at the same time I\u2019m kinda torn between not caring about my appearance and being like others. Like what tripped me today is that I went shopping in the hoodie and joggers because I was really not feeling like it but had to buy groceries. I\u2019ve never felt that before, but I was literally ashamed of how I\u2019m dressed, and jealous how other women were dressed like. It\u2019s stupid because it doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ve been just picking some stuff from the shop in town so spending time on preparing would be pointless. But I did felt like that.\n\nIn theory, nothing stops me from dressing in crop top and shorts. But the thing is, despite all of what I said, I still can\u2019t look in the mirror naked. It\u2019s repulsive and shows all flaws. Short clothes would do as well, including stretch marks, scars etc.\n\nMy biggest fear however is that... what if I dress like this and someone will be able to tell that I\u2019m not AFAB? I could get laughed at, or even attacked. And that completely terrifies me. It\u2019s a stupid fear since I\u2019m stealth and haven\u2019t been misgendered in ages, even in my work uniform.\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to think about it all, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m posting here. At least I know that people here will be honest. Can you all help me figure that stuff out?\n\ntl;dr: Story of my messed up childhood, trying to find myself and get life together while struggling with C-PTSD, ADHD-I, BDD, bulimia and dysphoria", "date": "2019-04-19 17:42:45", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bf2046/posting_here_because_i_know_i_can_count_on_you/", "author": "medlthrowaway"}, {"title": "Help a detransitioned woman understand things better?", "text": "I don't know if this is the right flair, so sorry.\n\nI've been a little scared to ask for a discussion here as I've seen some of you have hostility toward detransitioners. I saw in the rules that those of us who are not trans are welcome, I don't know how you'd feel about someone who would be a former \"tucute\" in your book, although I personally feel that wasn't exactly my particular case. For background I will mention that I \"am\" gender critical leaning, but I have some pretty strong differences that aren't related to politics with some of them which I'll list here.\n\n* I do believe that one has to experience anatomical dysphoria(with a desire to do something as it is a necessity, obviously things like finances can get in the way) in a tighter sense to be trans.\n* I will not intentionally misgender individuals unless I suspect(with enough evidence, like certain criminals) they are abusing the struggle of authentic people struggling with a medical condition. I feel that an identity needs revealed in its fullest if the person is a threat to society. Arguably these individuals I don't view it as \"misgendering\" because they aren't trans, they're trying to abuse a condition to get off the hook or gain sympathy. That being said if someone is trans, I will treat them to the best of my ability like I would someone of their transitioned/transitioning to sex.\n* Although I do not believe that non-binary is something you can be dysphoric in relation to(as I believe personally the whole concept is social, partly why I'm here.) I do support people being able to dress and act how they please regardless of sex as long as it doesn't harm or disturb(open display fetishes, I don't care about their \"discomfort\" regarding clothing, that's childish) other people.\n* I do not regard the surgeries you undergo as mutilation or as self-harm so long as they really do help you in the end.\n* Thanks to an intersex person from a transmedicalist support discord, I have gained the belief that surgically transitioned trans people are closer to intersex men &amp; women and should be treated similarly, as in the distinction should only be made when it is necessary. Trans women are a form of woman, trans men are a form of men. There are overlaps even regarding those that are not surgically transitioned but more situations where the distinction should be made.\n* I do not have an issue with sex dysphoric women or men that I wouldn't know are trans using the facilities of their transitioned sex, so long as they don't try to alter the general atmosphere, rules or take advantage of individuals who might be traumatized by the other sex.\n* If a person who does not have sex dysphoria can be gender non-conforming, so can someone with sex dysphoria.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently a really ugly situation popped up in the subreddit I am one of the moderators of and I want to learn more about the authentic cases of those who call themselves transmedicalist, truscum or even transsexual. I want to learn more so I can potentially do something to stop something from spiraling completely out of control as I understand a lot of detransitioners hold hostility toward the concept of trans as a whole. As a moderator of said subreddit I am disappointed in myself because I feel that I was a bit unfair to the trans individual involved in this and I want to know for future cases of it happening again how to control the fire before people throw gasoline over it in a sense.\n\nI follow a policy regarding the dysphoria I experienced after I took testosterone for a year which led to a disconnect of sorts and the changes making me more and more miserable by the week. **Obviously if I could feel this after trying to modify my body, then someone could be born with this sort of feeling, so am I right to feel this way?** **Or am I missing the point?**\n\nIn the past I have had some very.. unpleasant engagements with people who claimed to be trans and have actually attacked me in our discussions for feeling confused and hurt. **Can I have some explanation calmly as to what you believe entails a male and female brain?** obviously I will give my own definition first. What I believe in is that our brains have a blueprint of sorts and that when our body strays from that physical blueprint it leads to immense discomfort, distress and even panic. So because of this belief I think that a trans woman would be uncomfortable with her genitalia and flat chest as these are traits that those born female do not have. I also believe that a trans man would be uncomfortable with his genitalia not due to the discomfort caused by the menstrual cycle but because of the fact it feels alien, or wrong to him. Sadly having been there myself I am not going to dismiss my own bias and skepticism toward distress involving wanting to be less sexualized by peers.\n\nI don't understand the concept of non-binary, but I am open to learning. I don't get how one can feel they are neither male nor female as the range of male and female physical traits actually overlap into each other and would in theory make it impossible to fit as \"neither.\" The only logical way I could even process this is to become something completely inhuman through extensive surgery. So I ask, **what is a non-binary dysphoric person exactly?**\n\n**Do you believe in the idea of trying to treat or explore other underlying issues such as PTSD, trauma caused incidents or anything on the autism spectrum before exploring the idea of transition? What about gender nonconformity?**\n\nI have a very strict stance in regards to puberty blockers but I do feel that if one is proven to be free of any underlying issues that can replicate gender dysphoria or seem similar to it that it can be a treatment to result in a more healthy and fitting body for the sex dysphoric individual. That being said that if an individual has a history of underlying trauma or other issues that could manifest similar to gender dysphoria, I feel that they should not be allowed to take HRT until they are legally an adult because at this point it's their body and their decision.  **Am I wrong to have this approach on child HRT treatment?** My belief on this matter stems from the fact I took testosterone at 14 and part of 15 and it has messed me up well into my late 20s.\n\n**Should a post-op trans woman have to disclose her trans medical history to a partner before things get intimate?**\n\n**How do you feel regarding trans people in professional sports? I'll keep my own views on this one quiet for now.**\n\nI could come up with more questions but I think that's enough for now, a lot of the previous issues I've had to deal with have had to do with the above questions.

I figured this was the most appropriate place to put this. First post here, but I figure I\u2019ll fit in here; I wholeheartedly agree with this sub and I\u2019m so grateful this sub exists. We don\u2019t need any more idiots making trans people look bad. I\u2019m glad we have this sub to argue against these people.\n\nGender dysphoria is a real medical condition. Let me get something out of the way real quick: so, I have a friend who doesn\u2019t believe gender dysphoria exists, which I got pretty outraged about because that just denies medical evidence and invalidates all trans people. His words were, \u201cGender dysphoria doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s just body dysmorphia.\u201d I was blown away by the pure ignorance. He then went on to say, \u201cI don\u2019t like them. They\u2019re so annoying demanding to be called something they\u2019re not.\u201d\nSee how much influence the nutjobs all over tumblr who insist being trans is just some kind of choice are having over people? Sorry, just needed to mention that.\n\nLast year, I argued against someone who believed dysphoria isn\u2019t a requirement for being trans. I emphasized how much pain dysphoria causes, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re making it out to be this awful thing.\u201d\nNoooo, really?\n\n\u2022Being called the wrong pronouns for most of your life (and sadly, for some, still to this day) is totally fine.\n\n\u2022Not being able to live a normal life because you\u2019re constantly getting hurt by the people who claim gender dysphoria doesn\u2019t exist, the people who think you\u2019re totally invalid and the people who think it\u2019s a political thing and claim it\u2019s a choice is also just fine and dandy.\n\n\u2022Never feeling like a true man or woman and hating yourself, possibly even being suicidal (the suicide statistics for trans people are frightening) is a great time.\n\n\u2022Having to fight to be the gender you truly are, but getting so much backlash from ignorant people, trolls and bullies is a joy.\n\n\u2022Having to undergo surgery and lifelong hormonal treatment just to be happy and hate yourself less is fun! Not to mention the amazing journey of having to come out to people, having to face losing people and all!\n\n\u2022Sometimes even being viewed as less than human and having trouble getting into relationships is one of the best feelings in the world!\n\nShould I go on? Being trans doesn\u2019t involve any kind of suffering at all! Nope, never! It\u2019s all sunshine and rainbows, duh! And of course it never means you have to have dysphoria!!!\n\n\nHonest question: how do some supposed \u201ctrans people\u201d without dysphoria (AKA cis people) feel the need to have surgery then? Do they just one day think, \u201cMeh, I\u2019m bored today, let\u2019s just cut off this body part/add a new body part\u201d? Isn\u2019t dysphoria what pushes you to have surgery and undergo treatment?\n\nAlso, what\u2019s up with all these tucutes going on hormone therapy? Last time I checked, there were requirements and regulations for that. 2 years of living as that gender (I believe 2 years, I could be wrong though), a required amount of therapy and a letter from the therapist, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and other things. That\u2019s what it used to be. Did something change? Because it seems a lot of tucutes are able to go on hormones or have surgery really quickly. Did they get rid of all the regulations? If so, I personally think that\u2019s pretty dang unethical.\n\nThere\u2019s so much more to say here but this is all my mind is coming up with at 3 in the morning. I needed to get this out. Stupid people (ignorant people) are sure to get my blood boiling. And it\u2019s totally invalidating to real trans people.\n\nSo, to my lovely people struggling with gender dysphoria, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to deal with these people. I can\u2019t wrap my head around their mindset, honestly. It makes zero sense whatsoever. Stay strong, okay? I\u2019m always here for you. Trust me, I know it\u2019s hard, but try to disregard all types of transphobia, INCLUDING the people who vehemently believe gender dysphoria isn\u2019t a requirement to be considered trans.

Jaw surgery is honestly my priority over top surgery given that it'll help with more aspects of my life, including probably my transition, but top surgery is still very important for me and very necessary. Problem is, I don't want to risk anything by getting surgery after surgery done. I know chances are they aren't going to be willing to operate on me immediately after I've had another surgery done, but I want to be able to gauge if I could reasonably have top surgery scheduled and done before ortho while I'd have braces, or if it's something I should wait for until everything else is done. I just want to avoid running into issues or potentially causing damage to my body by rushing into so many things at once when I'm finally able to, or scheduling conflicts.\n\nHow quickly were you guys approved?

Welcome to my TED-talk about my gender, mental illness and pretty much everything else.\u00a0\n\nFirst of here\u2019s so \u201cquick\u201d info that\u2019s probably nice to know:\n\n* I was born in November 1998 which at this point in time makes me 20 years old.\n* I was born a girl, biologically and legally I still am a girl.\n* I pretty much lived as a boy up until I was 12\n   * I dressed exclusively in boys clothes, with the exception of my underwear and a bridesmaid dress once.\n   * I was of the belief that I was, in fact, a boy in a girl\u2019s body.\u00a0\n   * I used my birth name and she/her pronouns at all times expect a two week period when I was like 8 or 9 where I convinced my grandmom, parents, and siblings to call me Liam and use he/him pronouns.\u00a0\n   * I was aware that I wasn\u2019t biologically like the other boys, but because we were so young that we hadn\u2019t hit puberty yet it didn\u2019t really matter.\u00a0\n   * I played soccer on a mixed team until I turned 11 and had to change to a girls team (i was very displeased). It honestly caused a lot of trouble because other teams thought I was a boy and that we were breaking the rules, but that\u2019s a story for another day.\n   * I was almost always\u00a0\u201cmisgendered\"(he/him), but I liked it.\u00a0\n   * My parents would always respectfully let people know that I was, in fact, a girl.\u00a0\n   * I knew what changes puberty would do to my body and I was NOT pumped.\u00a0\n   * When I started to develop breasts I did my very best to hide it for everyone.\n   * I started dressing like a girl/more androgynous when I was 12/13, but only did it because that was expected of me since I had started puberty.\n* Between the ages of 13-18, I don\u2019t think a lot about gender, but looking back it still affected my life a lot.\n   * I dressed androgynously most of the time, 90% of my clothes were bought from the boys/men section.\n   * I wished for masculine traits eg. broad shoulders, being tall, square body, etc.\n   * In 2014, I start following a couple of people online who were/are trans and I spend a lot of time on the internet trying to understand what it really means to be transgender. I\u2019ve known the term for some time, but never really spend time reading further into it before now.\u00a0\n   * I got the thought \u201cwhat if that\u2019s what I am?\u201d for the first time.\u00a0\n   * I was almost always wearing a sports bra because I liked the way they\u00a0\u201csquished\u201d my breasts so they looked smaller instead of enhancing them like a bra.\n   * I wore a beautiful dress at prom and another dress when I graduated high school. They were definitely beautiful but it was just so unnatural and unpleasant. It didn\u2019t feel like the true me.\u00a0\n* I graduate high-school summer of 2017, move out and start university in September of 2017.\n   * Everything is going well. I\u2019ve truly never been this happy.\n* In December 2017 I\u2019m diagnosed with depression and anxiety. (Yeah that took a wild turn lmao)\n   * I start seeing a therapist.\u00a0\n   * I take some leave of absence from my bachelor\u2019s degree in sport science.\u00a0\n   * I start seeing a psychiatrist.\n   * I start taking Effexor. \n* **Nothing works.**\u00a0\u00a0\n* I research \u201cgender dysphoria\u201d.\u00a0\n   * I truly believe that some of what I\u2019m experiencing is caused by that, because:\n      * I despise my chest, my curves, my genitalia, everything categorized as female traits. \n      * I have never felt \"connected\" to the before mentioned body parts. \n      * I feel like I'm pretending to be a girl.\n      * I realize that I will not naturally grow into a man (I have always visualized my adult-self as a man).\n      * The thought of living the rest of my life as a girl makes me want to kill myself even more.\n* I give it some time.\u00a0\n   * After about a month, A LOT of thought and\u00a0copious amount of research\u00a0\n      * I make a blog on Tumblr to connect with other FTM/Transmed people (May 2018)\u00a0\n      * Buy a binder online from GC2B.\n      * Pretty much start living as a guy (in my everyday life, not around friends or family).\u00a0\n   * All of this in the hopes that this is all I\u2019ve been needing to kick this dysphoria's/depression's ass was to live my true self.\u00a0\n* I give it everything I got.\u00a0\n   * I go to the barber.\u00a0\n   * I let my body hair grow all out.\u00a0\n   * I buy male EVERYTHING!!\n      * Male clothes.\n      * Male underwear.\n      * Male shampoo.\n      * Male deodorant.\n      * Male cologne.\u00a0\n   * I wear my\u00a0\u201cmale look\u201d everywhere, family dinner?

NO!!!\n   * Maybe I\u2019m just lonely? I meet a guy who develops feelings for me. It does nothing.\u00a0\n   * I try the same shit with a girl. It does nothing.\u00a0\n   * I get drunk for the first time in a year. It does nothing except giving me a hangover.\u00a0\n   * I hang out with friends. It does nothing.\u00a0\n   * It does not matter where I am, what I\u2019m wearing, how much hair I have, who I\u2019m with, what I do.

I think it'd be about as common as someone having [Body Integrity Dysphoria](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_dysphoria), as I think humans are generally predisposed to identify with one or the other main sex.\n\nNow, to the situation. My fianc\u00e9 came to me quite upset the other day because he felt like something was deeply wrong with his identity. He said that he was comfortable with having a penis, and identifying as male, but that he felt a lot more comfortable in feminine clothes, and he felt like maybe he is supposed to have breasts.\n\nWe talked about it, and came to the conclusion that maybe the problem is just that he feels like he can't be feminine because he's a naturally very masculine looking person (6'1\", 270lbs, strong as hecc). But that doesn't explain the other desire, and I know it's not a fetish. I think he just likes to feel pretty, and that feels like part of it to him.\n\nI'm not sure what I can do to help. I don't want to discourage him from expressing himself at all, or from confiding in me. So for the last few days, I've been helping him try makeup, wear more feminine clothes, and wear nail polish.

Sorry.\n\nIn my experience, most 'truscum' believe non-binary trans people are not real, and are either confused cis or confused binary trans people (I know not all truscum believe this). Obviously this makes me generally not want to associate with most truscum, and they generally do not want to associate with me either.\n\nAt the same time, many of the trans spaces that are very accepting of practically all genders often feel like they've taken such a black and white stance. That **all** people who claim to be any gender are valid, you don't need dysphoria to be trans, and anyone who questions this at all is a terrible person and should be banned immediately.\n\nI actually kind of agree with having the policy of \"You don't need dysphoria to be trans.\" I think a lot of trans people have a very hard time accepting themselves, and will be hesitant to admit they do have dysphoria, or misunderstand what dysphoria is, or might mistakenly believe they need an actual medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to be trans. To me, getting a diagnosis doesn't make you trans, it only confirms it. For this reason, I think it can be harmful to tell people they *must* have dysphoria to be trans.\n\nBut, I think I do believe that all actual trans people do have dysphoria. Reading the DSM-5's criteria for diagnosing gender dysphoria (this subreddit seems to be using some version that is not NB inclusive), I can't see how anyone who fits any useful definition of non-binary could not check at least two of them.\n\nI see people say/do things that don't seem at all like something a transgender person would say/do, while claiming to be non-binary. Then, communities like r/traa will insist that they are completely valid, as if no cis person could ever misunderstand what it means to be transgender and adopt a label that doesn't really fit them.\n\nFor example, I sometimes see non-binary people who claim that they're completely comfortable being seen as their AGAB, aren't uncomfortable with their body at all, are totally content with a name and pronouns of their AGAB, and have no desire to transition. They just don't feel strongly attached to their AGAB. **What exactly makes them trans then?** A lot of cis people, if asked, don't feel particularly attached to their AGAB either.\n\nI can't relate to or understand these people at all.\n\nAt the same time, I don't really believe that not understanding or relating to these people is a good enough reason to say that they're not actually trans. Obviously as a non-binary person I've been on the receiving end of similar arguments from truscum. Most binary truscum can't relate to or understand my experience, and use that to invalidate me.\n\nI find it very frustrating that in practically all spaces that accept non-binary people, any discussion of what makes someone trans or cis is aggressively shut down as truscum rhetoric. I actually want to understand why someone would say that they're non-binary while experiencing almost none of the things that I'd associate with being non-binary.\n\nI don't believe definitions of words or identities are completely rigid, and I generally greatly dislike gatekeeping, but at some point you can be using a word/identity in the wrong way, right?\n\nI try to think of it in terms of this sexual orientation analogy:\n\nI think it's generally agreed that straight people are attracted to the opposite gender, and bisexual people are attracted to their own gender and the opposite (and/or sometimes others). Bisexual people don't have to have their attraction split 50/50 to be bisexual. To me, even 95/5 is valid. I think even a man saying \"I've only ever been really attracted to one or two men\" is a valid bisexual, because it shows he does have the ability to be attracted to his own gender.\n\nBut if a man says \"I think some men have aesthetically pleasing faces, but I have no desire to date, kiss, have sex, or do anything else sexual or romantic with any man\", then claims to be bisexual, surely he is wrong? Either he is adopting a label that does not actually fit him, or possibly he actually does have desire to do some of those things and is repressing it. I don't think this is even controversial among LGB people. Sure, labels are somewhat flexible, but at *some point* you can be using a label wrong.\n\nMisusing a label like that can do harm too. Mostly, it misleads uninformed people into thinking that label means something that it doesn't.\n\nSo when someone says they're non-binary, but they don't desire to be seen or treated as another gender, they don't feel any incongruence between their experienced gender and their sexual characteristics, they have no desire for at least some of the sexual characteristics of the opposite gender as their AGAB, no desire to get rid of any of their own sexual characteristics, and just seemingly no desire to transition in any way, **why do they call themselves non-binary?** With no explanation, my mind can only come up with reasons like\n\n\\- They don't conform to some of the stereotypes of their gender, and they think that makes them non-binary.\n\n\\- They believe all cis and binary trans people have a strong feeling of being a certain gender, and the fact that they don't feel super attached to their AGAB makes them non-binary.\n\n\\- They wanted to be part of the LGBT community.\n\n\\- Other more sinister reasons I will not say here.\n\nThe frustrating thing is that any discourse about this gets shut down, so I feel like I can never find out the actual reasons. It ends up feeling like a sizable minority of non-binary people really are just confused and/or lying.\n\nIt's frustrating that these people then spread information about what the non-binary experience that misleads uninformed people. It's very frustrating that as a result, when I tell people I'm non-binary they assume that means I'm basically just a man that doesn't like gender roles. Many of the masculine features of my body make me uncomfortable, and I've struggled with body image issues since puberty as a result. Being called a man, seen as a man and treated as a man makes me quite uncomfortable. These issues probably contributed significantly to me being very depressed for a long time and attempting suicide. I've started HRT and have been feeling better with every change it has brought so far. I'm currently in the process of getting people to use my new name and pronouns, and intend to legally change my name and gender marker on ID.\n\nA lot of people seem legitimately surprised if I tell them any of this, because their impression was that non-binary is just what some people call themselves when they don't conform to gender roles. Or that it's just about changing name, pronouns and clothes.\n\nI feel like for non-binary to be accepted and understood by most people, there needs to be an actual definition of what it means to be non-binary. The definition can leave room for some ambiguity around the edges, but surely there must be experiences that are *definitely not non-binary.* To me, the criteria for diagnosis of gender dysphoria in the DSM-5 seem like a very reasonable definition.\n\nEven for people who believe that anyone can be any gender as long as they identify as that gender, it's really short-sighted to ban all discourse about this topic. I think the vast majority of trans people come into the community with some amount of transphobia that we learn growing up. I certainly did. I even admit that my discomfort with people calling themselves non-binary with no dysphoria or desire for transition *could be* just another layer of transphobia to peel back. For me, the best way to unlearn transphobia has always been to see people pick apart transphobic beliefs with good reasoning. The reasoning doesn't always have to be 'fAcTs AnD lOgIC' - appealing to being a kind person can work too. I think it would be much better to allow these discussions to happen under moderator supervision. By shutting down all discussions about anything remotely truscum-like, I think the people who run these communities are removing one of the best tools trans people have to unlearn transphobia.\n\nSo I guess this post makes me truscum?", "date": "2019-04-26 05:25:53", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bhio4z/i_feel_caught_in_a_very_awkward_spot_as_a/", "author": "trains_throwaway"}, {"title": "Thinking of leaving the trans community but have nowhere else to go for advice/support", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-04-26 09:12:52", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bhk8ut/thinking_of_leaving_the_trans_community_but_have/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "\ud83e\udd14", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-04-26 14:36:18", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bhmzxv/_/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Do you think the entire \u201cEgg IRL\u201d thing is leading to more of these tucute transtrenders?", "text": "The logic is stupid to begin with.

They ended up collecting around 50.000 signatures that they could send to our minister of equality who then decided that transgenderism should be removed from the list of mental illnesses at the end of 2016. \n\nHeres what I have against that: \n\n1. The way Amnesty International decided that having transgenderism on the list of mental illnesses was transphobic and degrading.\n   1. Nobody really knows who started the idea that having transgenderism on the list of mental illnesses was transphobic and degrading, but from what they published as the background for the decision it's clear that there were only about 5 trans people involved. 5 FUCKING PEOPLE! \n   2. Apart from the small number of trans people involved the campaign did not feature any other form of backup eg. doctors and scientist. They didn't even have any papers or science to support the statement that having transgenderism on the list of mental illnesses was transphobic and degrading. \n   3. That means that this whole campaign was run and supported by around 5 trans people and a handful of other \"progressive\" people. Great. \n2. The lack of information to the people collecting signatures. \n   1. In Denmark, it's very common to have a small local Amnesty International group at your high school. This group will from time to time be in charge of petitions and other pop up stuff. These people were also in charge of most of the petitions held (qualified guess, these local groups was responsible for around 70% of the total signatures collected.) \n   2. These groups did not receive any other information other than what you could get out of the flyers they were sent. The front of the flyers was decorated with the title of the campaign \"#sick system\" and on the inside the held a couple of personal stories told by trans people. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the people responsible for the petitions were not informed enough to know what would actually happen if transgenderism was removed from the list of mental illnesses. \n3. The way the petitions were held.\n   1. The petitions were held at high schools. 15-18-year-old people are not capable of taking a decision like this, most probably don't care tbh, but if told that \"signature = piece of cake\" most will sign anyways. \n4. Progressive = good. \n   1. When this petition was held a lot of people my age would perceive something progressive as better. I don't know why, but my guess is that saying no to something \"progressive\" were connected with conservative people and people who didn't have an open mind.\n5. Our minister of equality was in no position to take this kind of decision. \n   1. I swear, this minister probably went like \"oh they want this? Alright, let's do it\". She probably didn't, but she was in no place to take this decision. Like shes minister of equality for god's sake, this has nothing to do with equality? A decision like this should not be taken by a random politician who hopes to score some of the younger people's votes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI signed the petition. I regret it till this day, but I did. There's even a fucking picture of me mid signature.\n\nI have always connected Amnesty Internation with human rights and I've always thought that they were the good guys who, with the help of petitions, got human rights activist out of prison and stuff like that. I honestly thought we were making a difference for transgender people. We were not. \n\nBeing trans today in Denmark sucks. As far as my knowledge goes this is what an average trans person has to fight with.\n\n1. Absurd waitlists.\n   1. Because transgenderism no longer is a mental illness you are no longer covered by the treatment guarantee which is used to make sure that you receive treatment/elucidation within 30 days. This means that waitlist to get hormones and surgery is crazy. \n   2. You can't go anywhere else in Denmark to receive treatment, so you either have to deal with the waitlist or go to Germany (this only applies to surgery tho)\n2. Outdated methods. \n   1. Before you'll get anywhere near hormones the clinic needs to see pictures of you throughout your life. Did you were a lot of pink dresses when you were 5? Yeah, then you cant be a transman. \n   2. The clinic also needs to speak to your parents (if your older or just lucky they will settle for your partner). If your parents are against you transitioning, you might not get hormones. How fucked up is that?\n   3. You'll probably first end up on hormones after 2-3 years anyway. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe lists go on, but I think you have the picture.\n\nWith these things happening here, seeing non-dysphoric tucutes receive hormones after a few months makes my blood boil. People with beliefs like tucutes made it hell to be a trans person in Denmark. \n\nDon't let this happen to your system.\n\n\\- Levi", "date": "2019-04-27 21:26:38", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bi3tg6/my_country_has_demedicalized_transgenderism_and/", "author": "AdorableSalad"}, {"title": "Just a reminder that TERFs are trash!", "text": "You need dysphoria to be trans, and TERFs are just as stupid as tucutes.", "date": "2019-04-28 00:38:12", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bi5nd8/just_a_reminder_that_terfs_are_trash/", "author": "4grant3d"}, {"title": "Where did the idea come from that you don\u2019t have to be dysphoric to be trans?", "text": "Does anyone know why people believe this?

I bring this here because I wonder if anyone has been through a similar experience, and the nature of it would probably spark argument on another sub lol. Now, it was absolutely intended to be nice because there isn't a malicious bone in this person, so I was being introduced to her for like a 2nd or 3rd time with another friend of mine ((were calling her G)) (who ironically i've known since 2nd grade and have maintained a close enough friendship with to where she listens to be bitch about trans things lol) I've had previous reassurance from G that the only people in her life that know about my trans status were in her life at a point where I showed back up (i moved out of town in middle school) and she had to explain why the stories shes told still apply under this different name and pronoun lol. A wasn't in her life at that point, and while her boyfriend is aware having known G in middle school, I guarantee it's nothing he is telling her. So given that knowledge and the trust I have with G and our mutual friends, I wasnt sure how to respond or what to do in that situation. It was nothing malicious and or even having to do with word of mouth. It was as simple as being clocked as not cis, and someone trying to be respectful because of such. With all of this being said, I present like, pretty binary. At the time I had more of a gym shorts and T shirt look going but having been out almost half as long as I've been alive so on top of being kind of a hick lol, it takes no extended thought process to present masculine or be clocked as such. (ie i have an extremely deep voice, a standard \"short\" size and shape for cis males, and i pretty much just unironically wear camo and chevy hats sorry) but I do have long hair simply out of laziness and being unwilling to justify spending money on cutting my hair when i can just put it in a bun through my hat and never think about it. I'm also stout and pre op, and unwilling to bind anymore for various reasons. Moving on from my appearance, \"A\" first used a they pronoun on me after we had been hanging out for a while and made our way into G's room to look at kittens her cat had. Up until that point there was obviously no real time to use pronouns because there were some cute ass fucking kittens in the house, there was no time for communication besides me needing to be reminded of where I had met this human before lol. G is a notoriously messy human which is fine because I grew up white trash, and I also have a relationship with her where the idea of seeing her sex toys in a box isn't as bizarre as it is helpful for my relationship with my wife, and I did happen to know about a history between G's relationship and A's relationship getting freaky and crossing paths so I knew that at least that they had spoken about banging. So I took the arm and asked my friend G about her tail butt plug that was sitting right there and we had a full blown conversation in front of her friend about girth and prices and quality and shit. So it was like DIRECTLY after that point where I was misheard like twice in a row because I'm type soft spoken and G just can't process, A spoke up for me and repeated what I was saying for me or emphasized my point in different words perhaps agreeing with various points, you know standard conversation stuff, and consistently used they pronouns, for the rest of the duration of us hanging out. Its literally been like two years since this shit happened and I've chilled with this girl mad times since and I'm pretty sure shes just using male pronouns for me because I've vaguely \"accidentally\" bitched about trans issues in front of her (am i mad borderline? lol) and shes just generally less inclined to please people so that probably helps, but I still think about that shit because it was the first time it had been made dysphoric about a they pronoun, and it really admittedly shook my masculinity.

The situation was actually dangerous. Getting back to civilization felt pretty euphoric but after few days I just felt like I normally do. I got similar feeling after top surgery for example. Or was it more like extreme relief?\n\nI feel better now that I am on T, have had top surgery and got out of the woods but it's normal life now. My friend with ADD got meds and she is now happy since she can actually function but it's not \"euphoria\". \n\nI just don't understand how gender euphoria would work without dysphoria. I also don't know if I have experienced gender euphoria at all. Maybe it really has just been a great relief. Maybe I just don't get it. \n\nAnd how does that work in the long term?", "date": "2019-05-03 13:18:18", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bk8e85/i_struggle_to_understand_gender_euphoria/", "author": "ChimneyShrimp"}, {"title": "ftm athletes", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-05-03 17:01:31", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bkas9o/ftm_athletes/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Increased Chest Dysphoria", "text": "I've recently been binding a lot more frequently.

The thing is, he did so after spending a few months in r/egg_irl and now suddenly is claiming he has dysphoria, despite having told me not even a week ago that he still \"loves his dick and chest and doesn't want any surgery or hormones or anything\".\nI've tried telling him that hey, you can, ya know, be a cis boy and still be feminine, like that's a thing. But he's now convinced that he's trans. \nI want to be supportive if he actually IS trans, and he even said that him knowing that I'm here for him and will support him no matter what gave him a lot of confidence and helped him realize he's trans. He's only been describing social dysphoria however, and I don't want to encourage him if it's just some tucute shit.\nIdk, do any of you have advice on how to handle this situation? I don't want to be a dick and tell him he's not trans outright, bc for all I know he genuinely does have diagnosable dysphoria and really did just come to terms from seeing stuff like that.\n\nEdit: I'm a trans guy myself, was diagnosed with dysphoria when I was 14, and the diagnosis has stayed consistent for the past 6 years with me getting ready to start T within the year. 100% understand that yes, he could definitely have dysphoria and actually be trans, but what he has described to me so far doesn't sound like it; it sounds honestly like he just wants to be a feminine boy, not that he's trans, but then again I'm not a psychologist and only have my own research and my own experience with dysphoria to compare, so I'm not trying to say he is not trans for a fact. I more so wanna be able to know how to go about this situation in the best way possible for the both of us (aka not encouraging him if it is just him not understanding what being trans actually is and if he's really just GNC, or how to properly help him with this situation since I want to he there for him as his friend whether he's cis or trans bc I know how important that support is and I don't want to push him away.\nI just don't want him doing something he'll regret or making decisions that could harm him if he's not really trans [we live in a small, rural area and the people here, especially his family, are really anti-LGBT, so I don't want to see him destroy relationships or opportunities or to make himself a target if he isn't actually LGBT bc trust me I know that that shit sucks]).

With multiple comorbid mental illnesses overlapping with one another too, it\u2019s hard to contain my emotions.\n\nI didn\u2019t ask to be born with gender dysphoria. I didn\u2019t ask to live life in excruciating emotional and mental agony from the pain of dysphoria as well as other issues. My dysphoria has caused me so many emotional issues as well- everything from jealousy, rage and profound sadness to extreme suicidality.\n\nBut some people don\u2019t understand this. It doesn\u2019t happen much anymore, but I used to always be sent articles about trans people (and, worse, tucute material and people totally missing the idea of what gender dysphoria is). All of a sudden, once you\u2019re diagnosed with dysphoria you\u2019re automatically permanently linked to the entire \u201cLGBT\u201d community?\n\nSide vent: I cringe whenever I hear \u201cLGBT.\u201d I nearly pull a muscle cringing when I hear something like \u201cLGBTQIA+\u201d because I just feel like it\u2019s becoming a joke at this point. PLUS, sexuality and gender dysphoria HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH EACH OTHER. I\u2019M SICK OF PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT SEXUALITY WHENEVER I BRING UP GENDER DYSPHORIA. People with gender dysphoria and people with different sexualities have much different struggles. Being trans is like a curse. So, I just say \u201cLGB\u201d community and \u201cT\u201d community (though I don\u2019t see the need to be in a \u201ccommunity;\u201d no one else with a medical condition is automatically placed into, or, actually, forced into, a community).\n\nI have removed myself from the \u201ccommunity\u201d entirely. I don\u2019t identify as a trans man, I identify as a man. Hell, half of the people in my life right now (with the exception of romantic partners and family, obviously) don\u2019t even know I\u2019m trans. I don\u2019t feel like posting this on a throwaway, but some people I know are familiar with my Reddit account (so, if you\u2019re one of my friends that doesn\u2019t know, I\u2019m sorry you had to find out this way). I prefer to live stealth because I honestly find the condition itself to be embarrassing and makes me feel less like a man.\n\nHOWEVER, I\u2019ve gotten angry messages from friends who insist I SHOULD be thinking this and that and that they\u2019re confused and that my opinions \u201cmake no sense whatsoever\u201d and are \u201ccontradictory\u201d and that I must hate myself for having the opinions that I do. (Though isn\u2019t that kind of transphobic to force all trans people to believe certain things?)\n\nIf I was cis, I\u2019d just shrug it off and it wouldn\u2019t even be a problem in the first place. But nope, had to be born trans. It makes dating so difficult, and I also can\u2019t seem to find a middle ground between ultra conservatives who believe trans people don\u2019t exist VS tucutes and the 1000000000 genders people. Over the years, I\u2019ve drifted more toward the Right (socially and politically slightly), and have become a massive fan of Blaire White and all the other YouTubers similar to her. But I can barely find anyone who would accept me under both circumstances (me being trans but having beliefs many trans people don\u2019t have).\n\nAnyway, I could go on for miles here but let\u2019s get to the nitty gritty of it all: The existence of tucutes is worsening my depression and, quite honestly, making me suicidal.\n\nThey make being trans look like a lovely walk in the park and that it\u2019s some kind of choice. And heaven forbid you disagree with them or else you\u2019re \u201cnot really trans\u201d and \u201cjust a bigot\u201d (which is actually extremely hypocritical of them to say but whatever).\n\nI saw a post the other day on some subreddit making fun of people like us who actually want trans people to be validated and get rid of the tucutes by educating them. It was a group of tucutes anyway. I believe it was r/transgendercirclejerk but I could be wrong; really don\u2019t wanna go back to that post.\n\nIt\u2019s a good feeling to have a large group of people agree that you ABSOLUTELY 110% DO NEED GENDER DYSPHORIA TO BE TRANS but it\u2019s the worst feeling ever knowing there are even more people out there that believe otherwise and try to push that onto others, which in turn feeds \u201ctraditional\u201d transphobia.\n\nI\u2019m 20 now. Got on hormones at 17, after YEARS of being in the agony of gender dysphoria which was worsened without it. I got top surgery at the age of 18. But I had to fight for it, hard. My parents denied it, and I think they even took me to another therapist once one of them diagnosed me with gender dysphoria (only for all the other therapists and doctors to diagnose me too, lol) but I didn\u2019t get an official diagnosis until the summer of 2014. Do you know how f-ing painful that was and how long I had to wait?\n\nThere USED TO BE strict guidelines and regulations. 2 years of living as that gender, a note from a psychologist (I think more than one, actually), and a bunch of other things. You had to jump through millions of hoops just to be treated for this awful thing. So I had to FIGHT for it, and I fought hard. Wanted to kill myself so bad throughout it all. (Not to bring religion into this, but I\u2019d like to mention the only reason why I\u2019m still alive is because I\u2019m a Christian and fear going to Hell.)\n\nI see photos of myself before coming out and I cringe so hard. My therapist even saw a photo of me from just before I came out, and she noticed that my eyes looked deeply sad and pained and that my smile was 110% forced. That\u2019s something I hadn\u2019t noticed before. But it\u2019s true. I was suffering. Still am, but back then my dysphoria had me in a chokehold. Again, it still does, but not being able to do anything about being constantly misgendered and being denied hormones and surgery, watching my male peers go through puberty while I was missing out on it, it was all torturous and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. Back then, it was very hush-hush and I basically had to just live a lie.\n\nCase in point: I fought hard for everything: my hormones, my name change, my surgery, everything. But it seems like now ANYONE can walk into a doctors office and say \u201chi I want to start HRT\u201d and they just shrug their shoulders and say \u201ctotally! Here, have fun with that!\u201d without any kind of check. Nowadays, I\u2019m sure if they turned anyone down they\u2019d probably be labeled some kind of transphobe. Cis people could easily go and get hormones and surgery, it seems. What the F happened to the regulations and guidelines?!?!?! Why did I have to fight and these people just walk into a clinic and request hormones and almost immediately they\u2019re on them? It\u2019s not fair.\n\nI know a trender. It makes my blood boil even looking at her. I mean, she also believes she\u2019s famous, is a HUGE attention whore and wants to always be seen as a victim or something, is highly delusional and she\u2019s by far the most obnoxious individual I know. But, above all that, she pretends to be trans. That makes her so much worse in my eyes. I have a special kind of rage toward trenders and tucutes.\n\nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just kind of fed up right now. I\u2019m sick of the expectations and I\u2019m so, so sick of trenders and tucutes making the genuine suffering of trans people into a trend. Honestly depressed and suicidal. (No, I\u2019m not gonna do anything; I just FEEL really awful.)\n\nThanks for listening. Sorry if anything came out the wrong way or if something didn\u2019t make sense.

The transgender suicide rate is around 40%, and the stress from it can lead to all sorts of other mental disorders on top of that. But because it sucks so much to be transgender, and because it relies so heavily on self-identification, it's attracted a lot of non-trans people with [Munchhausen syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factitious_disorder_imposed_on_self).\n\nThis is a huge problem in the trans community. The goal of actual trans people is greater acceptance, but the goal of these Munchhausen types is to be oppressed as much as possible. Like, they actively seek out oppression, so they can play the victim, and get sympathy or whatever. As a result, they act like [complete tools](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/not-for-men-sorry-transgender-woman-files-human-rights-complaint-after-being-denied-brazilian-wax), and make the rest of us look terrible by comparison, in their quest for oppression as a means of gaining sympathy.\n\nAs someones who's actually MtF transgender, I can recognize these types a mile away, but there's no single defining trait that you can recognize them by. So I put together a list of criteria similar to the way the DSM (psychology diagnostic manual) diagnoses other mental disorders. \n\n#Criteria for transgender-specific factitious disorder imposed on self:\n\nThese criteria are less important, and each one adds +1 to their score:\n\n* Little interest in clothing and makeup, for MtF trans-identifying.\n* Hates Jordan Peterson with a passion.\n* Uses the term \"dysphoria\" in really nonspecific contexts.\n* Is not on hormones, and has no interest in ever going on hormones.\n\nThese criteria are moderately indicative, and add +2 to their score:\n\n* Little to no interest in support groups.\n* Comes out really publicly, as opposed to gradually.\n* Prefers to air all their transgender-related thoughts publicly, in a way that's easily tied to their real-life identity, on social media or on a blog.\n* Has filed transgender discrimination lawsuits, or talks a lot about filing them.\n\nThese criteria are *strongly* indicative, and add +3 to their score:\n\n* Complains a lot about transgender oppression.\n* Identifies more strongly as \"trans\" than as any gender.\n* Seemingly no sense of shame.\n* No sense of humor, or a very rehearsed sense of humor.\n\nBasically, you calculate the maximum possible score, and if they score over half of that, then they're probably faking it for some reason or other. It's often assumed they know they're faking it, but I truly don't think they do. They have a genuine mental disorder: factitious disorder imposed on self. They subconsciously convince themselves they're transgender, then start acting the way they think a transgender person would act. And the more people that self-identify as transgender that are like them, the more that validates them and makes their Munchhausen syndrome harder to identify.\n\nThere's a school of thought that's common in the transgender community, that anyone who identifies as transgender, *is*. But that's patently absurd. Identifying as transgender doesn't make it so, any more than identifying as *not* transgender can make it go away. Another complicating factor is that *actual* transgender people typically want to socially transition so they can live their lives inconspicuously, just as the opposite sex. These Munchhausen types, on the other hand, gravitate towards highly-visible activist positions.

It almost always goes in the FtM direction, since girls tend to be less valued by most cultures, and are physically weaker than boys.\n\nFor example, if a girl's father isn't shy about the fact that he wishes he had a son, she's very likely to experience gender dysphoria without actually being transgender. Same with a girl who is really good at sports, and resents the fact that she knows that no matter how good she gets, she'll never be able to compete with boys.\n\nUsually, this occurs at younger ages, and goes away eventually, but it's definitely possible for someone to get caught up enough in this transgender identity that they transition when they probably shouldn't.\n\nI feel like gender dysphoria is necessary for being considered transgender, but perhaps not sufficient. I mean, gender dysphoria just means \"unhappiness with your gender\", which doesn't really get to the root of the problem. The *real* problem is obviously an incongruence between the genders of the brain and body, which then in turn causes the symptom of gender dysphoria.\n\nI've tried to come up with other tests that are useful for this purpose, and one that I found was really helpful to me, was imagining yourself in five years, both as male, and as female. Most people have a *much* more fully-formed concept of who they'd like to be as one sex than the other, and have a much stronger positive attraction to the idea of being that sex.

Keep in mind I'm just a high school AP student, nowhere near super skilled. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Transgender Youth And Medical Transition**\n\nNearly two percent of teenagers living in the US are transgender, yet the identity and the disorder behind it are often widely misunderstood (Strauss). This misunderstanding often leads to harassment and bullying, adding to the internal struggles that trans teens already face. The combination of struggling with living in the wrong sex\u2019s body and the discrimination from those who don\u2019t take their identity seriously leads to a troublingly high suicide rate. Allowing children to transition not only socially but also medically tackles the root of the problem before it can develop into something more dangerous and possibly deadly. \n\nTransition is seen as an all in one, permanent, shocking thing. When people think of transition, they look to celebrities such as Caitlyn Jenner, who underwent complete sexual reassignment and plastic surgeries. However, medical transition comes in many forms, some even reversible. For those who haven\u2019t gone through puberty, or have just started, hormone blockers are a viable option: blockers are injections that prevent the body from producing the sex hormone of either estrogen or testosterone, delaying puberty. These blockers are fully reversible, so if the child or teen discovers that they aren\u2019t truly transgender (which is a fear many parents have), they can easily stop taking the blockers, and go through their biological puberty (McGuire). Delaying puberty prevents the child from going through what is a sometimes traumatic experience; those identifying as male but biologically female forced to develop breasts and get a menstrual cycle, those identifying as female but biologically male forced to listen to their voice drop, and develop facial hair. Trying to present as one gender, while your body defies you, contributes massively to the rates of harassment and sometimes even suicide. Of the two percent of transgender teens in the US, thirty percent have attempted to end their lives (Dean). You see yourself as one thing, while the rest of the world sees you as the opposite. The complete reversibility of hormone blockers makes them a reasonable and safe way to start someone's transition, as it both makes the child happy for the time being and takes the fear of permanent decision away from parents if they\u2019re uncertain about the validity of the child's identity or condition, and if it might fluctuate in the future . \n\nCross-sex hormones, also called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), are administered to those with gender dysphoria in order to correct the body\u2019s physical and even some mental characteristics. HRT does exactly what the name implies; replaces the hormones with the ones of the desired sex, in order to put the body through the proper puberty. Those born biologically female will go through male puberty, those born biologically male will go through female puberty. Hormones offer the opportunity to align the body with the mind, changing the outside to match the inside. A review of recent studies suggests we could start cross-sex hormones as early as fourteen so that transgender kids don't suffer the stigma of starting puberty years after their classmates (Turban). Allowing for teens and pre-teens to follow along with their peers eliminates the threat of even more harassment or bullying due to their identities and appearances.\n\nThose who think children shouldn\u2019t transition often believe that the feeling of being transgender is just that, a feeling. In reality, the condition behind those feelings, gender dysphoria, is very real. Gender dysphoria is the disconnect between biological sex and the mind, and the distress that comes with that disconnect (Dean). It is often believed that transgender people are simply mentally ill, and the focus should be on \u201ccuring\u201d or \u201cfixing\u201d the disconnect through conversion therapy or other methods. The international evidence, however, is very clear: transgender people cannot be \u201ccured.\u201d It is the attempt to align their gender with their physical sex that can lead to distress, but not aligning it leads to even more issues (McGuire).  Just like any other condition, whether medical or physical, it needs to be treated in the way best suited to the individual. In the case of transgender individuals, this treatment is to seek out transition to their true identity, whether that be through taking cross-sex hormones, breast augmentation or removal, genital reassignment surgery, or just wearing different clothing. \n\nJust like any other child, transgender children deserve to have what makes them happy and healthy. Though their requests and needs may not be traditional, at the end of the day they are essential to them having a good life. Allowing children, including teenagers, to start their transitions earlier in life makes for an easier transition later on in life, and letting them go through with their transition earlier with hormones and puberty blockers can prevent the need for future surgeries and procedures, along with preventing the discrimination and danger that comes with not passing as the desired, true sex. For transgender youth, transitioning can be the difference between life and death. \n\n**Works Cited**\n\n*Dean, Jamie. \"Suffer the Children.\" World Magazine, Apr. 2017.

I'm using this subreddit as a truscum-friendly alternative to mainstream transgender subs.\n\nIt blows my mind that there are so many people who believe in a very specific God, angels, afterlives, and the power of prayer, but don't believe in other people's self-reported thoughts and feelings. It is insanity to believe these incredible things and then to emotionally neglect your child because their self-reported feelings don't jive with your purely faith-based beliefs, which are only as justified as all the other religious beliefs in the world. I cannot believe how much harm so many religious people are willing to cause LGBT people when they claim that faith is a virtue, but they don't believe in other people's inner worlds.\n\nI was raised conservative Catholic. I cannot believe the harm my parents and fellow churchgoers were willing to do to me. I cannot believe they immersed me in a culture that I'd have to leave behind later. You don't just leave church, advent, Lent, saint days, and all that stuff behind when your parents fused it to your childhood. It feels like you're going into exile when that's the only world you know. I can't believe my mom decided to scold me instead of taking me to a psychologist when I told her I wanted to be a boy. I cannot believe that my parents were rabidly pro-life but would rather have ruined LGBT children's lives than reflect on their beliefs for even a few seconds. I cannot believe the conservative Christian adults I couldn't turn to for refuge in public schools. Most people in the American deep south really make me sick. They cannot use ignorance as an excuse if they have internet access. I cannot believe people's unwillingness to inform themselves in the Information Age, even at the cost of other people's happiness. \n\nI cannot comprehend what it's like to be so brain-dead that you don't make the connection between medically transitioning and suffering. I can't believe people who think it's a casual lifestyle choice. I cannot comprehend believing that your brand of religion is the cure for society's ills when you are obviously ruining people's lives. I cannot comprehend believing that you are right but carefully avoiding information that might change your opinion; it indicates that you don't really believe you're right. If you are willing to ruin people's lives to fit in with your church buddies, knowing deep down that there's something off about what you're doing, I don't know what to call that besides evil. \n\nI cannot believe how evil the average person down here seems to be. I can't believe that a Christian nurse interrogated me with the self-reported aim of knowing how to prevent her daughter from becoming like me. I can't believe that I had to drop out of my previous college because a professor wouldn't use male pronouns. I can't believe that my psychiatrist, for crying out loud, asked me if I believed in God after I told her I was transgender. \n\nI cannot believe that people think this type of religion is a force of good in the world. It makes me sick to my stomach, and I find myself unable to simply live and let live. I watch heterosexual, cisgender, conservative Christians enjoy their religions with bitter resentment because I know that they think their way of living is right for me, and they are not willing to get to know me so they can see how wrong they are. They know subconsciously that their beliefs rest on shaky ground; that's why they get so defensive and passive aggressive about them, and that's why they don't seek out new information. They don't care if people like me end up in inescapable poverty and misery because of the actions of people like them. That level of intellectual cowardice is incredible to me. There is no better word for it than evil. I cannot believe what people have done to me and are still willing to do because they're pathetic cowards who are afraid of thinking about something new for even five seconds.", "date": "2019-05-09 16:31:33", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bmlwzo/conservative_christianity_still_haunts_me_as_an/", "author": "daftmunk"}, {"title": "lots of transphobia in our own community.

Pride is exciting because I'm gay. While they seem to not make any difference with my visibility (I should get a big blinking sign) I'm almost always sporting a rainbow somewhere.

I've just been running so many things through my head today and managed to stress myself out. \n\nI've been trying to work out my feelings on bottom surgery and if it's even possible for me. It shouldn't be something I'm thinking too heavily on and stressing over rn. I haven't even gotten top surgery yet. Hell, I haven't even gotten surgeries I need to function on a day to day basis because the American healthcare system is absolute garbage. Bottom surgery is important, but other things take priority for me.\n\nI've mentioned on here before that my bottom dysphoria centers around having any genitals at all. My current junk has felt deeply wrong since childhood, but I don't want a penis either. I pack occasionally, but it isn't so I can look/feel like I have a dick, it's moreso to help me feel like I don't have a vagina, and I quickly tend to forget there's a dick in my pants, so I just feel like there's nothing down there. I know that sounds stupid, but that's about the only way I can explain it.\n\nBottom surgery, is so daunting to me and the stress that comes from weighing my options if what I want is ever a possibility just leaves me exhausted. \"Nullo\" surgeries are typically done on men, or possibly other amab individuals, and while there isn't a lot of info, it's still out there. I've heard afabs can have them done, but I've never found a single case of one, and I've never heard of a single surgeon willing to do the procedure. A lot of people have recommended i just have a vaginectomy and clitoral release, but that's just not quite what I'm looking for.\n\nI'm also struggling with how it could change my sex life. I do experience pretty bad dysphoria during PIV sex, and I know there are plenty of other ways to have sex, but it's still, dysphoria aside, the most enjoyable for me by far. I know I shouldn't let sexual reasons influence me to not transition, just as people shouldn't transition for sexual reasons, but I still feel like no matter what I choose if surgery is ever an option, I'll regret it.

A few common tells, for being MtF transgender, but overall feminine in appearance. Wears women's jeans and v-neck t-shirt. It's implied she's had SRS.\n\n**Xanadu Starscream:** Titular character. (straight cis man throws on a wig and a dress and becomes TRANS LESBIAN WOMAN, seeker of oppression!) Short and kinda scrawny, and looks decidedly male. Has stubble that she doesn't bother to conceal. Wears an ill-fitting super-short tube dress that can't support her DD breast forms, and platform stilettos. Has a wig that does *not* match her natural hair cover, and her hair is always poking out from under it.

This is kind of a weird thing I've been dealing with for awhile but more intensely this past week.\n\nI'm pre T. I have my first appointment with a doctor in a month. I'm excited but I'm also doubting this.\n\nI've known I was trans for a long time. I knew I wanted to be a boy before I really knew that transitioning is a thing. My dysphoria is intense and has stopped me from doing a lot of things in my life. I've always told myself that if I were cis, even if I were a cis girl, I'd be farther along in my career and life in general. Dysphoria holds me back.\n\nBut I find myself doubting it all. Do I really want to have to come out to my grandma, my sister, and the rest of my family? Do I really want to inject myself with hormones? Do I really want to change my name and gender marker?\n\nObviously, yes. But I'm still in denial I guess.\n\nI can't imagine living my life as a woman. But it's also hard to imagine it as a man. (I'm not non binary. I'm definitely binary ftm). I guess I just never thought I'd get this far. I never seriously contemplated  suicide. I've had passing thoughts of \"if I don't wake up tomorrow, it's no big deal\".\n\nI think I'm just afraid to be happy. It sounds so dramatic and stupid but I think that's it. I don't remember ever being truly happy and I think the thought of it freaks me out. But what's worse than being happy is not being happy. Right now, I can blame my dysphoria for my sadness. But once I transition and my dysphoria isn't so bad, what if I'm still sad? \n\nI know that's not really that bad, I could go to therapy or whatever and try to fix it. I really don't like therapy though. I think I'm afraid of uncovering some issues I buried. I don't have the greatest relationship with my dad. We live in different states and only talk once every few months. I like it that way. But I think my \"daddy issues\" have more of an impact on me than I'd like to admit. I tend to push people away and never really talk about my emotions (except online bc anonymity is great).\n\nI know that transitioning is what I want, what I need. I think I'm just scared of change. \n\n**TL;DR I think I'm afraid of being happy. I know I need to transition but I'm afraid of change. My life as it is now isn't that great, I don't ever do anything meaningful. I might be trying to sabotage myself and still be trying to convince myself I'm not trans. I am trans, I have dysphoria. Anyone else feel this way? I'm so close to being where I need to be but I'm terrified. I always get this way though. I've never made a decision without immediately regretting it even though it's the right thing. It might just be anxiety. Idk.

Then I proceeded to reveal to her that she was, in fact, cisgender.\n\nI know that I can't possibly experience this person's gender identity, but if you don't have gender incongruence, gender dysphoria or identify as trans then you are not trans, and if you're not trans then you're cisgender, it's not that black and white but that's a pretty good sum up.\n\nOr when I came out to my cousins, both of them said that they were non-binary, so then I asked what steps they were taking to embrace and embody their non-binary gender identity, how their coming out as nb went and what pronouns I should use, the response was silence. Same thing happened recently with someone who mentioned that she didn't identify as binary.\n\nNow this is why I mentioned that these (cis, binary) people usually have good intentions when saying these wrongly stated things: they just mean that they're gender non-comforming and that they don't want to perpetuate binary gender stereotypes. That's perfect, that's good, so then say that you're gender non-conforming, don't say that you're not cis because GNC is still not trans and don't say that you're non binary because GNC is not non binary.\n\nThe reason why it bothers me so much is because when people who I've known for years and they've never expressed any other gender identity than their cis binary gender claim they're non binary or not cis when they are clearly binary and cis I feel like they're coopting trans and nonbinary identities and are undervaluing the struggles and experiences of us people who actually live those realities.\n\nIt's like when a cishet white dude says \"I don't feel privileged\", I mean, okay, but you clearly are, it's just that you're so immersed in it that you don't even realize it. Only the fish that swims against the stream realizes that water exists, all of the others have no idea that they're surrounded by water.\n\nIt's like that, these people have no idea of their gender because they don't really go against gender norms like trans and nonbinary people do, they're swimming with the stream so they have no idea how much their cisgender binary identities surround their world and they can ignorantly claim that they're not cis or binary.\n\nI know they're just ignorant and they have no better words to express it but it annoys me that suddenly everyone is claiming that they're not cis or binary because I'm seeing that it's becoming trendy to claim those thing and that undermines the struggles, experiences and fights of actual nonbinary and trans people and I hate that it's become this way, even if these people have good intentions.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nThat was the original post, though I do want to add that while I'm binary I do believe there are non-binary trans people and that they're trans, I don't know what that experience is like but I think it's just the same as cis people not understanding trans people, I don't get nb people but I don't have to, I just have to respect them.", "date": "2019-05-13 11:08:47", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bo238l/first_post_on_asktg_also_first_post_removed/", "author": "trendertrannylife"}, {"title": "gc2b binder rubbing", "text": "I\u2019ve been wearing my gc2b half binder almost everyday and I notice that I\u2019m starting to have friction burn marks around my armpit area.

I'm not sure Peterson completely understands the distinction, but he does draw one. He refers to them as \"activists\", because let's be honest, almost all trans activists *are* trenders. He also repeatedly makes the point that they don't have the right to speak for all trans people, and compares them to Maoists and Bolsheviks. And after reading [this sticky post](https://redd.it/bislhq) in /r/asktransgender, the comparison between the two groups seems *really* obvious. To them, group identity is paramount, and there can be no greater sin than invalidating someone's identity. Obviously this is wrong, so they need to use thought policing to get their way. Hence the insistence that people report each other for minor or questionable violations of the rules. They also believe they can dictate what's true and what's not, regardless of evidence. Hence the \"(and, y'know, the truth)\" in the title.\n\nOf course, trenders *hate* that he's trying to divide the trans community, so they spread all sorts of rumors about him.

So here's an analogy that might make sense to people:\n\nLet's say you have Tourette's syndrome, and have dealt with it your whole life. You've struggled with having difficulty controlling your tics in public, and acting awkward around other people. It causes you a lot of stress, but despite all that, you've been able to lead a reasonably productive life. You've gone to Tourette's support groups, and they've been helpful to you in knowing that you're not alone.\n\nThen at some point, a YouTube rapper with Tourette's syndrome becomes really popular. His stuff is weird, but it has a certain appeal to it, and honestly he's really talented and original. A lot of people want to emulate him now. People start saying *they* have these uncontrollable urges too now, and talk about how \"random\" and \"Tourette's\" they are. At one point, a guy shows up to your support group throwing f-bombs and n-bombs right and left, and explains it by saying \"that's just how Tourette's I am\".\n\nYou've always been really embarrassed about your Tourette's syndrome, and just wanted it to be a minimal part of who you are, but now everyone and his brother thinks he's \"Tourette's\" whenever he does anything impulsive, or can't control himself in public.\n\nThis bothers you at first, but not *that* much. But then you start noticing that all these \"Tourette's activists\" start being featured more and more in the news and on social media. They're advocating for their right, as self-identified Tourette's syndrome sufferers, to act antisocial whenever they want to. They claim society is oppressing them for their alternate psychological configurations, and that society should allow them to say anything to anyone at any time, and to do otherwise would be \"touretphobic\".\n\nTheir agenda is pretty transparent to most of society, and you start hearing from people claiming that Tourette's syndrome isn't even a real thing; that it's just an excuse people use to get attention and act like assholes in public. Finally, you decide it's time to speak up.\n\nYou say that many of these people who claim to have Tourette's actually don't, and that they're just pretending to because they think it's cool and want an excuse to ignore society's rules. You're immediately accused of \"invalidating their identities\" and \"gatekeeping\". You can't fathom why anyone would ever *want* to have Tourette's syndrome. It's caused you untold amounts of stress throughout your life, and certainly hasn't been fun for you.\n\nThe Tourette's community has certainly grown in recent years, but now you're actually *excluded* from parts of it, because your views are considered \"hate speech\". Not everyone with Tourette's syndrome shares your views though. Some like that the stigma has been removed, and it's a lot easier for them to be accepted in certain sectors. You have to admit that this has been a benefit, but at the same time, there's been a backlash in certain segments of society, who only know about Tourette's syndrome from seeing highly-visible Tourette's-identifiers acting antisocial.\n\nYou never wanted your struggles to become politicized, but now they have. You'd always just wanted to fit in with everyone else, but now your condition has been appropriated by anyone wanting an excuse to ignore society's expectations of them. And while it's really obvious to *you* who's legitimate and who isn't, that's not obvious at all to outside observers.", "date": "2019-05-18 14:46:37", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bq4qzx/a_hypothetical_analogy_for_how_transmedicalists/", "author": "onegira"}, {"title": "Has anyone thought of how their upbringing might have influenced the way they perceive their gender?", "text": "I would post this on r/ asktransgender but I don't necessarily trust their judgment on a lot of subjects.\n\nI'm what you'd call fairly new to the trans community. I've questioned my gender as long as I can remember and have delt with minor bouts of dysphoria along the way. Not until some months ago I've come to accept myself as ftm transgender and overall my dysphoria has gotten way worse.\n\nBut like a lot of us I still have those moments where I ask myself \"am I really trans?\" \"What if this is just a phase?\"\n\nI was watching an interview with Kalvin Garrah and a detransitioner and they mentioned how many detransitioners believe they should go on to be the opposite gender because they're too masculine/feminine. Now I'm aware that doesn't make someone transgender, but for whatever the reason it's lead me to question my own transness.\n\nSince I could remember I've grown up with a lot of traditionally masculine influences. My uncle used to take me out to collect worms and bugs, I'd wrestle with my dad, play guns with the boys at school, etc. My mom though would still try and encourage me into taking part in more traditionally feminine things, but for the most part I usually rejected most of it. I used to complain as a kid as a result of how I was accedently put in the wrong body and how I was supposed to be a boy.\n\nBasically, I've just been thinking that if I were to grow up differently, having masculinity more discouraged growing up and living amoungst more feminine influences, would I still be transgender? Of course this doesn't account for the strong amount of dysphoria I've felt towards my body since the onset of puberty, but it's still something that's been starting to make me doubt myself.\n\nSo what I'm asking here, has anyone else grown up in a similar way?

I know, I know, you can't pick and choose changes and I'm aware of that, and don't get me wrong, I don't regret ever starting, but I just get stressed about things a lot.\n\nThe main thing I wanted was voice changes, followed closely by fat distribution changes, face changes, and the disappearance of shark week. I was neutral on body hair and bottom growth. Didn't want facial hair at all. I was willing to accept things I didn't want to get things I did want though, and I'm still fairly okay with that. \n\nThe Red Scare ended within a month or two, thank god. I've had some very minor body shape changes, but my voice is the exact same. I've never really had an extremely feminine voice, which is a plus, but it still hasn't changed at all. Meanwhile by around 2 or 3 months I had to shave my face every 3 or 4 days, and now I usually have to daily. I just see everyone taking forever to get things like facial hair and really wanting it, and getting voice drops quickly, and I feel like I got the exact opposite of everyone else. I know everyone experiences the changes differently, and everyone gets different ones at different times, but it's so discouraging seeing everyone else get the ones you NEED for your dysphoria asap while you can't get them at all, and getting the ones you didn't really want almost immediately after starting T. My levels are fine, and there are obvious changes, but I just can't help but be disappointed? I dunno if that makes me sound whiny?\n\nI also just can't help but feel dysphoric about some of the changes. Like, I was fine with bottom growth at first, but as more time goes on, I seem to get more dysphoric about it.

It's obviously a stage they're going through, like in high school, where your personality isn't very developed yet, but you're trying to act like an adult.\n\nLike, other trans women often err on the side of dressing like strippers. Usually this is when they're early in their transition, and I guess they're just getting it out of their system, after having to bottle up their emotions for so long. I'm pretty early in my transition too, and feel like I'm a teenager, and sometimes I have to suppress my inner \"mean girl\". These instincts are real! I keep wanting to say \"OH MY *GOD*! Did you *SEE* what she's *wearing?*\"\n\nTrans men seem to overcompensate by talking like cowboys, or trying to be the center of attention. Or making jokes every chance they get. Since they're usually pretty early in their transition when they're at this overcompensation stage, their voices are still high-pitched. For whatever reason, observing this is hilarious to me. I grew up on a farm where we had chickens, and the roosters would have this awkward adolescent stage where they still looked like hens. This was when they'd first start trying to crow, and they'd be really bad at it at first. You'd think there was something wrong with them, because the sounds would come out all wrong. But all roosters do eventually figure out how to crow, and likewise, trans men get past their awkward stages too.\n\nObviously I don't share these thoughts with them.

In the past, I\u2019ve asked questions on asktg about trans stuff, but I find the tucutes there stifle mature discussion and non-hugbox posts. As a result, I find myself doubtful that I\u2019m trans (because I feel like it\u2019s lost a lot of its meaning). I recognize dysphoria is diagnosable only by medical professionals. Regardless, I\u2019d like to know if my experience is consistent with trans people.\n\n\nI\u2019ll be honest about where I\u2019m at. 18 and AMAB.\n\nI\u2019ve always had fantasies about becoming a girl, even during pre-pubescence\n\nI\u2019ve worn pants and/or shaved body hair and slept in jeans since 14 because my bare legs made me feel uncomfortable\n\nI\u2019ve started voice training, and having a feminine voice makes me grin from ear to ear.\n\nIf I don\u2019t shave for a few days, I feel absolutely rotten and like my face looks freakish\n\nMy hairline, though normal for a guy my age (even lower than normal) freaks me out\n\nI\u2019ve crossdressed a few times and I\u2019ve liked it\n\nI don\u2019t like the parts \u201cdown there\u201d\n\n\nReasons I doubt:\n\nI have a history of anxious behaviors and being overattentive to certain things\n\nI have a history of obsessing about things\n\nI\u2019ve had what I\u2019d characterize as mild Munchausen\u2019s, especially when I was younger.\n\nFor breasts, I don\u2019t know if I have enough experience to know how I feel about them.\n\n\nI don\u2019t trust (ironically) doctors or therapists in my area, because I\u2019m worried they\u2019ll either be super conservative or one of the ones who just don\u2019t gatekeep at all. Which means I might not get the hormones I need, or worse, I might irreversibly damage my body unnecessarily on the advice of a tucute.\n\nSo, I\u2019d like to hear about your experiences. I\u2019d like to be able to judge for myself the most likely route before I make a decision that may change my life for good based on others who have done that and were satisfied.\n\nA side note: I\u2019m sick of the greater trans community.

Share your stories.\n\nI didn't know for the longest time until I went for therapy because I wanted paper allowing me to reduce my breast to basically zero. I was on my breaking point and psychiatrist asked whether I'm trans. I said no, I knew nothing of trans people born female and didn't ever entertain such a thought despite dreaming for years I was a mage and could change my body.\n\nI had it since a kid. I was oddly proud of how big my feet were, how tall I was until boys hit puberty too and mine didn't grow more like their did. My hands were weirdly small to me, taking photos with my hands I always made sure they were in front to look bigger. My breasts made me feel deformed despite a lot of positive attention I got and envy. I planned their removal ever since I can remember and just kept myself sane telling myself it will be over once I'm an adult \\[as in able to get operation\\]. My face/head was too small, my nose too small, my lips not wide enough horizontally, my eyes too doll like. I did not understand why these things were an issue. And I didn't understand why I felt so bad about my light skin made me feel icky about myself despite the praise from goth and emo community ([turns out there is a reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_skin_color) ctrl f 'female'). I loved my body hair and felt bad about how scarce it was on my thighs and arms despite being shamed for it, especially having it on my face. I never minded being chubbier, I cherished it even because I was bigger than a regular woman (and so is my skeleton in width a bit which I was proud), but I do mind having my fat stored on my hips and upper inner thigh more. When I didn't belong among certain women and a man told me I'm unlike other girls I'd instantly turn into a white knight and fight over how women can be anything. I still do. I still have issues getting over how despite my sincerest love for women I can't remain one for my own sanity. It's not about clothes or personality - women can be anything they want and so do men and I'll fight for a society where someone's fashion sense doesn't stigmatize them. I even refused to ever mention my gender nonconformity in ANY way during diagnosis, because I refuse to infantilize women. I just have a tiny part of my brain not recognizing my sex characteristics as right.

I say \"inclusive\", because they're including people in a community where they shouldn't even be, at the expense of the people who actually should be there.\n\nHere in the UK (and in places with a similar setup to the NHS) we can transition basically for free. There's costs for prescriptions and stuff, but it's unbelievable cheap compared to going private. Granted, it takes years to make any progress, but for people who just don't have the money (like myself) it's an absolute godsend regardless. The only reason we can transition for free (as far as I can tell) is because dysphoria is listed as a mental disorder. So just like every other mental disorder, the NHS provides treatment. \n\nPeople who ask for that to change, are fucking so many people over. If it stops being regarded as a mental disorder, most likely treatment will be so much more costly for everyone, because transition will probably just be comparable to plastic surgery. It'll be seen as a choice instead of a need, and so many people won't be able to afford it. Mental issues and suicide rates will probably skyrocket. These people are calling for so many lives to be ruined, based on the fact that they're offended. Not to mention, they're asking for an actual fact to be changed because they don't like it.\n\nTucutes make this worse, because there are plenty who transition to various extents, without dysphoria. People will start to see that you don't need dysphoria to transition, and assume it's not a requirement for being trans. It won't be taken seriously at all because it's just seen as optional for some people. Plus, more people that transition without dysphoria (so they don't need to) will be taking up waiting lists, surgery dates, funds, etc., that people with dysphoria desperately need in order to be content in life, and for some, to stay alive at all. \n\nI was told last week that I'll be waiting around 4 years to start T, minimum. It absolutely fucking broke me and I've been so down since then and have started seeing suicide as less of a \"Will I do it?\" And more of a \"When will I do it? How long can I last?\" Because I just can't handle it. I can't help but wonder how many people on that waiting list don't even have dysphoria, and how much shorter the list would be if they weren't on it.

Thank you for your patience. \n\nI've been lurking around since late March and now I simply want to reach out and ask for advice. I understand that nothing can replace a diagnosis from a professional but I would like to hear your opinion and see if I should dwell on these thoughts further. I think a part of me badly wants someone to say to my face that \"no, you are **not** transgender\" so I can leave it all behind and move on. I'll come back to this later.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI can't remember the first time I wondered if I want to be a man but each and every time I just look into the mirror and say to myself \"nah, I don't hate my current body so I can't be trans.\" Then I would move on... until one day I couldn't. It was late at night, was listening to music and singing along. Then a thought struck me: how cool it would be to be able to sing in a male voice? This wasn't the first time this happens, I've been wanting to do this since I was a teen but something happened. Before I knew it, I was bawling my eyes out. I sobbed into the pillow so that my family can't hear me. \n\nI can't sing or talk like a man, no matter what I do. Even now, I don't understand why it **distressed** me that badly. The realization and emotions hit me like a truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I rushed to the laptop and searched up the symptoms and stories trans people shared. I couldn't relate to most of them. Most said they were very uncomfortable with their body, especially when puberty starts, but as I remembered I was mostly fine with it. I don't actively think much of my body but I do feel nice when someone gives a sincere compliment. I didn't feel that mismatching with my gender either but to be fair, I was treated like a boy up until high school. I was allowed to wear pants instead of dresses to school, had my hair short, very masculine name (which I secretly love a lot), got mistaken for a boy by the teachers quite often (even got assigned to the male dorm once and it's still one of my favourite memories for some odd reasons). Even at home, my sister uses the masculine pronoun for me and I wouldn't want that to change. \n\nThen I was stuck in a cycle of doubt and I still am, tbh. I don't know if my anxiety and this intense longing is a sign of dysphoria. I know the euphoria is very real, although I do not think it's a prerequisite for being transgender. If I don't mind my current body, why should I risk so many things just to change it? I should be content or at least, be okay with what I was given. But the yearning wouldn't stop. Something is off and I need help. I can give you a more detailed list of why I might and might not be trans in the comment since I don't want to make the post too long. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy current plan is to... I don't know, wait it out. Maybe in five years or ten. Preferably after my parents have peacefully passed away so that they wouldn't have to live with the stigma. So that they wouldn't be hurt and confused by my own problems. At this point, I wish I could pull my brain out and get rid of these thoughts. Back to what I said at the post, I **really** hope this was just me going through a phase. Maybe it's my depression. Maybe it's my insecurities and a vain hope that I would look and feel better as a man. Maybe it's Trans OCD. Maybe I just need someone to point out that I'm just a girl looking for a reason to be \"special\". Maybe I'm a trender.

I've known I was trans since I was 12 and have been diagnosed with dysphoria since I was 14, with the diagnosis staying consistent over  mental health professionals over the years. \nMy old psychiatrist was the only one who didn't address me being trans. It was diagnosed by my old therapist, 4 separate psychiatric hospitals, my new therapist, the therapist at my university, and by both the psychiatrist and psychologist in the residential treatment center I went to. My old psychiatrist however never seemed to get that I was trans, and my last time seeing him he asked \"are you still a lesbian?\" (which like, no because 1) I'm a boy and 2) I'm bi but okay).\nAnyways, he up and vanished. Like I went in for an appointment one day and he just wasn't there. No one at that office has any idea where he is, what happened, like he is just fucking gone. \nSo, I naturally had to start seeing a new psychiatrist. Turns out, the old one not only ignored me being trans, but ignored some very serious symptoms in regards to my main medications that has potentially permanent consequences (we love nerve damage to my dopamine receptors causing fucking drug-induced parkinsonism and being ignored when I mention the symptoms). \nSo my new psychiatrist immediately saw in my records that I am trans. She immediately asked my pronouns, my preferred name (since my legal one is still very obviously a girl's name), and if I plan on transitioning. \nObviously I responded with he/him, my preferred name, and yes through legal means, surgery, and hormone therapy. \nIt is in my records that I've consistently had dysphoria for going on 6 years as explained above, and that well goes over the 18 months of diagnosed dysphoria needed for a mental health professional to sign off on transition.\nSo, should I ask her about starting T in my next session? I go back to her in 2 and a half more weeks, but that will only be my 2nd time seeing her. \n\nSecondly, I had to go to the OBGYN in order to get my birth control refilled (I've been on it for going on 8 years for regulation purposes, not contraceptive). They wanted to do my first ever pelvic exam since I'm almost 20, and I had a complete panic attack thanks to dysphoria and PTSD; luckily, she suddenly got called into the hospital to deliver a baby, and they rescheduled with me. I am also going back to her in 2 weeks for the exam. \nShould I ask her about starting T? \nI honestly don't like her much, as she has come across as very transphobic in the past (disregarding me when I say I'm trans, mentioning her other trans patients and how they aren't *really* guys, shit like that). \n\nShould I ask both my psychiatrist and OBGYN, or should I just ask one and not the other?

Is it hard to find a balance or do you just know what steps you want to take?\n\n**How did you figure out you're NB?** Was it a situation of \"Oh no, I am not \\[birth gender\\]. Oh no, I am not \\[other gender\\] either.\" Did you ever think you were the opposite gender you were assigned at birth or did you know you're NB as soon as you realized you're not your birth gender?\n\n**How do you explain to new people (friends, work, partners) that you are NB? Have you had bad reactions?** \n\n**In terms of sexuality,** (for lack of better phrasing) **what are you?** I know sexuality and gender are different things but gender influences the labels we use. For example a man who loves men is gay. A woman who loves women is a lesbian. Liking both is bi or pan. If you are neither male nor female, how do you navigate it? What does your partner identify as? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n***Thanks. I'm trying to learn about NBs but don't know anyone who I could ask.

I don\u2019t want to flood this post with all I\u2019ve tried and what I got from it, but I\u2019ve tried to go deep and take time to try things and reflect; I\u2019m almost 30 and have always felt like a stranger to myself until I started to do this self reflection.  While I went from not believing I could be trans in the start to starting to believe that I could be now.  I have a sibling(afab) that claimed to be trans a few years ago that will dress super girly and flant their figure at the drop of a hat and doesn\u2019t care if someone uses female pronouns for them, and it has the family confused or even not believing their claim (me included).  Because of the way my sibling has handled \u2019being trans\u2019 I don\u2019t feel like I can talk to family and have a clean slate to continue trying out things; I have a strong want to move off to search for people I can approach for a fresh start.\n\nToday I was in a terrible mood, having to socialize with said sibling and their partner(afab) which claims to be genderfluid and has an obsession with prom dresses which they will drop all their discomfort at being seen as a female the instant they see a prom dress they want to try on; all I want is to stay home alone with my partner who has been the only one I\u2019ve told about this and is kind enough to try male pronouns for me when alone.  While out I had a passing moment of being award of and uncomfortable with my chest, but to be honest I\u2019m not that good at sorting out and recognizing my feelings to figure out what\u2019s going on.

I argued that it is necessary. The other person argued that dysphoria isn\u2019t necessary BUT gender incongruence is.\n\nI started off by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s research that explains transgenderism and dysphoria. Basically, when fetuses are developing in the womb, their brains are exposed to certain hormones that give them a neurological sex, or a brain sex. For most people (cis people), the brain sex corresponds to the physical sex. For trans people, the brain sex differs from the physical sex. This causes trans people to feel disconnected from the sex characteristics of their bodies to the point of it causing distress. THAT is what dysphoria is. It doesn\u2019t make sense for someone who is non-dysphoric to be trans because that would mean that their physical sex corresponds to their brain sex. And if that is the case, what reason would someone have for being trans other than personal choice?\u201d\n\nThey replied, \u201cBut you can have the disconnect without the stress. That\u2019s what gender incongruence is. Dysphoria is distress over the disconnect, but gender incongruence is just the disconnect itself. Someone can feel disconnected from their body without it being distressing. That\u2019s all it takes to be trans.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense to me. How would you know that there\u2019s a disconnect in the first place without feeling any distress, even if it\u2019s in the form of discomfort, unfamiliarity, confusion, etc. What would tell you, \u201cHey, something here isn\u2019t quite right,\u201d if not distress? I feel that distress is heavily implied when it comes to your neurology being disconnected from your body.\n\nWhen I researched gender incongruence, it seemed to be pretty much the same thing as gender dysphoria. So my question is: what is the difference, if there\u2019s a difference at all, between gender dysphoria and gender incongruence? And how is it possible to feel a disconnect without any distress whatsoever?

There are many common beliefs within this, from binarism to disqualification of euphoria, but ultimately transmedicalism is not contingent upon any. When we apply this definition to the community as a whole, this can almost obviously be reworded as the problem such that the group of self-identified dysphoric people (*dysphorics*) is smaller than that of self-identified transgender people (for convenience, let those that consider themselves transgender but not dysphoric be called *nondysphorics*). I call this a problem because, for a transmedicalist, this fact contradicts the definition of transgender itself. So how do we react to this dissonance?\n\nI find there are two types of transmedicalists: in response to the dysphoric problem, there are the those that try to expand the set of dysphoric people by claiming that nondysphorics in fact do have dysphoria, and those that try to shrink the set of transgender people by saying that nondysphorics actually are not transgender. The former concept I call *soft* transmedicalism, and the latter concept I call *hard* transmedicalism. In other words, when working from the axiom that *dysphoric* and *transgender* are equivalent terms, and there are two differing groups, each considering themselves to be a different respective term, the hard transmedicalist will call the former group the true one, and the soft transmedicalist likewise.\n\nI feel that this distinction is absolutely vital, because despite sharing a common belief on dysphoria, the two groups otherwise are almost entirely different in their treatment of and feelings towards the issue. I have found, for example, that hard transmedicalists are more likely to focus on the problem of 'transtrenders' and the appropriation of transgender people, while soft transmedicalists are more likely to focus on how we define dysphoria and treat the term and its relationship with euphoria. In fact, euphoria seems to be a somewhat critical distinction between hard and soft transmedicalism: the latter will often consider euphoria merely a subset or form of dysphoria, while the former is likely to disagree and consider it to be separate entirely.\n\nOne may respond to this by claiming that neither group is accurate, with each taking an unnecessary extreme: perhaps the true set is greater than the dysphoric set but smaller than the self-identified transgender set, or in other words perhaps the problem that more people are dysphoric than those that claim to be so and the problem that many people falsely claim to be transgender are both valid and coexistent problems?\\* The answer, I believe, is that this concern is very much a valid one, but not one that warrants abandoning of soft transmedicalism. After all, soft transmedicalism at its core is not mutually exclusive with the existence of transgender 'false positives', malicious or otherwise\u2014it merely brings focus upon the expansion of the dysphoric set as opposed to the shrinking of its counterpart.\n\nSo why is this important? What does the distinction mean for us? I would like to clarify that I am not here valuing either hard or soft transmedicalism over the other, in validity or values, and I shall not criticise either for its counterpart. Perhaps the most immediately clear argument for the distinction is the response of the antitransmedicalist, who is more likely to object personally to the hard transmedicalist than the soft one. After all, considering the oft-presented argument of invalidation, it is perhaps clear that such an argument would only apply to the hard transmedicalist. However, the arguments of soft transmedicalists are often unheard due to conflation by others with their hard counterparts. This distinction is also a valuable one due to the number of discussions between the two groups that falter due to false assumptions of each others' beliefs. With a knowledge of each others' base ideas, perhaps these difficulties may be averted.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n^(*This claim, I must point out, is unlikely to be made by hard transmedicalists due to the nature of their belief on dysphoria.)", "date": "2019-06-02 18:14:20", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bw0cy8/hard_and_soft_transmedicalisma_distinction/", "author": "HysteriacTheSecond"}, {"title": "I was banned from r/suddenlytrans for this comment.", "text": "", "date": "2019-06-02 18:46:29", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bw0q3k/i_was_banned_from_rsuddenlytrans_for_this_comment/", "author": "ShinyMet"}, {"title": "idk what to put here", "text": "just had a tucute tell me that i should die for being truscum, who then proceeded to accuse me of being a supremacist and transphobe lololol\n\nedit: hes now claiming that truscum aren\u2019t lgbt what", "date": "2019-06-02 20:23:34", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bw1t5z/idk_what_to_put_here/", "author": "sknnylgnds"}, {"title": "Thought ya'll would appreciate this", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-06-02 21:30:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bw2jx5/thought_yall_would_appreciate_this/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "What does transmed actually mean?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-06-02 23:30:09", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bw3sy6/what_does_transmed_actually_mean/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Wanted to ask this somewhere where I\u2019d get some reasonable answers", "text": "I know if I posted this thread on almost any other trans sub I\u2019d be bombarded with comments like, \u201cOf course you\u2019re valid!\u201d or \u201cHow could you say you need dysphoria to be trans, truscum.\u201d But I need some actual advice heh \n\nIs it possible to be trans without dysphoria in certain areas?

The push to ask someone what their preferred pronouns are.  At first I didn't mind because online, you don't always know right away.  So okay.  Whatever.\n\nThen I saw people on Tumblr say this is something we should be doing offline.  I didn't like this notion, but I mean.  It's Tumblr.\n\nWell.  A couple of years ago I went to an LGBT awards dinner on behalf of my work.  The night started off with two people talking about pronouns and their importance in the community.  He/him, she/her, they/them, and even ones like ey/em and xey/xem.  They expressed that we need to get into the habit of asking people their pronouns and just how easy it is.  Then they asked us to turn to the people next to us and ask what their pronouns are so that we get comfortable with the idea.\n\n...I'm not easily offended, but this was really upsetting and really uncomfortable to me.  \n\nThat was the only time I encountered offline.  Until this year.\n\nI've joined a group.  It's not an LGBT group, but there are a lot of LGBT people in it and allies.  They are very welcoming and we have a lot of fun.  The problem is...they really push the idea of asking people their pronouns.  There are people who just wear pins or \"pronoun tags\" so you just notice it, but every gathering I go to I will be asked what my pronouns are at least three different times.  Sometimes more.\n\nAnd it makes me so fucking uncomfortable every time.\n\nHonestly it is more uncomfortable than when someone assumes and is wrong.  I don't mind correcting people if they are wrong.  I get it.  There are certain things about me that shows what my birth sex is.

Things have changed now, I dont know when or how, and I don't do any of these things anymore.

What if I'm looking for \"uwu validation\" because deep down I'm not trans?\n\n- the thought of transitioning is scary. I really like the idea of getting hormones, growing a beard and other secondary male characteristics and stuff, but to a degree I can't help but feel a little... scared about how things will be. And what if HRT makes me even more unattractive? :') Ok but seriously, the idea of living such a difficult, different life, even if it's the one I want, really kinda scares me. Also the thing that scares me the most is not being taken seriously as a man because of my height (I'm 5'4\"...). Haha. I know there's cis men who are even shorter than me. But they're also still generally mocked for it. It's scary to think about the consequences, and the discrimination and other people's reaction and generally not really being able to get to live like every other cis man. Not to the fullest at least. \n\n- sometimes I get an overwhelming urge to come out to all my friends. what if, again, I'm just seeking validation?\n\n- sometimes I think about all the \"\"\"privileges\"\"\" that come with being a girl (never being the target of a physical fight, lower ticket prices for discotheques and stuff like that) and I think I will kinda miss them.

Not sure if I have it or not", "text": "Ok, so I\u2019m an AFAB 32 year old person who identifies as non-binary (I guess \u201cagender\u201d would be more specific). I don\u2019t refer to myself as transgender because no actual transitioning has or ever will take place. \n\nAs far at my mentality goes, I feel like I just hate gender and it\u2019s something I want no part of. I hate being seen as a woman, but I\u2019m realistic that anyone interacting with me irl or someone who\u2019s seen a lot of pictures of me will see me as a woman. I don\u2019t fault them for that. I dressed very gender neutral for most of my life (I think I spent about 20 years in blue jeans lol). A while back I thought it would be fun, and more flattering for my body type, to change up my style and so I decided to present as what I call \u201chyper-femme\u201d - which boils down to dresses and pearls every single day, no exceptions. In my mind the way I choose to express myself is kind of tongue-in-cheek, a little joke I have with myself.\n\nNow, since I have no problem with presenting as my assigned gender, I\u2019m not open about the non-binary thing with people I know. They would just laugh at me or call me weird or, in the worst case scenario, stop being friends with me (a lot of my friends, both trans and cis, have a deep burning hatred of what they call the \u201cthey/thems\u201d). I don\u2019t want to explain to most of them the symptoms I feel that might be dysphoric, mostly because I\u2019m embarrassed.\n\nOk, so, here goes nothing: [NSFW] I feel really really weird about not having a dick. At times it almost feels like I have a phantom limb. It\u2019s also tied into my sexuality. I never realized why I didn\u2019t enjoy sex with women as much as I enjoy sex with men, despite being more attracted to women. I realized that it\u2019s because, whenever I imagine myself in a sexual encounter with a woman, I picture myself as having a penis. I have dreams about it, even. The thought of using a strap-on always just seemed like a pale imitation that might make me feel even worse, like emotionally painful. And it\u2019s not like I hate having vaginal sex with someone with a penis, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m preoccupied with the thought of having a penis. I don\u2019t feel like FtM bottom surgery is an option I want to pursue, for the same reason I\u2019ve never used a strap-on and because the surgery seems primitive in comparison to MtF SRS. \n\nAnother thing is my voice. I have a fairly deep voice for an AFAB but I\u2019m disappointed that it\u2019s not deeper, like unnatural deep. I enjoy singing and I tend to listen to male singers because I can match their voice range better when I\u2019m singing along. But sometimes they\u2019ll hit a low note that I can\u2019t hit, and I\u2019ll feel so frustrated and weirdly disappointed with myself. One of my favorite compliments is when someone says \u201cYou have a deep voice for a woman!\u201d I want to be a tenor, or even a baritone, but those are voice roles reserved for men. I want to have the kind of voice that an AFAB person can\u2019t physically have, like a gender-swapped version of the castrati of old.\n\nAnother thing is that I\u2019ve kind of let the Internet swallow up my life because I get to present how I want online. I\u2019m a heavy twitter user, and I like to alternate using profile pictures of both men and women, and to give myself a masculine display name, to keep people confused about my gender. I don\u2019t want someone to look at my posts and think \u201cThat\u2019s a woman\u201d or \u201cThat\u2019s a guy\u201d. I don\u2019t put my pronouns in my bio for several reasons, one of them being that I choose to let my posts speak for themselves, another being that I know a lot of people who would mock me. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m sorry for this long rambling, I just wanted to know if the dick stuff, the voice stuff, and the psychological stuff counted as dysphoria, or if I\u2019m just some weirdo who needs help.

I'm excited for it. I'm so ready to transition and finally feel at peace in my body.\n\nBut I can't help but wonder if it's unnecessary. \n\nPart of me still thinks that maybe, just maybe, I could live as a woman. It would be easier. I wouldn't have to come out to anyone, I wouldn't have to spend tons of money, I wouldn't have to inject myself with hormones. I wouldn't have to worry about future relationships. It would be so much simpler.\n\nBut I probably wouldn't live to see 25.\n\nBut maybe I would. Maybe I could just be a woman for the rest of my life. Maybe I could get help for my depression in another way. \n\nOr maybe I'm not trans at all. Maybe I just have body dysmorphia. Maybe I just need a better therapist.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYeah. I guess I'm just scared. This is all a lot. I really wish I were cis. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm excited to get on T but can't help thinking that maybe I'm faking it. Maybe I just want attention. \n\nThat's not true at all. I hate being trans. I hate talking about it. Telling my mom was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I haven't told my sister yet because I hate talking about being trans. My mom keeps asking me what my plans are and idk how to talk to her about T and surgeries. \n\nTalking about being trans makes me feel so anxious. It feels like my biggest insecurities are laid out for everyone to see. It feels *wrong.* I know there's nothing wrong with being trans. It's been scientifically proven. It's real. It's how I was born. But I still feel *guilty.* I feel bad that I'm too depressed to get a job and have been living off my mother for the past year. I feel bad that I'm turning everything upside down and asking people to change the way they see me. I feel bad that while everyone else my age is halfway through university and making friends and plans for the future, I can't even leave my bedroom. \n\nI've dealt with an eating disorder in the past. As a child I comfort-ate and as a teen I hated what all that food had done to my body and became bulimic. I still comfort-eat. I know I need to get over it but my only other coping mechanism is music which makes my dysphoria worse. The thing that's meant to heal me is making me sick. \n\nI'm trying to control my eating habits so I don't fall back into bulimia but it's hard. I just want to feel good. Food has comforted me in the past and bulimia made me feel even better. It was like a high. Knowing I had that much control. Knowing that I could do whatever I wanted with no consequences. I say no consequences because even though I know it's dangerous, nothing bad has ever happened. I know I was lucky in that. Some people die from bulimia. I think the fact that nothing bad happened made it even better for me. It was like I was gambling with my life and I won every time. Every time I went too far and thought I was going to pass out and not wake up, *I woke up.* I would go to school and be dizzy all day. It was like a high for me. Nothing in the world hurt me because it was all so hazy. No one ever found out about my bulimia which made me feel even more powerful.\n\nI just want to feel that again. \n\nI miss being bulimic. As sick as that sounds, I want to feel how I felt. I want to eat whatever I want without fear of gaining weight. I want that control.\n\nBut I can't.\n\nMy T doctor is also an ED specialist so if I show up with bruised knuckles and a swollen face, she'll know. I won't be allowed on T.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs scary as going on T is, not going on it scares me more.\n\nI know that if I don't transition, I won't live the life I'm meant to. I would probably become bulimic again. I wouldn't be careful this time and it would kill me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust had to get this out. Sorry for the vent.

I've seen photos of 'futa' srs where there is penis, but also neovaginal cavity created. It doesn't make much sense for me. But there is an alternative that I've never seen. What if the penis was reshaped into a vulva with a larger neoclitoris, but without the cavity? Wouldn't it lower dysphoria without creating a place that can bring pain due to risk of necrosis and stretching? Side note, I know they significantly lower penis tissue because vulvas are lower and I wonder whether the risk of this, especially if neovaginal canal is not being made, would be significantly lowered if it was made as the site the penis originally is. Without lowering you can create neoclit on the site of the penis by removing the length and using the whole tip (to avoid too much reshaping to try to maintain as much sensation), use skin from testicles to create neo labias minoras and then skin from around the create neo labias majoras. To me it makes most sense and seems to carry least risk.\n\n// I currently do not study to be a surgeon and don't have such plans as of now, but no one knows what the future holds.

But based on some casual conversations had with a few of them, I started to feel like they\u2019re really just tucutes... most of them are probably mistaking internalized misogyny or body dysmorphia for gender dysphoria. Or maybe are just GNC, liking sweatpants over skinny jeans, or simply mad at the patriarchy that\u2019s all - it doesn\u2019t make you trans.\n\nSome of them would bind or want top or breast reduction surgery while presenting quite feminine.

They are not using xe/xir pronouns, or calling themselves demiautismgender. I might be speaking for others and offending people, but just because you use \u201cthey/them\u201d and the non-binary label, doesn\u2019t make your identity valid?\n\nIdk... and I wouldn\u2019t care if they weren\u2019t making my life harder.

Not just from the transphobes, either.", "text": "https://i.redd.it/u5h105qxci331.png\n\nOkay, yes. Body positivity is great. With dysmorphia (which usually doesn't abate with surgical treatment), I can see its validity as a coping mechanism. But both the tucutes and the transphobes completely miss the picture on what *dysphoria* is. It's not dysmorphia (a misdiagnosis is probably the reason for a lot of detransitioners), as the [educated] transphobes say, but it certainly is not a social construct, as the tucutes say.\n\nIt just makes me so mad... especially from the mainstream outlets. The typical \"but cis people have [*insert anthropometric statistic here*] too!\" is really annoying, but I'm finding myself shocked at how many people say just completely crazy things like \"attempting to pass is internalized transphobia,\" and honestly? They're not getting the push-back they should be... as usual.\n\nIt's just irritating. I'll post somewhere that I'm feeling very suicidal over my broad bone structure -- like 70% of the people tell me \"oh, we know SO many broad shouldered women whose shoulders are broader than one standard deviation of men\" (I've checked -- my shoulders would be literally in like the 99.999th percentile for women) and the other 30% give me that \"internalized transphobia\" rhetoric, as if my gender dysphoria offends them on some innate level... just like it does to transphobes. I hate what testosterone did to my body... my shoulders, my chin... I'm just growing so weary of looking in the mirror and seeing a boy with long hair.\n\nBut noooo, trying to \"cis-pass\" is internalized transphobia, because in the ideal anarcho-communist utopia, I would be sporting a 12-inch beard, big bushy eyebrows, a flat chest, no curves whatsoever, and having the time of my life in a mini-dress and stilettos, having sex with all the straight guys who see me as a woman for some reason even though I've done absolutely nothing to my presentation. (overly sexual focus of this paragraph is intentional. Lol.) I only want to pass because of all the transphobia in society! I would love facial hair, if only it weren't for those darned transphobes! Oh, and don't get me wrong -- I would die for that amazing receding forehead that men have, if only Germaine Greer and her band of merry women ceased to exist!\n\nIn other words, I want a male body, but my dysphoria over my male features is just because of internalized transphobia. Sounds about right.\n\nAnd then I hear transphobes talking about how we [trans people] \"pump our bodies full with hormones\" when we just need to be ourselves\u2122; I quote, \". . .if you identify strongly with the opposite sex that doesn\u2019t mean you have to change yourself to fit that. You can just be who you are.\" (yes, gaze upon the first fruits of the \"I identify as. . .\" movement, with the ignorance of dysphoric pain that naturally follows)\n\nEerily similar. The tucutes provide the tenet, and the transphobes provide the conclusion.\n\nFuck the mindless so-called \"body positivity\" in trans spaces. It's harmful. Encouraging people to self-loathe is certainly a bad thing, but so is being dismissive of or outright hostile to their pain. \"Body positivity\" is a curse, and it's alarming how similar tucute and transphobic rhetoric sounds.", "date": "2019-06-10 11:22:33", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/bywni5/vent_why_do_i_hear_this_rhetoric_a_lot_not_just/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Honestly can\u2019t stop thinking phallo is so \u201cbad\u201d for a reason", "text": "Tw: genital mention\n\nCis people hate all afabs and honestly always think we\u2019re inferior because for whatever reason, \u201cvaginas\u201d are inferior to dicks. \n\nI could definitely imagine them not even trying to make phalloplasty better consciously because they don\u2019t want \u201cfemales\u201d to ever actually be \u201cequal\u201d to males esp in regards to dicks. \n\nMost cis males would be really angry and offended if trans men could have functioning and perfect aesthetic dicks since with ALT we could get longer than average ones.

If sex =/= gender, and presentation =/= gender, what exactly does gender mean? \n\nI'm not disputing the idea of feminine men, masculine women, or NBs who present either way - I'm just lost on what exactly defines someone as Male, Female, NB? \n\nThe big confusion is regarding my personal situation (for clarification's sake, I'm an adult AFAB who has never really had an issue with being seen as a woman). I don't have any issues with she/her pronouns, I like my curves, I like my breasts, I like to dress up femininely. I definitely have very GNC days where I dress/do myself up masculinely, and sometimes then I do get annoyed with my breasts because I can't be very guy-like with them (or on days when I want to be feminine but featureless), but it's not a constant in my life.\n\nSo I'm pretty much cool with my presentation and secondary sex characteristics. It's the primary that really gets me. \n\nI really don't like to think about the fact that I have female reproductive organs. \n\nBefore going through puberty, I literally prayed that I would be infertile and never get my period. I quickly had to come to terms with that, but I still can't stand the idea that I have ovaries and a womb and vagina. The idea of becoming pregnant disgusts me, and while I don't want children (especially since I would have to bear them) I would be fine fathering a child if it meant a lot to my partner. I should have male reproductive organs, not female ones. \n\nI identify as an asexual because my sex organs are so wrong that I just can't muster the interest to have sex as a female, which makes me feel like a fake. I love the asexual community and wholeheartedly support my fellow aces, but I know that if I had a penis I probably wouldn't be ace. \n\nSo I'm just confused about what's going on, and I trust this community to be bluntly honest about what it means. Am I just your standard sometimes GNC cis gal?

I'd been out irl for years, but I came out online when I was almost 16 I think? We had a trans woman come out a few months after me, and a trans guy a year or so later, but it was just the three of us for the longest time.\n\nWhen I was around 18, it seemed like everyone started coming out as trans. A fairly close-knit community of say, 50 people, and suddenly as opposed to the 3 trans people there originally were, there were probably 10, and every month or two after that, someone new would come out. A lot of them when explaining their dysphoria just described body dysmorphia. A lot of them started identifying as nonbinary simply due to being gnc. \n\nI'm not on there anymore because everyone was toxic as hell and abusive, trans issues aside, but of those original 50 people, I don't think it would have been an exaggeration to say all but about 10 of them were trans and/or nonbinary when I left. I'm still very good friends with three cis guys from there actually, and apparently a couple more people have came out since I've been gone as of a few months ago.\n\nBesides me, the trans woman, and the trans man, were any of them legitimately dysphoric trans people? Maybe. Who knows. If so, more power to them, that's great. Did several of them misunderstand dysphoria or claim to be trans due to being gender nonconforming? Yep. \n\nI understand that it's common for people to seek out others with shared experiences or people they have something in common with, but even had some people not flat out admitted to being nondysphoric, I find it incredibly difficult to believe a pretty good sized group of people would suddenly all be trans, when they weren't out originally. Hell, some people were there just because they didn't have anyone else. Some loved anime. Most of us just started talking because of similar views on things and a love of video games. We didn't seek each other out due to being lgbt, but suddenly everyone came out as lgbt. I dunno. I don't buy that. Does it make me an asshole? Maybe. Is it hard to believe anyway? Absolutely.\n\nAlmost everyone there was mentally ill (Nothing wrong with that. I am too. There's too much stigma around mental illness anyway). A lot of them had horrible home lives.

My goal was, above all, to improve my overall quality of life. My reason for detransition is the same. But before I go further into that, I should go a bit into my history.\n\nI first told my mom I was a girl when I was 9. All through puberty, the changes fucking killed me. When I was 17 I got a prescription for hormones, followed by my parents kicking me out. I was homeless, and I never picked the prescription up. It took years to try again. I started hormones when I was 22. Far too late. I tried to kill myself many times during that 5 year period. It was not an easy time, testosterone gives me major anger issues. I am narrow shouldered, I have wide hips... My body would be ok, if not for the fact I am TALL. 6'2\" in fact. I feel like I could pass if not for my height. My face isn't perfect, but it's good enough. The issue is that my height draws so much attention. I can't go anywhere without people staring at me.\n\nWhich brings me to why I think I intend to detransition:\n\nI miss being able to just.... Go out in public, without having to worry about getting hurt, without having to feel judgement in the eyes of a hundred strangers. I just want to be invisible. Add to that the fact hrt has done very little for me, and I'm just feeling like, well, I'm glad I tried to transition, because now I can check that little box off in my head. I know I'm a woman. I know I am trans. I don't have to wonder anymore. But now it feels like it's time to take that part of me, pick it up, and put it away.\n\nI just want to be able to go to the grocery store without anxiety, I want to be able to get a job. Plus I wasn't a bad looking man, in fact I'd argue that with a bit of work I could actually be extremely attractive as a \"man\". I will still have to deal with dysphoria, but at least I know it is dysphoria. And I just feel like that's way less.... Difficult? Than trying to transition. I wish I could. You ladies who can and have transitioned are incredible to me and I will protect you until my dying fucking breath, but I can't join you.\n\nThe biggest things I'm going to hate are the return of my libido and the return of my anger. In a way my libido has already been coming back, but on hrt it's different. I'm not looking forward to it reverting. I'm also not looking forward to dealing with my anger/rage again, and I'm not sure how I'm going to handle that. I will, I'm just not looking forward to it.\n\nI feel like transitioning was the right choice for me, but moving on is also the right choice. Am I on to something or am I just an idiot who's about to throw away years of progress? If I can eventually pass, I will keep going, I just don't see that being possible. I'm just sick of feeling so isolated. I feel even more isolated because all my irl trans friends pass, they don't get it and they just keep telling me to keep at it. They all have genetics and/or money that I do not, and they just don't understand. They are going to hate me for this. Which makes me so sad because I love them. I just can't keep going anymore. I don't have it in me.\n\nI feel like I have so much more to say, but the words aren't coming to me. And I don't care. I think I'm going to move somewhere in the woods, far from everyone, where I can just be alone. Honestly the idea of living in a cabin somewhere in Alaska sounds pretty awesome.

I never had any doubts even once. My best friend insisted I was a trans man, and honestly? That still didn't make me doubt anything, though I did test out the idea briefly and confirmed that it wasn't the case\n\nI had long hair for years, and I'm actually growing it out again, but a couple years ago I cut it short for the first time in my life, and I decided to start experimenting more with fashion since I finally had a bit of money and I'd been wearing the same 2 pairs of jeans, 4 walmart shirts, and a hoodie for years. I tried men's clothes, and immediately had the demiboy label slapped on me by others. I wasn't really convinced demigenders were a thing, but 5 years in a transidentitarian echo chamber can tend to fuck with you, and I figured \"well maybe they're right. I mean, I know I present kind of masculine\" even though I know gender expression doesn't have a damn thing to do with what your actual gender is. I think it had a lot to do with me being severely depressed, and I was willing to take suggestions about anything from anyone just to try to sort my life out.\n\nSo I called myself a demiboy for awhile. I was honestly pretty uncomfortable with it, and felt dysphoric calling myself a \"boy\" or a \"man\" in any way, just like I felt if I was referred to as a \"girl\" or a \"woman\", but I figured maybe it would get better with time. I seemed to gain some kind of popularity from it too, and I honestly wasn't thrilled about it. I liked to keep to myself. When I talked about wanting to pass (as agender specifically. The closest thing to passing unfortunately for me is androgyny.) I was always told that I shouldn't worry about passing, and that trans people can look any way and still be valid, as if that was going to get rid of my dysphoria. When I talked about bottom surgery, thanks to the \"demiboy\" label I was sort of pressured into, everyone assumed I wanted traditional ftm meta or phallo done, and would try to help me find surgeons no matter how much i insisted \"no, I want some sort of \"nullo\" surgery done\", or they would tell me \"you don't need bottom surgery to be valid\" AS IF MY DESIRE FOR BOTTOM SURGERY IS ABOUT FEELING \"VALID\" AND NOT DUE TO 15+ YEARS OF DYSPHORIA.\n\nAnyway, I decided to try makeup for the first time in my life, and decided i honestly love doing it. It's not something I'd really go in public with due to it being deemed \"feminine\" and whatnot, but it's something I think is cool to experiment with in the comfort of my own home. I posted some selfies, and got asked if I was \"identifying as genderfluid now\" just because I had makeup on, and that's the point I realized \"what the hell all this leftbook shit (and by extension, tumblr, most of trans reddit, etc) is literally basing gender off of stereotypes this is bs\". So I immediately made it public that I was NOT a \"demiboy\", that I felt pressured into calling myself one due to gendered stereotypes and my own depression.\n\nI still consider myself agender (obviously), and I know some people still take issue with that, but it's what properly describes my dysphoria and how my body is supposed to be, and not a label I chose or had pushed on me due to gender nonconformity. I've never felt more secure in it than I do now. I just think things like this are important to note because TAPs claim \"truscum force us back in the closet\" and \"transmeds hate gnc people\" but refuse to see that sometimes THEY negatively influence emotionally vulnerable and troubled people to a point that they claim to be something that makes them feel like shit as opposed to what they know they actually are. I'm not saying I wasn't at fault, because I was, but it wasn't all on me. I've never had a transmed try to push me into choosing another label, or deciding I'm some other gender due to stereotypes, and any other transmed that's been convinced I'm a trans man or a cis girl despite my angenital (I believe that's the right word) dysphoria, or my dysphoria about being either sex or appearing as either sex? We've been able to agree to disagree and leave each other alone instead of shoving each other into categories we don't belong in.\n\nEdit: Just as a side note, I totally support experimenting with different labels while you try to figure out your gender and/or sexuality but there's a difference between exploring things at your own pace, and feeling pressured into something that makes you feel like shit and then feeling like you'll be attacked if you \"opt out\" of that", "date": "2019-06-14 02:09:11", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/c0ejgz/tucutes_are_the_only_ones_to_make_me_question_my/", "author": "neonaggregator"}, {"title": "Help with terminology", "text": "Hello!

I guess my brain decided to connect trans people (especially tucutes) with what happened to me. It sucks, because the trans community is a community that I'm a part of too, and I don't want my trauma associated with one person to influence my life to that degree, plus I don't want it to influence how I see people who haven't done a damn thing wrong.

I have very extreme body dysphoria, especially about my chest and lower area. It has completely crippled my spirit and self esteem to the point where the only time I leave the house is to either go to school or walk my dog. I have 0 friends, the last time someone invited me to hang out was probably when I was 11.  My mum feels very guilty that she never took me seriously all the times I said I wanted to be a male and is willing to let me take testosterone and have surgeries. The problem is my dad is a religious nut job and would rather me drop dead than become a man. At home I am restricted to what clothes I am allowed to wear and am banned from cutting my hair. The strange thing is that I actually pass very well as a male, when I was younger I got bullied for the amount of hair I had on my legs/arms and my deep voice (deeper than my dad\u2019s somehow). I go to a Catholic high school so they\u2019re not the most accepting people there.

It appears even getting a hand transplant from the actroid wouldn\u2019t be able to help.\n\nAu contraire, Nickie, I've seen so many people like you that I cannot find it in me to complain about Caitlyn Jenner and It's Ma'am having male skeletons.  It makes no sense to complain about *trans people who try to look the part* when people like *you* and Chris-chan and Jasper Gregory not only exist but appear to be a majority.\n\n&gt;The problem is that the default human morphology is female, and takes on male-typical secondary sex characteristics only through androgenization, which is progressive throughout life, and irreversible. Therefore, male characteristics on trans women stand out much more than female characteristics (apart from breasts) on trans men. \n\nWide hip bones are a pretty permanent trait unless you're one of the lucky few trans men who got HRT at an early age.  Late transitioning trans men like Wenn Lawson will *never* have passing male-looking hips, and unlike Nikita Dragun having narrow male hips it's not a problem that can be solved by hip injections. \n But leave it to our genius Doctor Tucute here to explain how hormones work.\n\n&gt;What\u2019s a Crossdresser to Do?\n\n&gt;The answer\u2019s simple: fuck passing! If everyone is going to know you\u2019re trans anyway, why not accept it and be aesthetically appealing while you\u2019re at it?\n\nhttps://pasunhomme.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/untransy1.png\n\nYou heard it first from Doctor Tucute, kids!  Bearded transtrenders  are more *aesthetically appealing* than a pretty girl with a penis.   Furthermore, people are *less* at ease from drag queens than from Jasper Gregory saying \"I am an authentic woman.\"  \n\n&gt;Early transitioners very closely approximate \"real\" women.  \n\n1. Laverne Cox is a towering 5 foot 11, noticeably taller than most women.  How is that different from Kellie Malone having large hands?\n\n2. According to your chart, men who are drag performers are at the *bottom* of the Uncanny Valley.  Where do early transitioners like Kelly Lauren who *were* drag queens as an outlet for dysphoria fit into your model?\n\n&gt;And, as demonstrated in nir book *Redefining Realness*, Janet Mock is at least one-hundred and ten percent woman.  \n\n&gt;Nearly all crossdressers and late transitioners fall into the bottom of the uncanny valley, \n\n\\&gt;placing crossdressing fetishists and trans women on the same axis\n\nHow Blanchardian.  Is this because you and Anne Lawrence want legitimacy for the obvious fetishes you have even at the cost of making other people look bad?\n\n&gt;unless perhaps they get facial feminization surgery (FFS).\n\nI'm pretty sure people are less bothered by Kellie Maloney having big hands in the women's restroom than by [Doctor Tucute](https://pasunhomme.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/20141222_142241.jpg) and his \"feminine beard\" marching into the women's restroom, but that's just my opinion.\n\n&gt;Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve done to find a look that works for me\n\n&gt;Embrace my beard.  Nothing appears as delusional as a crossdresser trying to appear female with five-o-clock shadow sticking out of a centimeter\u2019s thick layer of foundation.  Since I\u2019ve got dark hair, I\u2019ve either got to zap it or unwrap it.  Why get electrolysis?  I love my girly beard.  It exudes confidence.  It screams love me or get the fuck out of my way.  I don\u2019t even need the pepper spray in my purse.  I will thrash you.  Of course, there isn\u2019t a day when I don\u2019t look in the mirror and hold my hand up over my chin and picture myself without it.  \n\nYou have pale skin and dark hair.  Lasers are very effective at thinning out dark hair.\n\nYou know how I know this, Nickie?  Because I'm a cis guy who paid for that.  I'm lazy and bad at shaving my body and facial hair.  Now I only have to do it every few days.  Maybe you should have spent your money on *that* [instead of \"erotic couches.\"](https://pasunhomme.wordpress.com/2015/02/21/forcing-the-sun-to-rise/)  All you have to do is go on Groupon and look for the cheapest deal listed.  It would certainly be better than going through life wondering why the women you hook up with are \"pillow queens\" (hint: it's because they aren't attracted to your body.  It's exactly how men react to ugly gay men who are good at sucking their dick).\n\n&gt;But I never end up shaving it because I want to live life.  \n\nBy the way, the Foreign Legion requires everyone who isn't in the Engineers to shave their faces completely smooth.\n\n&gt;Instead I apply a sort of metrosexual technique and trim it down to 2mm every day and wax the cheek line every few weeks.  I don\u2019t want to relegate myself to brief trysts in dance clubs on dark nights before I turn into a pumpkin.\n\nDefinitely something a *real* trans woman like Leelah Alcorn would write and not something a metrosexual cis guy would write, gaiz.  \n\nIt's not like you *can't* wax the rest of the face.  Kay Brown's trans friends did that in the 70s.  *They* didn't have electrolysis money.\n\n&gt;It\u2019s been important to revive the little girl that\u2019s been suffocating since I was born.  I just save the cartoon characters for queer night at the roller rink since I don\u2019t want to look like a pedophile.\n\nGee, I wonder why /r/ItsAFetish complains about you and your autogynephilic sexual fantasies.  Sure is a complete mystery.\n\nThank you very much for your *genius* input, Doctor Tucute.  I'm sure trans women *love* the way you portray them.", "date": "2019-06-20 06:05:48", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/c2sc3t/crossdressing_and_the_untransy_valley_an/", "author": "ShitArchonXPR"}, {"title": "Is this normal?

Serious replies only, please.", "text": "While I agree that gender identity is based on brain structure, I can't claim to be an expert.  But if gender fluidity exists, there must be a reason for it, and I don't want to jump to the conclusion that anyone claiming this identity is just a \"special snowflake\" looking for attention.  If that's your belief and you prefer not to explore the possibilities of explaining how gender fluidity functions, I ask that you kindly refrain from saying so here.  I want to have a discussion about this and hopefully learn something before trying to form a solid opinion on the matter.  \n\nSo far, these are the answers I've seen given from various sources:\n\n1. Brain plasticity.  I don't know enough about this to agree or disagree with it.  I know our brains are constantly updating based on our experiences, but I don't know to what extent this affects gender identity.  So far, I haven't been able to find much info about it, so it's hard to form an opinion.\n2. Hormonal fluctuations.  Changes in your hormones could affect how much you \"feel\" like a certain gender at a given time.  Some people's hormones aren't as balanced as others; could this be strong enough to make them believe they are changing genders?\n3. Presentation.  There's also the possibility that \"gender fluid\" isn't actually a gender identity in and of itself, but a way of describing a nonbinary person whose presentation changes between masculine and feminine for whatever reason (mood, hormones, convenience?).  \n4. Dysphoria fluctuation.  Even if a person has dysphoria, they won't necessarily feel it in all its extremes all the time.  Whether this is due to external factors, something biological, or them simply being able to ignore it for extended periods, I'm not sure.  \n\nThe first two I'm really unsure of.  The second two I don't doubt are probably the case for at least some people.  \n\nI'd like to know what others think, what their experiences are, and if there are any studies or resources that can provide a better understanding of the medical side of all this, if there is one.

I don't get why my choice to delay things or take my time makes me less legitimate. \n\nAnd I especially don't get why other trans people brush my reasoning off like it's unimportant. Detransition happens all the time. People die from the complications of SRS. They lose their families, jobs, and lives as a result of transition. It's a serious thing that requires a medical diagnosis, not a quirky personality trait. \n\nI get that shit from people all the time.

I wore the same clothes everyday, jeans and a hoodie. I just sat in my classes quiet while everyone else was talking. I had few friends and was an extreme loner. And the few friends I did have were only my friends for superficial reasons, like we listened to the same bands and played the same video games.

Even after coming out, I was able to burst out of my bubble and actually feel like I exist. It's crazy how much just coming out helps. I came out during my senior year of high school. I was kicked out of my original high school near the end of my sophomore year, and started my junior year at a continuation school. I finished my junior year there (extremely miserable) and decided to finish school at a charter school.  It was at the charter school that I was out and on hrt. I felt so happy and was so confident.

Promote the idea that gender itself is some sort of social construct, rather than a biological phenomenon\n2. Start recruiting everyone who's half-interested, and advise them to begin taking hormones immediately -- if only just to try them out. Because hormones are exceptionally safe, with absolutely no permanent effects, HRT is a good thing to do, just to see if you like it.\n3. Watch with a total lack of emotion as the people you indoctrinated eventually detransition because the result of your dogmatism was their first (and lasting) experience of actual gender dysphoria.\n4. Deny having any part in the encounter, and pretend detransitioners don't exist.\n5. Profit!\n\nOkay, /uj.\n\nBecause this really makes me sad... the way mainstream trans people seem to treat detransitioners, that is. I figured this would go here, because transmeds seem to be of the few who are actually sympathetic to their plight.\n\nEven when I was a tucute, the way most trans people seemed to treat detransitioners -- almost as disposable foot soldiers for some revolutionary gender army -- was revolting to me. I didn't want to say anything, because, in accordance with step 4 of the above instruction manual, saying anything of the sort would be ban-on-sight for any mainstream trans sub. It's only more revolting now. Irresponsible figure heads say absolutely dangerous things like \"try HRT to see if you like it,\" the rest of the mainstreamers spread their opinion like it's liquid gold, and, as expected, the number of cis people claiming transsexuality skyrockets. But, of course, they're cis. What they're doing catches up to them, and for the first time, they actually develop verifiable dysphoria -- not dysmorphia, which is often misdiagnosed, and certainly not the utter lack of dysphoria they seem to always have had before. To deal with their newfound dysphoria, they de-transition. But they quickly find their experiences suppressed by unfeeling tucutes, and they become literal unpersons the moment they don't want to pretend they're trans anymore. The mainstream trans community denies ever having had anything to do with them.\n\nIt's just disgusting to me. People that are often indoctrinated into the gender ideology are usually in very vulnerable positions emotionally and mentally when it happens. Trans people take advantage of this in a horrid way. And when the detransitioners inevitably detransition, there's no support network, and many trans people are *openly toxic* to them when they try to reach out for help to the groups that were seemingly so supportive before.\n\nOh, and I forgot the best part: tucutes get *mad* when detrans subs turn into gender-critical circlejerks!

Can't imagine why you'd do that though if you're dysphoric. I'm pretty sure pre-everything straight trans men don't call themselves lesbians. Trans women who like women don't say they're straight as far as I know either. Plus we already have gynesexual and androsexual (or nblw and nblm) to describe attraction to women and men respectively. Not to mention probably 75% or more of \"nonbinary lesbians\" I've seen have just been slightly gender nonconforming girls who say they don't have dysphoria or \"don't like gender rolls\". I've seen amab and afab people both who call themselves nonbinary lesbians though, and the majority seem to have no desire to transition. I was actually decent friends with someone who later claimed to be a nonbinary lesbian, but she had a boyfriend while claiming to be a lesbian, so I feel like that isn't helping anyone's case.\n\n\nSomeone calling themselves nonbinary and gay? I'm 100% sure they exist, but I've never seen it. Pretty much every nonbinary person I've seen attracted to men has used androsexual/nblm or some similar term to express that they're attracted to men.

I came out to her in February and I started T almost a week ago. She doesn't know I've started T and idk how she'll react.\n\nWhen I came out she basically said \"Do whatever makes you happy but don't expect me to call you a new name\". She told me I'll always be her daughter and my birth name to her. She doesn't quite get that dysphoria is a real thing (illness, idk not the point). I told her I want to basically start my life over and live as a man. I want to be stealth. Her response was something along the lines of \"I don't get why you care what people think of you\". That's not what this is about. Being stealth isn't just because I think people will think bad things if they know I'm trans. It's about living a life as the person I am. If I were openly trans, people would think of me and treat me as a girl. I live in the south in a major city so it's better than rural Alabama but still not as open as other places.\n\nI just want to live as a man. Not a trans man. A man. If I'm not stealth, that won't happen for me. (Obviously my family and my future partner would know.)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nShe hasn't called me my name yet. She constantly calls me \"she\" and \"her\" and our cat's \"big sister\".\n\nHow do I explain to her that it hurts to hear that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere's what I was thinking of saying:\n\nYou know I'm trans right? That's caused by a condition called gender dysphoria. The only way to alleviate it is to transition. Dysphoria basically feels like something is always wrong and nothing I do will make that feeling go away. It can be really hard sometimes. When you call me \\[birth name\\] or she or a sister, it sets off my dysphoria. I know that words shouldn't bother me, I don't think they do. It's not the words themselves, it's that those words remind me of how uncomfortable and sad I am in my body. I'd really appreciate it if you would think about calling me your son and Ben. I know it's going to be a weird change for you, it's weird for me too. But every time I hear \\[birth name\\] and daughter, it reminds me of the thing I hate most about myself. If it's too weird to call me Ben, can you try to just call me \\[childhood nickname that is gender neutral\\]? \n\nThe best way I can describe it is like how we can't say anything about how \\[cousin with anorexia\\] looks. Even if we tell her she looks good, that could still set off something in her head to make her stop eating. It's a similar feeling. Even if you are saying something positive like \"you're a good daughter\" it sets off alarms in my head. \n\nI started something called hormone replacement therapy. It's basically an artificially created male puberty. It's going to help align my body with my mind. It will make my voice drop, I'll get more muscular, and I might be able to grow facial hair. I won't grow a beard though because that would be itchy and I wouldn't like it but I'd like to have the choice to.\n\nIt takes a few months to see changes but this is what I need to do. I talked with a therapist and a doctor and this is the only way to help me. I won't be happy if I continue living as and looking female. I'm really tired of being sad and dealing with my dysphoria. Medically transitioning is the only proven way to alleviate my dysphoria so I can live a normal life.\n\nI'd really like it if you started trying to call me \"he\" and \"Ben\". I don't want you to tell your friends and co-workers. I can stay \"your daughter\" to them so you don't have to explain it to them. But when I'm around, I'd really like you to start calling me your son. Especially out in public. I'm trying my best to look male and when you call me your daughter, it outs me. Once I start seeing physical changes, it might be dangerous for you to refer to me as a girl. People aren't very accepting of trans people which is why I'm choosing to live stealth. Stealth is when you live your life as the gender you transition to without telling people you're trans. The only people that know are family and doctors. I think it's much safer to do this and will make me happier. \\[I'm probably going to talk about my career and how it'll be better to be stealth since my dream job is so hard to get anyway. being openly trans would make it even harder\\].\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts? I'm going on a trip with her this weekend (6 hour car ride) so I think I'm going to bring it up then. It'll give us time to talk.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyone have any advice for starting this conversation? I hate how much it bothers me but I'm sick of being her daughter. It really sets off my dysphoria when she talks \"in the cat's voice\" and calls me \"sissy\".

I live in the North West, the only part of England with no gender services at all, NHS or private, which means that I should be eligible for that.

For the record, I'm mostly talking about trans women in women's sport, although Mack Beggs in Texas showed pretty well what happens on the opposite side of the gender divide, and trans men in competitive athletics are a controversial topic, too because of how their HRT is seen by some as \"doping,\" which is absolute nonsense to be honest. I just wanted to ask thoughts here, without the scientific discussion of the subject being beaten down by a dozen ban-hammers.\n\nI kinda want to preface my own thoughts by bringing up the example of Caster Semenya, a cis (and intersex?) woman who possesses naturally high testosterone levels. What women's competition means needs to be evaluated, because men are not placed under the same scrutiny for possessing naturally high levels of the athletic wonder-drug testosterone. What is considered a gift, and what is considered an unfair advantage? The line between the two is very vague, and it shows itself on both sides of the debate IMO. With trans men, the debate comes up again. What's the difference between a man with a natural level of ~600, and a man with an artificial level of ~600? The line is so thin, but people seem to be readily willing to give cis men a pass when it comes to \"gifted\" advantages. For all of the hullabaloo over Renee Richards in the 70s, she didn't get past the 3rd round in the women's US Open and lost in the 1st round thrice.\n\nThere's a lot of talk about trans women having higher bone density and muscle-to-fat ratio, and though I'm not a physiologist by any means, I think those are valid concerns. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is lung capacity and skeletal structure, both of which can provide distinct advantages to a trans woman in competition against cis women, especially in track and field. Again, I think the difference between a genetic \"gift\" and a genetic \"unfair advantage\" is really vague, but the advantage that a trans woman could have here is rather large.\n\nOne thing I'd love to see, however, is a longitudinal study that would evaluate the athleticism of trans women in some sports or competitions which would wholly evaluate their athletic attributes, from top speed to endurance. It would test their pre-transition selves against a male statistical range (i.e., \"78th percentile among men for top-end speed\"), and their post-transition selves (ideally post-SRS and ~5 years post-HRT) against a female statistical range. Would a pre-transition trans woman who scored in the 78th percentile among men score in the 78th percentile (or somewhere around that number) among women after her transition? Or would her position spike, so that she found herself in the 90th+ percentile among women? I'd love to see this study, and I think it would really settle the question of whether trans women post-transition have a hidden advantage -- provided that a methodology can be developed to compensate for changes in natural fitness, of course. But I don't think mainstream trans people would be very happy.\n\nI've heard a few tucutes say some absolute lunacy like \"trans women should not be forcibly castrated to play in women's sport!\" (presumably to \"include\" the non-dysphorics who don't generally want HRT) but I don't mean that.

I'm glad to see the community is growing here. 2k members! *Wow!* I never thought we'd get even *close*.\n\nBecause of this I thought I'd give a little reminder to the subreddit: please heed rule 3! Every post containing usernames of individuals other than OP (ex: tweets, Tumblr posts, reddit comments/threads) **must have the username censored** or it will be deleted as it is considered a violation of rule 3. Members of both communities, tucute and truscum, have been doxxed and harassed for sharing their beliefs. I have known transmedicalists who were put in the hospital after constant harassment and suicide baiting from tucutes. Please be considerate of the fact that *both sides have bad people.* There are tucutes who will harass transmeds and transmeds who will harass tucutes. So **censor usernames.**  \n\n\nSecondly, I'd like to remind everyone that this subreddit is also an open place for us to discuss things like transition updates, vents, share our artwork, memes, etc.! Everything that we can't do on r/traa, r/asktransgender, and the like because of their mod teams' transphobic values is accepted here. I'll start: I just got on T a few weeks ago! I had my second shot last Wednesday and I'm super excited for what's to come.   \n\n\nFinally, I'd like to list a bit of terminology for anyone who's recently joined and is a bit confused.  \nA **tucute** is someone who believes you do not need gender dysphoria to be transgender. They believe, for the most part, that you only need gender incongruence (one of the criterions for dysphoria to be diagnosed) to be transgender. This is due to their belief that incongruence is separate from dysphoria, rather than a part of it. Tucutes also sometimes believe that the 'clinically significant distress' required to be diagnosed as dysphoric means extreme *self-hatred, pain, discomfort, etc.* rather than medically identifiable distress.\n\n  \nA **transcompassionist** is another term for tucute. Just like us truscum coined the term \"transmedicalist\", tucutes coined \"transcompassionist\". It's not very widespread, but some people use it. Some tucutes also use **transmedic**, but I avoid that term because it intentionally confuses people.  \n\n\n**MOGAI** or \"marginalized orientations, genders and intersex\" was a term originally coined as an alternative to LGBT but is now used as an indicator for genders like stargender, autismgender, pangender, and other gender identities aren't widely accepted by the community. Most truscum don't believe in these identities.  \n\n\n**Neopronouns** are sets of gendered pronouns other than he/she/they. Some widely accepted neopronouns are ey/em/eirs (a singular alternative to they/them/theirs) and xe/xer/xers. They can range from fay/fair/fairs to possum/possum/possumself to even emojis.  \n\n\nA **TAP or TAB** is a \"trans appropriating person/bigot\". This is a new term coined for transtrenders.  \n\n\nA **transtrender** is a cisgender person who knowingly pretends to be trans for their own benefit. They usually do this online. Not to be confused with questioning or GNC trans people.  \n\n\nA **TERF** is a trans exclusionary radical feminists. The core belief of this ideology is generally that gender does not exist, therefore trans people cannot exist. *TERFs live on* r/GenderCritical*.

I'm 5'11\", have an angular face with hollow cheeks, and an aquiline nose. I'm in a state where I can kinda pass for a tall, angular faced cis girl if I gender conform and look exactly like a male if I don't.\n\nBasically, what ends up making me pass for female is my hair style and me doing makeup. I'm 2 years HRT, and I can't afford FFS, SRS, implants, voice surgery, etc. I've only done facial and body hair removal, and even then I'm not done yet. I'm going back to school for the purpose of maybe one day making enough money to pay for those things. If I were a cis woman, however, not doing my hair and makeup alone wouldn't get me gendered as male. So it feels like I have to jump through these hoops that I shouldn't have to jump through. Sure, some trans women don't do their makeup and don't have a super feminine haircut, but I feel like I don't have that choice. If I were to use a womens bathroom or go in any women's space (Since I'm legally F, I'm going to be housed with women next year on campus) as the way I look in boymode, I would get stares and would be told I don't belong there. But if I engage in gender stereotypes, then all of a sudden it's okay.\n\nSome of it is just dysphoria. If I were a *real* woman, it wouldn't matter if I didn't wear makeup or had a boyish haircut. But since I'm trans, it does, for the sake of cis women feeling safe around me. But at the same time, I'm perpetuating a stereotype. Sometimes I like to look feminine, but I hate that it's a requirement. I'm attracted to androgynous women myself, but I can't pull it off.\n\nDoes anyone else feel similarly with their gender?", "date": "2019-07-07 07:11:54", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/ca4623/i_feel_like_i_have_to_engage_in_gender/", "author": "transgirltradwife"}, {"title": "A person explains their \"Wario Gender\" I shit you not.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-07-07 14:42:56", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/ca7jqk/a_person_explains_their_wario_gender_i_shit_you/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "The utter state of the \"trans community\"", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-07 22:54:46", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cad6d9/the_utter_state_of_the_trans_community/", "author": "TranimeGirl"}, {"title": "Youd think they'd at least research the people they're trying to debate against right?

I guess this will be my introduction, too. I'm a transsexual woman, and I've gotten to the point in my transition where I've finally been able to cast off the \"trans\" label. Openly, that is. I'm still dealing with enough dysphoria that it helps to have other trans people to talk to, but I've been stealth for several years now, and I'm very grateful for that. My therapist is amazing, too. But I do really have that need sometimes to talk with someone who isn't a psychologist at all, but someone who actually understands on a personal level what dysphoria is and how much it can hurt. I thought that was what the trans community was for... a shared bond over mutual suffering.\n\nBut nope. I've been in this group for a few weeks now, but I honestly didn't see this coming. At all. I don't typically associate with trans communities online or offline so I had no idea what \"tucute\" and \"truscum\" meant. I didn't even know there was a debate. For crying out loud, what makes you transsexual if you don't have dysphoria? Do you just choose it? This group was relatively normal, too. It was pretty strongly leftist, in the annoying \"DESTROY CAPITALISM\" way, but politics mostly stayed out of the chat so I didn't mind that much; everyone was really nice otherwise. Other than that, it was pretty normal. There were a few non-binary people in there (whatever, I don't mind), but most of the group was binary-identifying. It seemed relatively mature, too. Best of all, I could remain completely anonymous.\n\nYeah. I was talking about dysphoria with someone else in one of the channels, but something I said (along the lines of \"being trans sucks\") caught the attention of one of the mods, who jumped in like the Kool-Aid Man and announced that being trans was a *blessing*. I debated with him for a while, but oh, I opened pandora's box when the topic came to dysphoria. I expressed how annoyed I was that dysphoria was being disconnected from transsexuality (I of course used the word \"transgender\"... why is \"transsexual\" such a bad word?) as if they were separate things, and well, that set everything on fire. The mod who'd jumped in at the beginning called me a \"tranmaiden\" (LOL.) and banned me. I had no idea at the time what I'd said that was awful, but it just really annoyed me for the next few minutes.\n\nAfterwards, one of the people from that chat messaged me overwards about this subreddit. I looked through the sub for a bit and read a bit about transmedicalism, and I'm honestly horrified that it's apparently on the fringe like it is.

My mother won't talk about it to this day and I don't think she'll ever be willing to accept me and use the correct name and pronouns. She just ignores it completely. I've distanced myself from her a lot because of it, and having to hide my transition from her has been alienating and awful. \n\nI graduated high school recently. I was pretty much an outcast because I'm trans, and I couldn't come out at school at all except to a select few who were very shitty about it and didn't respect me. I had panic attacks multiple times a day for almost 3 years (as a sophomore, junior and senior) because I'm trans, and I still suffer from crippling anxiety, most of which is directly related to my worries and fears about transitioning. \n\nAll my diplomas have the wrong name on it.\nMy college application has the wrong name on it.\n\nMy biggest worry about college is that I'll have to deal with either being stealth, which is unlikely because I'd have to talk to every single teacher about this so they don't out me, or being very very publicly trans, both of which are terrifying.\n\nI've cut off contact with everyone who doesn't know I'm transitioning who I know wouldn't be okay with it.

It should be in one of those square text boxes in the upper left corner, containing narrator text. Then the two characters, Danielle and Xanadu.\n\nXanadu is shorter, with smaller feet, and a thin/scrawny body. Basically, a guy with a physique that's more feminine than average. Has some chin stubble, bushy eyebrows, and chest/armpit hair. Possibly hairy legs. Basically, a bunch of signs of being male that could have been easily \"fixed\" to be more feminine.\n\nDanielle is the opposite. More meticulous about her appearance, but is quite a bit taller, with a square jaw and visible (but not prominent) Adam's apple (might not be needed depending on style). Her feet are bigger. She's thin, and dresses neatly. Women's jeans with a flower embroidered on them, a feminine belt, a v-neck t-shirt, and flats.\n\n# Panel 1 (Note: first two panels are optional)\n\n*Xanadu is walking towards what's obviously the bathroom of an apartment, where the door has been conspicuously marked with a \"gender neutral\" bathroom sign. She's presenting as male, and wearing male clothes. There are little text signs around her saying \"No oppression!\", \"None at all!\", (frowny face), etc. like the text that pops up when you're playing DDR.*\n\nNarrator: Straight cis male walks into a gender neutral bathroom, and becomes...\n\nXanadu: (irritated at narrator) I'm pangender!\n\n# Panel 2\n\n*Xanadu is walking out of the bathroom, wearing a lopsided wig, a really short tube dress that's barely holding up HUGE silicone breast forms, and super high stiletto heels. Only wearing messy lipstick for makeup. None of it matches. Text signs around her change to read \"Oppression x3!\", \"Much oppression!\", \"Wow!\"*\n\nNarrator: TRANS LESBIAN WOMAN! Seeker of oppression, wherever it lies!\n\n# Panel 3\n\n*Xanadu is in background. In foreground is Danielle, sitting on a couch, holding a laptop. Her legs are together with her feet tucked under her, in a casually feminine pose, [like this](https://www.123rf.com/photo_37534026_beautiful-young-woman-sitting-on-couch-and-looking-at-the-window.html), and she's using a laptop.*\n\nXanadu: Danielle! Can you give me a ride? It's for work!\n\nDanielle: (looks optimistic) Well ... sure! I know how much you've needed a job!\n\n# Panel 4\n\n*Danielle and Xanadu are in a car. Danielle is driving.*\n\nDanielle: (sincerely) You're going to your interview dressed like that? Are you going to tell them your name is \"Brian Phelps\" or \"Xanadu Starscream\"?\n\nXanadu: (annoyed) Don't deadname me!\n\n# Panel 5\n\n*Danielle has parked the car. Xanadu is getting out.*\n\nDanielle: Chuck E. Cheese's? I guess you do enjoy dressing up and acting silly!\n\nXanadu: It's not a job interview ...\n\n# Panel 6\n\n*Similar to the previous panel. Xanadu is fully out of the car.*\n\nXanadu: ... it's for my trans activist blog.\n\nDanielle: (looks horrified)\n\n# Panel 7\n\n*Wide panel, showing the inside of a Chuck E. Cheese's arcade/restaurant. Kids are playing arcade games, and half eaten pizzas are on tables. In one corner is Xanadu, heading across the panel towards the opposite corner. So far, everyone has ignored her. In the opposite corner, barely visible, are two restroom doors. One says \"Boys\", and the other says \"Girls\". They have the standard restroom door symbols on them. Do a Google search for Chuck E. Cheese's if you're unfamiliar with the American arcade/restaurant chain. You can draw the costumed rodent in this panel if you feel like it.*\n\nNarrator: Our heroine sets her gaze on the den where she knows her oppressors lie in wait...\n\n# Panel 8\n\n*Xanadu is bursting into the girl's room, pushing open the door, with a clearly marked \"Girls\" sign, along with the standard restroom door symbol. She's shown from the waist up. The view is from inside the bathroom, looking towards the door, so you can't actually see what's inside in this panel.*\n\nXanadu: (looking menacing) Alright, oppressors! Do your worst!\n\n# Panel 9\n\n*Shot of the inside of the restroom, as seen from Xanadu's perspective. Xanadu is not visible. A bunch of young girls, and two adult women are staring at her in horror.*\n\n# Panel 10\n\n*Similar to panel 8, except Xanadu looks embarrassed.*\n\nXanadu: (sheepishly) Does anyone feel a draft in here?\n\n# Panel 11\n\n*Xanadu is climbing into Danielle's car, clearly shaken. Her wig is askew, and she's holding her shoes and one of her breast forms. The other one has slid down her dress, and looks really weird.*\n\nXanadu: Hurry! Drive! Wardrobe malfunction! No time to explain!\n\nDanielle: (looks scared) What happened!?\n\n# Panel 12\n\n*Danielle is driving, Xanadu is in the passenger seat.*\n\nXanadu: These panties are cisnormative! They were inadequate for concealing my birth defect!\n\nDanielle: (angrily) You EXPOSED YOURSELF to a group of CHILDREN!?\n\n# Panel 13\n\n*Similar to panel 12. Danielle looks really upset.*\n\nXanadu: The manufacturers of these panties are transphobic against non-op trans women! I'm going to file a lawsuit against them!\n\n# Panel 14\n\n*Similar to previous panel, except Danielle is red-faced and livid.*\n\nXanadu: Where did you buy them?\n\n# Panel 15\n\n*View of the car from outside it. A sidewalk is visible. Brakes are screeching.*\n\nDanielle: (from inside the car) GET OUT!!\n\n# Panel 16\n\n*Danielle is out of her car, and facing down Xanadu. Dialog continues between them. This should be broken up into multiple panels.*\n\nDanielle: (furious) You said this was for work!\n\nXanadu: (indignant) It is! How can I write articles for my trans activism blog if people aren't oppressing me?\n\nDanielle: You want oppression, do you? Well how's this? Nobody likes people who act like it's their job to piss people off!\n\nXanadu: TERF!

It's one of the few things about my appearance I can control about myself. \nI've been diagnosed with dysphoria consistently and by multiple mental health professionals for the past 6 years as well. I haven't been able to start medically transitioning, but I present masculine as best as I can, I wear a binder whenever I leave the house, I've been going to the gym in order to help build up muscle mass, and I try my hardest to pass in general. \nI currently have black hair with a section of it being rainbow, which I did myself and based off a character I created several years ago.

I run a medium-sized Instagram account and post Tumblr flops and transmed discourse on it. Because of the amount of followers I have (around 650ish) I have been able to talk to a lot of other discourse accounts as well while I've been running my account.\n\nHowever, recently there's been a shift. So many transmeds on Instagram have now become tucutes and all of a sudden start bashing transmeds for not having sources. All of these people have somehow turned tucute because they debated a tucute who was supposedly able to debunk all their sources. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to give the username of the account, but there's also this one account that basically have a \"source\" doc that every tucute has in their bio, and in their linktree they have a document \"debunking\" sources I put on my profile a while back. However, they decided to debunk version 1 of it six months after I made version 2 on a different document and took version 1 down, which I just find hilarious.\n\nAnyway I mention this source doc because all tucutes use the same sources\u2014 Lambda Legal (a LGBT legal site, not a science site), the APA expert q&amp;a on gender dysphoria, and an NHS page that all say not all trans people have dysphoria. What gets me though is that all these people believe you need gender incongruence which is the same as gender dysphoria.\n\nSo, my main question: why do you think medical sites say you don't need gender dysphoria to be transgender, and what's the best way to debunk these whenever a tucute uses them in a debate?  All these truscum turning into tucutes when it used to be the other way around is kind of getting on my nerves so this is something I'm really looking into a lot.\n\nThanks in advance.", "date": "2019-07-17 02:48:54", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/ce70n2/advice_with_sources/", "author": "LordFundarbyrd"}, {"title": "Going to a psychologist and scared", "text": "So, my mental health has finally gone downhill enough that I\u2019m going to see a psychologist at the beginning of August, and I\u2019m really scared.  I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s going to talk to me and think I have GD.  I\u2019m simultaneously afraid that she\u2019d think that and be wrong, and that she\u2019d think that and be right.  I\u2019ve always been a huge tomboy, which has only increased as I\u2019ve gotten older (much to my mother\u2019s dismay).  I\u2019m probably just GNC, but I\u2019m afraid that I could actually have GD.  I don\u2019t feel like going into a list of all of the things that could be signs because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all sick of seeing those and it would probably be long.  It\u2019s not the TAPs that are making me think this, it\u2019s y\u2019all on this sub.  When I first learned what transgender was, it was in high school from minidocs about people like Jazz Jennings with extreme dysphoria, like the not recognizing yourself in the mirror and wanting to personally cut off your genitalia type.  I briefly wondered if maybe that was me, but thought, \u201cnah, I\u2019d notice if I felt that.\u201d  I figured that because I had felt somewhat similar things before, the last time I wore nail polish I had to take it off almost immediately because I was filled with this eerie feeling that they weren\u2019t my feet, and sometimes I didn\u2019t recognize myself in the mirror if I was wearing bright colors (to be fair, I wore a lot of dark colors and even my friends didn\u2019t recognize me at first if I wore something lighter).  I figured that if I didn\u2019t recognize myself with nail polish or wearing bright colors, I\u2019d surely notice if I didn\u2019t recognize myself with breasts and hips and all of those dumb things.  I mean, I\u2019d probably have been better off as a guy, and just about all women\u2019s stuff, including bodies, either sucks or is a worse version of men\u2019s stuff, but that in itself doesn\u2019t mean I have GD.\n\nI came to this sub to try to balance out all of the TAPs online.  I\u2019ve always been jealous of trans guys and the changes they have, but the last thing I want to do is be a trender and hurt actual trans people who suffer from GD.  They already have it bad enough, the last thing any of them need is someone like me being a dumbass and walking into a trans group like \u201cHow do you do, fellow trans people.\u201d  But I start reading stuff here and thinking, \u201cWhat do you mean GD can be subtler that not recognizing yourself and wanting to self-harm?\u201d\n\nIdk even why TF I\u2019m posting this.  I guess I just need to vent to someone who won\u2019t just call me an egg and maybe offer some reassurance that psychologists aren\u2019t all handing out GD diagnoses like they\u2019re candy.

I've long had the vague impression that trans women are more common than trans men, and a casual google search about percentages seems to indicate that this impression is pretty widely held.\n\nActual publicly available data on the question is pretty scarce, but what's there seems to follow a pattern suggesting that trans women are about three times as common. At the same time, this info seems pretty far from the final word on the matter. For example, from the [gender dysphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria#cite_note-prevalence-41) wiki:\n\n&gt;Gender dysphoria occurs in one in 30,000 male-assigned births and one in 100,000 female-assigned births. ... It is estimated that about 0.005% to 0.014% of people assigned male at birth and 0.002% to 0.003% of people assigned female at birth would be diagnosed with gender dysphoria, based on 2013 diagnostic criteria, though this is considered a modest underestimate. Research indicates people who transition in adulthood are up to three times more likely to be male assigned at birth, but that among people transitioning in childhood the sex ratio is close to 1:1.\n\nThe source for the first two facts in that quote are pretty recent, but aren't publicly available, so I can't verify them. And the final statement is based on a study from the 90s. Generally speaking, the facts on this seem to be hard to get, under-researched or old.\n\nPeople here seem pretty reasonable and thoughtful, so I was wondering what you all think. Do MtFs actually outnumber FtMs 3 to 1? And if so, what are the reasons behind that? Are they biological, cultural or both? Does the transtrender culture nudge more men into claiming \"trans identity\" than women because they're more likely to have a deficit of \"woke points\" they need to fill?

Im on T but what if it comes back...I'd rather fucking die.", "text": "This topic is very triggering, especially to me. Bleeding is one of the biggest dysphoria triggers for me and I haven't actually dealt with it in about a year.  \nI've been on DEPO- Provera for a little over a year now and that stopped most of all my bleeding, sometimes at the half way mark (1.5 months) I would bleed a bit for a few days to a week, and sometimes when my next Depo shot would be 2 weeks away or so, I would full on start to bleed. I got what I would like to be my last Depo shot, the day after my 1st T shot, so by the time I hit 3 months on T, my Depo will have worn off completely and I am scared to DEATH of starting to bleed again. To say it makes me suicidal would sound like an understatement. It's something I can't deal with and it's something I never could deal with ever. To put all of my dysphoria aside, even then when I would get those times, I would physically become so ill that I would throw up and my *cramps* would be so intense that having a heating pad on my abdomen was a necessity, otherwise I would be in so much pain I couldnt move at all without wanting to throw up every organ inside of me.\n\nI'm now 2 month on Testosterone and that 3rd month is coming up and I can already feel the anxiety building up inside of me, I've been so paranoid about it that I've recently been checking to see if its here it's not, thank the fucking gods. These whole 2 months I haven't had any bleeding at all, no spotting, nothing; I am so grateful and I wish that it will not come back ever. But the anxiety is so bad that if anything downstairs feels even slightly weird, I feel my heart drop thinking that I might start bleeding again. My dysphoria about bleeding is so fucking bad that I've considered I might get a hysto before even getting top surgery just because I mentally, emotionally and physically cannot deal with it not even for a second.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOther reasons I don't want to continue DEPO:\n\nOver the entirety of this year+ of being on Depo, my mood as been horrible and my anger is much higher and I've been very short tempered at times - I know that even though I suffer from depression, Depo has negatively effected my mental state because when my Depo would start to run low,  felt much better mentally(etc i could go on but you get it), but my dysphoria towards bleeding and the fact it makes me extremely suicidal and depressed have been the reason I've stayed with it for so god damn long. Also doctors don't recommend staying on Depo for longer than 2 years because it keep nutrients from getting to your bones or something like that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF you have advice that would help me, please share it. I want to raise my dose after these 3 months not just for bleeding to be prevented even more but thats a big reason why, but since I now have a new Endo or should be getting a new endo, I don't think she'll raise my dose for me.  \nI'm just really scared, it's been so long and I can't fucking deal with this bullshit.", "date": "2019-07-19 23:40:56", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cff0eo/twhow_do_i_deal_with_bleeding_im_on_t_but_what_if/", "author": "uwuakley"}, {"title": "Bruh moment", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 03:24:38", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfh6rj/bruh_moment/", "author": "your_stupied"}, {"title": "LOL", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 03:28:21", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfh819/lol/", "author": "darknep"}, {"title": "the story is likely fake but look at the comments. seems like everyone's going \"why would you transition without dysphoria\"", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 04:44:19", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfhwk3/the_story_is_likely_fake_but_look_at_the_comments/", "author": "exnihilocreatio"}, {"title": "It\u2019s less fun and more work going MtF than it is going FtM", "text": "Monday to Friday vs Friday to Monday.", "date": "2019-07-20 12:18:09", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfl7ap/its_less_fun_and_more_work_going_mtf_than_it_is/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Unsubbed like why would anyone say this unless they want to be special", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 15:12:51", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfmuvb/unsubbed_like_why_would_anyone_say_this_unless/", "author": "theycallmeanxiety"}, {"title": "hey posted in another sub about terfs vs tucute types, are yall friendly to discussion on this", "text": "hey yo was gud i'm looking for real talk but casual if possible, nice cool shit, dgaf. we all chill. my question is: do you think these two groups feed off of each other due to similarities drawing from as someone said recently critical feminist theory and what's your take on the military ban on trans people who have dysphoria/medically transition but NOT banning so called non dysphoric trans people, will such rules open up the door to more serious legal discrimination against for instance transsexuals while allowing nondysphoric trans* people thru the cracks, or am i like fuckin paranoid? also heard some shit about how they(in us, us govt) wanna force people to identify themselves not only by legal gender after completed/legal transition but want people to have to say their assigned sex/gender on forms n shit. is this serious, is it related to the \"\"\"tucute\"\"\"(sorry idk what else to call it) movement, or is it largely nothing to be concerned about? is looking for protection from govt dumb shit and we should just rise tf up? something else? never posted on truscum/transmed forums since i was a kid bc of the cancel culture type of shit. mostly stayed on like, the transsexual forums on susans place and like hudsons ftm guide lol... dunno. thoughts? thanks bros and also non bros. :]", "date": "2019-07-20 20:28:09", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfqgk3/hey_posted_in_another_sub_about_terfs_vs_tucute/", "author": "tomdawg98"}, {"title": "Reposting cus my dumbass forgot to censor names but still", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 20:39:51", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfql98/reposting_cus_my_dumbass_forgot_to_censor_names/", "author": "theycallmeanxiety"}, {"title": "Blaire White debate w/ non-binary activist", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 21:46:42", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfrbyo/blaire_white_debate_w_nonbinary_activist/", "author": "ShinyMet"}, {"title": "My ftm friend seems like a trender", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-07-20 22:42:14", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfrx5o/my_ftm_friend_seems_like_a_trender/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "It's Really Obvious to See Fetishists Pretending to be trans when they post disgusting stuff like this :/", "text": "", "date": "2019-07-20 22:58:37", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cfs3c2/its_really_obvious_to_see_fetishists_pretending/", "author": "serpior"}, {"title": "My friend seems like a trender", "text": "I recently realised I\u2019m ftm and confided in a friend who is also ftm and out for almost a year.

Almost every trans FTM person I see online  either still has the emotional range of a woman, talks like a woman, and even acts like a woman! Even when I read texts or articles written by trans men (not always but most of the time) I can't picture the writer as a man. Sometimes I'll just see the dude as maybe like a feminine gay guy, but still, that shit just gets on my nerves like fucking hell! There's just no escaping it, no room for fresh air or a fucking break from the hyper feminism these trans men exude! Sometimes I just can't help but wonder WHY these people even fucking transitioned to begin with if they were gonna just act like girls all over again! What the fuck bro!? And don't even mention the deplorable shit on FTMpunished, I already know too well and it's just the biggest mindfuck imaginable!\n\nAnd just to make shit clear, I'm not saying you can't be effeminate as a trans guy. The thing that just makes me the most fucking irate is that the trans community tries to make every person they come in contact with conform to this prissy, unbearable form of feminity. If so many trans men want to be viewed as nothing other than any other male, WHY do they still act like feminine little girls? Is it just a reminant of a past life of the living as the opposite sex? Is it the conditioning of the queer community or the influence of feminists?? Dude I'm sorry, I just can't bring myself to relate to many mainstream trans guys on YouTube, their behavior and aura they exhibit is nothing other than foreign to me... I just can't see most of the FTMs benefitting or sustaining their transition! Just look at Chase Ross and his plethora and myriad of mental health woes! That dude is fucking whacked!! Neo fascism is the real sickening form of cancer weakly disguised as humanitarianism!\n\nEven Aydian Dowling, the physical epitome of what every trans dude would give a piece of their asses to be,  puts me off with his weird ass views and opinions. Not to mention he also calls his kid a \"they\", fuck that just made me so pissed (not the point of this post, I know, no bitching)! Him and others alike work for their physical aesthetic to look like the strong and unbelievable men they feel they deserve to be, all to just emotionally revert back to femalish ways of thinking and speaking and ways of viewing the world.\n\nAs much as I feel like a piece of degenerate shit for admitting this, there's been a lot of FTMs that I've seen that I only can percieve as confused females in androgenized bodies. I know it sounds callous and I wish I could switch the gears in my head on the issue, I don't see a way away from that perception I have of them though. All the more reason I have to stress that transition is becoming WAY to available to point of other peoples' detiments! Where is a proper and solid shiny beautiful gate when you fucking need one the most?! Cuz honestly, these fucking people should've figured out a different way to resolve their problems! Without the queer, lesbian or trans support groups, friends or communities, these FTMs wouldn't be able to handle living in the man's world in my eyes! So sorry, maybe it may just be that I've had very little female socialization that I can't stand hearing some trans men call themselves men just because they look like it but aren't in any other aspect at all. Hell, maybe it's just me who's got a fucking screw loose!\n\nThe only trans men I can relate to are the baby boomer men, because most times I get the vibe that they don't subscribe to being an overly feminine sort of FTM and they just live their fucking lives as individuals. I know there are younger people here and on this planet who are legitimately like bio guys, but frankly, I'm just losing hope in this generation of halfnhalf FTMs.\n\nAnd don't be calling me an internalized transphobe! I very much appreciate where my transition has taken me and I would not trade it for the world! I've gotten so fuckin lucky! I have no shame and I wish nothing but the best for everyone going through the painful process of becoming their authentic reincarnation. But, not all are meant to sail the ship for the Long haul.

Ensure the person has the correct information they need to be able to make a proper decision on whether they want to transition or just not follow their expected gender role/expression.\n\nI'm one that believes transsexuals are the binary portion of transgender folk, the ones that know they're not fit with identifying with what they were born as. Whereas transgender encompasses both the binary and nonbinary. Transitioning medically, just socially, or both.\n\n(Beginning this discussion, because I responded to someone else with this &amp; they ended up leaving the group we shared in common.

He wore some skirts here and there and dressed slightly more feminine, even painting his nails sometimes, he tried to pass, I became accustomed to seeing my friend as a girl. After like 3 months he told me he felt more non-binary, but the whole transgirl era ended in him telling *coming to the* ***\"conclusion\"*** that since science doesn't prove that there's more than 2 genders that that means he's not trans. And yes that's inherently transphobic because being transgender doesn't mean there's a 3rd gender (for being binary trans). Pretty much the day right after he came out as just being a cis gay guy, he wore this jacket that pretty much symbolized masculinity, it's hard to explain exactly but he hadn't worn the jacket for those months because he said it was too manly and he would get deadnamed a lot in it and also because it made him boxy. So pretty much that day when I saw him come strutting back into school dressed like a dude 100% again I felt this weird feeling inside, like wow so it was all a lie? Those entire months were nothing to you? Wow. I couldn't just shift right then and there to seeing my friend as a guy...again, but I did get use to it after a bit.  \nFast forward to a few months after that, maybe 4 months later he came out as non-binary. For maybe the first few weeks, he attempted to look androgenous and to sort of present with his identity, he would sometimes wear girls pants, feminine shirts and every once in a while he would wear mascara, personally, I think it made his eyes pop in a nice way. After maybe a month of actually trying to pass he pretty much just gave up, he wears the same pants and shirt every day, went through a long period of not even shaving his face correctly, leaving sideburns. What I'm getting at his he just started to present himself as a male again. I have nothing against non-binary people at all, especially when they're actually dysphoric. The non-binary people I've met in person, at school and online all look at least partly non-bianry, from those that i've met they all try to pass and they all usually act like their identity - non-binary. \n\nHe doesn't shave his legs, armpits, stomach, sometimes he even forgets to shave his face; and no I'm not saying that you must do this as a non-binary person, but it is something you kind of expect by someone who claims to be genderless. He is comfortable with his shirt off, he's comfortable with his dick and balls, constantly feeling the need to randomly talk about how special the male scrotum is (no, im not kidding and yes this makes me personally dysphoric and feel like shit to say the least). He's open about masturbating constantly.\n\nI can only recall two times that I have EVER heard him say anything about his dysphoria and the times that I did hear it, it was for a single second and there was nothing more to be said. One of the times he even claimed he had crippling dysphoria, now thinking of that I just fucking laugh. I know my friend very well. I'd even say we were best friends up until he got into a fight with me, so most of these things I'm saying have been things I've thought about deeply. When he said he was trans I did my best to let him know I can help with whatever he needed, yet he took no advice and he took none of my help.   \nHis family is like mine, separated, tough, but somewhat loving, I know he wouldn't get beated or kicked out. He uses his dad as a scapegoat, saying stuff like *if i wear nailpolish my dad wont like it*, *if i get my ears pierced, my dad wont like it*, *if i wear a skirt, my dad wont like it,*  \nTo me, these are excuses. This to me just shows that he isnt actually trans, because trans people cant just suck it up and move on, if we do we just end up so much worse than we were, so unhappy and miserable. I had to have MULTIPLE FIGHTS with my mom and my dad for me to be where I am. I had to fucking fight just to have my hair cut short, to be *allowed* to stop shaving my legs, to be *allowed* to dress more like a boy. I was never *allowed* or just handed these things that I needed, I worked hard for it.\n\nHe wears this trans label on him to seem cool or to seem different.  \nWhere's the dysphoria? Where's the effort to be yourself, if you are even trans?  \nI've even talked to him about it before and he said he never experienced anything when he was younger that would make him think he's trans.  \nHe even misgendered himself constantly and calls himself a boy and a male and a man.  \nAnd here we are months later and he's the same and at this point I'm so fed up it's unbelievable. Over the past year I've taken so many personal strides in my own transition and I've gone through so much bullshit and depression and suicidality that his identity is a joke to me at this point. My dysphoria gets worse every day and it makes my life a living hell, to say that i've missed out on most of my life because of it, would be an understatement.  \nI'm rightfully fed up and pissed off. I'm just so fucking tired of him making a mockery out of what the trans struggle really is.\n\nMy friend goes by they/them pronouns and that's it. He loves his dick and balls, he's OK with being misgendered, he's perfectly fine with being seen as a male and being treated as one. He puts no effort to pass at all. None. He's your state-of-the-art cis looking male and he acts way more masculine than any of my other cis friends.  \nDear friend, you pretending to be trans is just hurting your actually trans friend.", "date": "2019-07-23 05:34:22", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cgohxw/stop_pretending_youre_trans_when_youre_fucking_not/", "author": "uwuakley"}, {"title": "Was told I am not trans.

Your binary gender depends on your gender identity in my opinion, not on your sex characteristics.\n\nI hate how Asktransgender tells people \u201cif you want to be a woman, then you are a woman\u201d without asking the individual why they feel this way. It\u2019s almost like an advertisement: &lt;&lt;Hey, come and be trans with us, everyone is welcome to trans with us&gt;&gt; . They ignore that these are serious medical treatments.\n\nI felt like I was a girl internally from very young age. It was something innate. Something that I didn\u2019t decide upon. Something that was already there before the mass media started to focus on it.\n\nI prefered the times before transgenderism was mediatized so much. I felt better about myself when my identity wasn\u2019t seen as a trend. With the mediatization the acceptance for transgender people is declining in my opinion. Cis people see a trend of everyone identifying as trans out of the blue and the medical condition \u201ctranssexuality\u201d was hollowed out to the point of it rather being a fashionable statement these days than a serious medical condition.\n\nTucutes make it sound much more fun than it actually is.\nThis will cause me anxiety the rest of my life. I will carry my transsexuality with me till my last breath. This is not something that disappears like tucutes want it make to seem. Hormone treatments and surgery can reduce gender dysphoria but the self-awareness that one is trans never goes away. It sticks with you. It\u2019s a chronic medical condition that is made more bearable with medical treatment but is not completely nuked by it. At least not in my opinion. Not in my experience.\nI definitely feel better since I started HRT 4 years ago but I still don\u2019t like being trans. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m proud of.\nIt\u2019s not an accomplishment. \n\nPart of that is because I know what cis people think about trans people. In private circles they discuss us as mentally ill, as emotionally unstable. \nI prefer to hide me being trans. I know that I\u2019m and will always be trans, but not everyone has to be made aware of that.\n\nHow can you be proud of a stigmatized medical condition?\nThat\u2019s as backwards as saying : &lt;&lt; I\u2019m proud of being HIV positive. AIDS is beautiful &gt;&gt; .\n\nI hate what the movement has become. I\u2019m so ashamed to discuss trans matters with cis people because I know that they don\u2019t take transgenderism / transsexuality serious anymore if you see who decides to come out out of the blue.\n\nThe media figures who come out as trans make it all seem like it\u2019s about cute dresses and bows in your hair and giggling with the girls as soon as you popped your first E-pill.\n\nI see being trans as a burden on my life. \n\nI hate the leftist approach to trans matters. \nAccusing cis men and cis women who don\u2019t want to date us of being transphobic. I\u2019m sorry but I don\u2019t agree with that. I will always be different from a cis woman biology wise.\nI will forever be trapped in a body that doesn\u2019t match my mental sex. The only thing that science can do for me is readjust that body as much as possible to the sex I feel like.\nBut they can never totally make me that sex physically. There will always be differences. So I can\u2019t blame cis hetero men if me being trans is a dealbreaker because frankly it\u2019s a dealbreaker for me too. So why would I call someone else out on it for thinking the same?\n\nIt flabbergasts me when I see how easy people who never had a notion of gender dysphoria all of a sudden declare themselves trans these days. How easily they consider SRS.\nMany of these people are people who miss something in their life and want to fill that empty gap by transitioning.\nBecause transitioning gives them a goal. It gives the unmotivated motivation towards a goal. And once they reached that goal, their problems start again.\nThat\u2019s why tucute ultra leftist subs are dangerous.\nIt encourages people who are not trans in the brains, who didn\u2019t feel like a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body - who didn\u2019t already identify as women before discovering that being trans was what it was called - to transition.\nThat\u2019s why the suicide rates are so high. Because people for who transitioning isn\u2019t suitable are encouraged to transition.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that the amount of trans people who come out has grown because of social acceptance. I believe that it has grown because a large portion of those who come out as trans are misguided about what being trans entails.\n\nLast week I was reading on a trans sub for tucutes, ultra leftists, that a 21 year old person who had had SRS 7 months ago regretted their entire transition. This person stated to have even more dysphoria after than before. This person claimed to &lt;&lt; not be unhappy as a boy and being pretty good at it &gt;&gt; and they had SRS because &lt;&lt; meh, it\u2019s free &gt;&gt;. \nThis is where our movement stands. Transitioning has been made so casual that people for who a transition isn\u2019t appropriate do irreversible things and then discover only after that they were misguided.\nAnd then some wonder why we need gatekeepers?\n\nBecause those of us who have a female brain sex will easily pass the gatekeeper tests. \nI am not afraid to see a gatekeeper for my SRS referal letters. I am who I claim to be. So why would I be afraid to pass the test?\n\nThose who are afraid to pass the test, are afraid because they have no notion about what being trans in the classic actual sense is. \n\nI\u2019m so tired of ultra leftist tucute subs.\n\nThis is a medical condition that only affects a few people out of a whole bunch of people. These days there are just too many who claim to be trans. 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 30 000 people assigned male at birth will turn out to be true transsexuals according to the earlier research. These days 1 in 100 to 1 in 300 people assigned male at birth claim to be some flavor of trans.\n\nIt just isn\u2019t right. There are not more actual trans people ( who were born this way and for who this is a medical condition ) now than 20 years ago. There are just more people who appropriate a trans identity because they are misled and misguided.\n\nI didn\u2019t need the internet to know what I am. I already knew before I had access to internet. That\u2019s why I\u2019m always so shocked that some claim that they came to the realization of being trans after stumbling on an internet article. I already had my sense of inner womanhood before I even knew what internet was.\nBeing trans is not something you learn to be, yet there are so many today who claim they \u201c discovered themselves \u201c thanks to the internet.\n\nThere is so many things wrong with the trans community nowadays. To begin with that the vast majority of the trans community are not true medical transsexuals born this way.\nFor most it is learned behavior. \n\nI\u2019m glad that subs like this one still exist.\nTired of satyre subs like Asktransgender.", "date": "2019-07-23 13:46:04", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cgst3m/my_take_on_the_trans_community_of_today_the_ultra/", "author": "GoldSilverAndPlatina"}, {"title": "Can someone explain NB dysphoria please?", "text": "Hi There!

All this I believe is taking form because of the lack of a properly maintained gatekeeping system that the trans community for whatever reason refuses to put into action!\n\nI'm sorry, but a trans women cannot be more of a woman than a biological woman! Trans women are biologically male, who while can very much be like a female in so many aspects, will remain XY individuals for the remainder of their lives (very most likely)! There is not shame, wrongness, or anything bad about that fact! In fact, lets be real here, being biologically the opposite of which you are isn't THAT bad once you find stable footing in your male/female identity! \n\nWe, as TRUE transsexuals, DO NOT at all resemble peeps such as JY, autogynephilic males, or characatures of females! Trans women are not characatures, MTFs want nothing more but to pass simply as female and to not draw any negative attention to themselves or cause trouble! THAT is what sets them apart from JY and the likes of him! JY WANTS the attention, real trans people just want to live smooth, decent and productive lives as any other respectable member of this society and be left alone to do so as they please! \n\nSo please, if any other person who may be reading this as a non-trans human being, PLEASE DO NOT  look at JY and lump him in with the rest of the trans population! \n\nAs for my trans brothers and sisters, we NEED to sign a petition for gatekeeping and exclusion for our community as to not allow people like JY, violent non-passing and AGP trans people any access or representation of the trans community!!! The community is becoming a place of hiding and a cesspool for those who wish to do harm unto innocent people and in particular, children!

At least he had the decency to make less of a spectacle of himself... mostly.  \n\n\nThis went down in Houston.  My boyfriend is FtM.  Pre transition, he was from a fundamentalist religious family and he was trying to do what he thought his duty was: go out there, find some man, get married and have lots of babies.  But he also knew he was attracted to women.  He met a crossdresser and thought, ok, maybe this can be a nice medium between the two and we can make this work; he could live up to his parents expectations and be with someone he might be able to find attractive.  You know what happened, though: it didn't work out.    \n\n\nThis crossdresser was just something else.  He has another name, but bf and I just call him \"the monster\" now.  There are so many stories I could tell about him.    \n\n\nBf moved in with this guy pretty quick, not because he wanted to live with him, but because he wanted to get away from his parents (having to wear a dress to church every sunday was a nightmare).  He couldn't bring himself to sleep with the guy, though, so he slept on a couch while the guy got the bed.  What I saw was that this guy is a predatory and was preying on someone with self esteem issues.    \n\n\nHe never stopped bugging bf to sleep with him; and he demanded the sex be without a condom despite having herpes.  He later convinced someone who was slightly mentally retarded to have sex with him, again, without a condom.   \n\n\nEven when he was in a relationship, he tried to sleep with other people.  He would tell his partner to just accept it.  Most of those people he would sleep with were other men.   \n\n\nHe went to meet a friend of bf's and within the first five minutes of meeting the friend and going into her apartment, he stripped completely naked.  \n\n\nOn more than one occassion, he was drunk and masturbating and shouting directions at bf because he needed to get somewhere and was to drunk to drive.\n\nHe insisted on visiting bf's family while he was dressed.  The way he looked when dressed made JY look like a supermodel.  Bf actually called 911 to report himself being kidnapped.  \n\n\nBf was trying to do homework for college and he decided to bring over some guy to masturbate with him while he watched porn.  \n\n\nHe would masturbate in view of his toddler aged son.    \n\n\nThere was a crossdressers group in Houston and they would meet up every Wednesday and do a little pot luck get together.  He always ate more than anyone else but never contributed any food.  \n\n\nSome of the creepy sexual behavior finally stopped when he realized he might be able to get bf to sleep with him if he got on hormones.  He went on hormones, didn't like the reduction in sex drive/function and stopped.  He never recovered from hormone induced erectile disfunction (this is a good thing!).  \n\n\nMaybe the worst scenario?  See, now, all that other stuff didn't get him kicked from the community.  This last stunt finally did.  The first Friday of every month, we had a cookout at the center.  It was a nice little social get together, decent food, stuff like that.  Of course the monster would show up since he can pig out without having to pay.  And, of course, he was crossdressing.  Thing is, he didn't seem to understand women's clothes very well.  I mean, a lot of crossdressers have a nasty habit of being a bit on the slutty/skanky side with their choice of clothes, but the monster took it to a new level.  Short skirt?  Oh, no, a short skirt was too much.  He just got a very long blouse and wore the whole thing like a dress.  Did I mention he wasn't wearing any underwear?  Did I mention that he didn't bother to cross or even close his legs?  The entire night, everyone was given full view of his junk.  Someone thought, 'you know what, I'm guessing he doesn't realize what he's doing and he'll stop when we tell him.'  Nope.  Someone told him and he responded with \"If you don't want to see it, just don't look.\"    \n\n\nThis went on for a couple of the cookouts before someone had to take him aside and tell him he wasn't invited to anymore of them.    \n\n\nThe community in Houston was absolutely amazing and they really helped me get my life together.  I can't entirely criticize them.

I asked her if she did *activity that has upset me in the past* she said no, that i would be 10x madder. I asked \u201cdid you tell my secret, with the biggest pit in my stomach.

You could easily tell that this person was severely mentally ill and dissociating all the time. \nTransition for this person was not a right option. They were still severely , obviously mentally ill post-transition. \nI personally think that psychiatrists let this poor person transition because suggesting therapy would have potentially cost them their job with the political correctness these days.\n\nThere is a trend of people with underlying mental disorders transitioning and no one dares to speak up because \u201c politically incorrect\u201d .\n\nWhy do psychiatrists who swore the Oath Of Hippocrates, let people harm themselves like this?\n\nMPD should be a contra-indication when someone seeks transition.\nThese people permanently dissociate, yet they are given autonomy to decide over irreversible body treatments.\n\nWhen I transitioned, in the early to mid-2000s, schizophrenics and people with multiple personality disorders were filtered out and treated with psychotherapy instead.

They brought this upon themselves after all.\nIt\u2019s the mentally ill who are allowed to and even encouraged to transition, that should set on our alarm bells!\n\nI fear for hormone-therapy access in the next coming decades. Reason why I\u2019m going to have genital surgery after all. Better to be a menopausal woman with no hormones than revert to a male physique because a few people for who transition was not suited, took up all resources and filed law suits when they discovered they made a mistake.\n\nLaisser Faire , laisser passer will seriously backfire! \n\nTwo months ago I was talking to a trans woman who openly admitted to not have a female identity.

Those who were born versus those who are self made.\n\nThere are people on the transfeminine spectrum whose voice and femininity is natural and therefore they blend in. Because the femininity is not a costume. Blaire White is an example of this. Perfectly feminine voice, mannerisms are only slightly exaggerated and mostly natural. Her way of thinking shows a feminine mind. \n\nThe clothing choice also reveals what type of trans person one is.\nThe ones who dress like \u201cglitter sluts\u201d are driven by their libido. By a masculine way of thinking. Either a male homosexual nature or a male heterosexual nature. \n\nTrans women who are neurologically female don\u2019t stand out from their way of dressing from the very beginning. \nThey don\u2019t need to be taught how to dress like a woman. Because we instinctively know.\n\nI think Blanchard was too basic in his typology. I have also noticed males with a homosexual nature transitioning to female without having a true neurological female gender identity. Gigi Gorgeous is a person of that type.\nThese people exaggerate their femininity just as much as the heterosexual males without a feminine mind, who transition to female. They just mask it in a different way.\n\nIn fact I have seen AGPs who pass better than HST-pseudo-MtFs. \nJae Noel and India Willoughby versus Juno Dawson.\n\nI believe there are lesbian trans women who are neurologically of the female type versus heterosexual trans women who are neurologically of the male type and lesbian trans women who are neurologically of the male type versus hetero trans women who are neurologically of the female type.\n\nBlanchard was wrong in his thinking that every lesbian trans woman is neurologically male and every heterosexual trans woman neurologically female.\n\nA lesbian trans woman like Chelsea Manning is neurologically female in my opinion while a heterosexual trans woman like Brianna Wu is neurogically male. You just notice in their nature. I don\u2019t think one\u2019s sexual orientation says something about the genuineness of one\u2019s transsexuality.\n\nThe degree in which one transitions also doesn\u2019t necessarily say something about one\u2019s neurological make-up. Courtney Act ( Shane Jenek ) is neurologically female and has natural femininity, not performed femininity.

I watched a lot of trans-content creators on YouTube, read books and watched movies with transgender characters.  I was pretty convinced that I was trans, but my mom was having none of it. The next few years were incredibly stressful and traumatizing (although those words could almost describe my entire childhood), and I almost forgot about my gender identity issues.\n\nAbout a year ago is when my anxieties surrounding gender resurfaced. I can't walk outside without looking at girls and feeling intense envy. Girls clothing gives me a high that men's clothing never gave me. I feel more like a daughter than a son. I feel more like a sister than a brother. I feel more like a mother than a father. I feel more like a wife than a husband. My body hair bothers me. My deeper voice bothers me. My Adam's Apple bothers me.\n\nMy sexuality is as confusing as my gender identity. I use to resent people's evident assumption than I was gay. I didn't think I was gay, but I also constantly worried about BEING gay. My first crushes were on girls. As I've been doing a lot of introspective analysis of my past and present feelings, I'm beginning to think I am attracted to guys, but as a girl. I didn't like being thought of as gay because I didn't like the thought of being a *man*. I don't like the thought of being a man.\n\nI've talked to people from many different subreddits. Those from r/transgender and r/MtF either say that I am trans or that only I can answer that question. Those from r/detrans say that I am certainly NOT trans, and I worry a lot about de-transitioning. What if I'm not really transgender and I de-transition??!! I don't want to end up de-transitioning! I want to get it right the first time.\n\nEdit: I so desperately want to transition. I WANT to be a woman. No; I am a woman. Also, I see a therapist on a regular basis. He encourages me to explore my gender identity, but he says that the difference between someone who has cross-gender fantasies and doesn't transition and someone who has cross-gender fantasies and does transition is the difference between admiring envy and possessive envy.

This is just my point of view but I believe you can't change your gender or sex. To be clear I define gender as your brain and mind being male, female, or nonbinary. Sex is the body of a person, their hormones, secondary sex characteristics, genitalia, and chromosomes. \n\nSo obviously people don't choose their gender. The science behind transgenderism is that our brains have male or female characteristics opposed to our bodies that are the opposite of our brain. I'm guessing it's similar for nonbinary people, their brains are androgynous where as their bodies are male or female (unless they're intersex). But there is little to no evidence for that yet. And because we're born with this brain structure we can't just change our brain. A male to female woman doesn't just decide to change her brain to female and hormones don't change your brain structure completely. You're born with your gender and can't change it. \n\nNow, sex is a little more complicated. We are born with our bodies. But those who transition, even fully, with hormones, breast/top surgery, bottom surgery, and FFS aren't changing their sex completely. Yes, we are changing aspects of our biology such as hormones, secondary sex characteristics, and even genitalia, but the chromosomes stay the same. Despite all the alternations our bodies were still born as male, female, or intersex. Perhaps someone who has transitioned with hormones, breast/top surgery, and bottom surgrey can't be fully considered biologically what they were born as, but there are still reminiscents of it. \n\nNow, this doesn't mean I don't think people shouldn't be able to change their gender/sex marker legally. It doesn't make any sense for someone passing as their gender to keep their sex on legal documents. In reality, the only people that need to know you're trans is your doctor and significant other. \n\nSo yeah, those are my thoughts. This also explains why I don't necessarily like the term transgender, because I'm not changing my gender, I'm trying to change my sex, to the most possible extent. But using transsexual also feels kinda weird cause it's an older term and everyone just uses transgender nowadays.", "date": "2019-07-28 02:58:39", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/ciqqy1/you_cant_change_gender_or_sex/", "author": "Matt_Flanagan"}, {"title": "Ugh..

Also the 'well its in other cultures' is an argument im not even going to entertain because in other cultures at some points slavery has been normal and accepted, just because something exists in another culture doesnt mean its a good thing.

Even though I would like to think my dysphoria is real I still doubt myself severely. I have also gotten ahold of TERF propaganda and now I have a fear of rapid onset dysphoria. For some background on me, I have felt like a boy since either kindergarten or first grade. One neighbor that was a friend of my mother\u2019s said that me and my older sister were like brother and sister and I remember that feeling right. When my breasts started developing a few years later I freaked out and was hysterical. I ran upstairs and started crying. My mom said she would get me sports bra and said it would flatten my chest a bit. I was so relieved and ended up wearing three at a time to make my chest look completely flat and I always slouched while walking and sitting to hide my chest. I tried to pee standing up and was upset to learn I didn\u2019t have the right equipment to do it. I went through a period of my life where I completely forgot transitioning because my life was pretty busy and oddly enough I didn\u2019t view my obviously female body as female, I just viewed it as a male body that wasn\u2019t properly formed, which I doubt a cis woman would do. I also would make up scenarios in my head and view myself in third person, like I was reciting or acting for a play. Like I would jokingly call myself she or woman but, not because I felt like one because like I said I was just calling myself that when talking to people who only know me as female. More of a social convenience thing. Also being called she did not bother me because I still viewed myself as male and felt male. My stance was I\u2019m a dude regardless of what people say. If I called my dad mom, that doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s still dad and still male, I thought the same for me. Fast forward a few years my dysphoria if you can even call it that moved onto my body again after years of being mainly just social. I cried every time I spoke and would self harm. I hated how high and feminine my voice was. I also wore a v neck one time and looked down, saw cleavage and cried. I also felt very upset and envious at my male classmates who were now over 6 ft tall, had bass in their voice, had facial hair ect. I was upset I never went through male puberty. I can think of other instances but, you get the picture. Though, nowadays my dysphoria if it even is, had gone pretty silent for awhile and that\u2019s starting to scare me. I get mental images of me as a girl wearing a bikini or a girl in general and freak out.  I would have thoughts about how much easier it would be to accept myself as I was born and again I freak out and feel very depressed, on edge, anxious, ect. I daydream about being on T and for the most part I feel very happy in those daydreams. Once I snap out of it I\u2019m pretty frustrated at still being in this body and not being on T. Hell, I had a dream I was on T and my voice dropped. Quite disappointed that was merely a dream. I\u2019m on a trans discord and when I hear other trans people talk about their appointments and hormones I get filled with rage and jealousy and have to hang up. Mostly because I never got to experience that. Im scared I\u2019m just doing all this because I\u2019m really a cis girl trying to be special. For the record I am 17 years old and have been officially diagnosed with dysphoria years ago. I\u2019m freaking out right now because I don\u2019t want to be fake and appropriate a label that doesn\u2019t belong to me. I think faking a condition like this is shitty and I want to know from legit trans people if that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I can\u2019t stop feeling like a liar.

Last year, I broke up with my trans gf. I rebounded on my best friend, a cis guy who has known me for over ten years. In September, we did mushrooms together in the desert at night in the middle of nowhere and we ended up fooling around.\n\nWe were together for about two months. I was living with him at his place. Things were okay, but I wasn't doing well for multiple reasons. He wants nothing more for himself, he's content with working the same job for the rest of his life, not pursuing an education, not being able to make ends meet and then some. It was stagnation. I knew this about him beforehand, so I shouldn't have got involved in the first place.\n\nMyself, I'm going to school and getting my degree in social work. I'm always trying to improve my music and mixing skills. I want a future where the apartment doesn't smell and my partner motivates me and I them. I can't have that with my friend, I know I can't, it will never be that way with him.\n\nFast forward, I broke it off officially in January. For a few months, we definitely still had some feeling for each other. Now that it's summer, I have basically nothing left for him in that regard, which is good. But I've noticed a cute picture of me in a dress is still on his phone, like the main screen.\n\nHe has also made some sexual comments about me out of the blue, which I don't know how to feel about.\n\nHelp a girl out here, how do I talk to him about this?

(The keyword here being decent.)The STP is shaped like a funnel, with the balls being the cup you pee in and the phallus acting as a funnel.As far as peeing with it goes, it\u2019s not like other STPs where you\u2019ll be spending a week practicing in the shower before you feel safe enough to use it in public without having an accident. What I like about using this packer is that it\u2019s straight-forward. I aced it on the first try.\\*How to Use: the balls or base of the funnel is big enough to fit over the entirety of the vagina. The base of the penis should be nestled against your pubic mound. If you can look down and see the balls, it\u2019s too far up. If only 3 inches of the penis is showing and you can feel the cup against your anus, it\u2019s too far back.\\*With your pants pulled all the way down, you shouldn\u2019t make any messes on your first try.*Tip: be aware of where the funnel/phallus is pointing or you\u2019ll end up almost peeing on the wall like I did.*\n\n**PACKING**  \n\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for hyper-realism, this packer ain\u2019t it. Though I\u2019m sure you\u2019re already aware of that. However for 15 dollars the detailing on the balls and phallus are great, honestly.The top complaint I hear about this packer is that it packs like shit; they\u2019re all correct. It does, in fact, pack like shit.The silicone can be trained down, but since the packer is made with a seam down the middle, to extend the life of the product, I advise against packing it that way. While it\u2019s easier to pack it in boxer briefs vs. boxers, if you\u2019re like any other guy who wears skinny jeans- you\u2019ll be fine. Trust me.\n\nThere are about 3 ways to pack with it:\n\n1. Upwards, with the balls on your right thigh and the phallus resting between the crevice of your left thigh and pubic mound.(I usually pack it this way, but the silicone isn\u2019t soft enough- I\u2019m still aware that it\u2019s there if I move.)\n2. Downwards, the phallus trained downwards and the cup sitting sideways at your pubic mound. (this one looks weird if you\u2019re looking at in in your underwear, but the bulge is realistic and it\u2019s not uncomfortable)\n3. Downwards, the phallus trained down over the balls. (this way seems more comfortable than the rest, but because of the seam and stiff silicone, I advise against packing it this way.)Overall, this is a decent product for those who want their first packer and are on a tight budget. It\u2019s a great STP and while packing with it takes patience, it isn't impossible.\n\n*Additional notes: If you use the code CHASE18 you can get a small discount off your packer on ftmessentials which may, or may not be for a limited time only.The packaging on the STP advertises itself as a pack- and-play but  ftmessentials advises against it.*\n\n*If you're African American, this packer doesn't come in any color darker than \"chocolate.\"*", "date": "2019-08-02 21:46:20", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/claffp/packer_gear_stp_review/", "author": "Oni_Slasher"}, {"title": "How do I know if I'm a \"trender\"? and some thoughts", "text": "Hello   \nI've been worried that I'm a \"transtrender\" after finding this sub, and I'm interested to know what you think  \n\n\nI have been seeing a therapist for a while and according to her assessment last month, I fit into the criteria for gender dysphoria.

I'm 31.\n\nMy whole life I thought nothing could medically be done about my dysphoria. I fell into depressions time and time again. \n\nBefore transitioning I tried everything. \nI tried antidepressants, therapy. Nothing worked to convert my gender identity. \n\nSo ultimately with help of resources on the internet I came to realise I could transition and medically alleviate my long felt dysphoria. \n\nI had laser hair removal and started HRT. Within weeks after starting HRT I felt a clarity I have never felt before in my head. \nI felt peace. A desire to live. \n\nBut I had bottom dysphoria that wouldn't go away on its own. \nIt's not that I hated having a penis. It's that my mind expected a vagina down there. \nI have dysphoria about not being able to experience intimacy as a woman. \n\nMy female part of my gender identity is stronger than my male part. Both are present but I definitely lean more towards woman. \n\nA year ago I came across a post on Reddit in which a person told about their experience with a surgical option that created both a vagina and could retain the phallus. \nWas it atypical? Yes. Was it unethical? No. \n\nWhile I know that many people do not believe in non-binary gender identities fact of the matter is I experience dysphoria. \nMuch of my dysphoria has overlap with what binary MtF individuals experience. \n\nI feel 75-80% that I'm female and 20-25% of me feels male. Bigender with a strong inclination towards female. That's my gender identity. \n\nI went through the gatekeeping mold and was indeed considered gender dysphoric. Never have I misled someone about any part of my identity. I have been 100% honest with psychiatrists about every part of my journey. About my feelings. They still considered me transgender enough to transition. \n\nI have bottom dysphoria. A non-op path is not suitable for me.\n\nSo one year ago I came across a post where a non-binary individual had received vaginoplasty with a skin graft from the scrotum while retaining the phallus. \n\nOne year later I just reached out to a Mexican surgeon who offers me the same surgery. I will pay the 14k$ out of pocket. \n\nI am not keeping my penis for fetishistic reasons. I'm not looking to become an in real life futunari. \nI was not inspired by porn to get this surgery. \nI do not even use my penis during sex with someone. \nSo what is my reason to keep the penis? \nThe fact that there is also this part of me that identifies as male. Like I previously said 75% of me identifies as female, 25% as male. \nThe presence of the phallus would allow my male side to be present. \nThe presence of a neovagina would allow my female side to be present. \n\nI am not intending to go in locker rooms and make people uncomfortable. \nI know that it is atypical. \nI will cover up for the rest of my life while going in locker rooms.\n\nBut I am forever stuck between male and female and both demand their outlet. \nSo removing the phallus to create a neovagina would create its own dysphoria. \nNot doing anything to give me a vagina would make my female side feel incomplete.\n\nI live my every day life as an otherwise normal woman who dresses more on the masculine side. \n\nI have done everything to otherwise fit in. \nHad my documents changed. \nHad laser on the face. \nMy voice trained.\nOn hormones. \n\nI hope that this makes you consider my dysphoria a bit better before you judge. \n\nDemonizing people like myself is not the way to go. We can experience genuine dysphoria that can be solved by medical treatments. \nConversion therapy is not one of those treatments. \n\nOf all people, binary transsexuals should know what dysphoria feels like. If there is a cure to my dysphoria, why do I have to keep suffering when it can be solved?\n\nI'm not hurting anyone in the process, I'm not getting this surgery for fetish reasons, I'm not a pedophile or rapist looking to get in locker rooms and predate. \nI just want to alleviate my dysphoria and go on with life.

I wanted to run some thoughts by you all and see how off-base I am here.\n\nSo this is a very hypothetical question (cause god knows why anybody would actually do this), but say you have a person that does not experience medically-diagnosable dysphoria, but for whatever reason decides that they would like to live life as the other sex.  Maybe they are the archetypical 'trender' who is doing it for purely social reasons.  Maybe they're in an intensely patriarchal society and have economic reasons to do so.  Whatever.  Let's say this person medically and socially transitions rather successfully, and everyone around them is inclined to recognize them as their target sex.  Is this person trans, despite having been internally okay with their birth sex?\n\nFrom what I gather, a lot of you base people's trans status on their dysphoria rather than their transition, and so this person would be \"not really trans\", but materially they are no different than any \"legitimate\" trans person.\n\nOn the other hand we have people who do experience dysphoria but for whatever reason (cost, environment, likelihood of success) choose not to medically or socially transition.

Dysphoria = trans. Yes, everything in me was saying this is a rational thinking sub. Thank God this sub exists. Finally a place that I can get behind.\n\nI think the main reason I was apprehensive about it is that truscum gets dragged on all mainstream trans spaces constantly, and they often strawman the platform to make it seem incoherent.\n\nNot to mention, the term truscum itself was created by these people in order to have a derogatory term for the platform.\n\nI think the term itself is cringey, which shouldn't be a surprise, seeing where it originated from. I don't think appropriating it is a good idea. Why?\n\nWell, for one, it's unpalatable. Who identifies as scum? Anyone not familiar with our platform is going to be like, they seem crazy, just by the name. Names are first impressions, and I think first impressions are lasting impressions. We want a better lasting impression, no?\n\nSecond, it doesn't indicate what our actual platform is about. People unfamiliar with the term truscum will ask their mainstream trans groups what that is, and will be met with a slew of answers that signal to them, \"oh shit, I better not be *that,* or I'll be ostracized.\" This hurts our reach, because most people seeing the term will be apprehensive immediately due to past learning.\n\nThese are the problems I have with the term. I do not, however, have a solution. Maybe we need to discuss one? Or maybe I'm just wrong. I want to hear the honest opinions from this sub.\n\nWhat do you think? Do we need a rebranding at all? If we do, are there any good ideas you have?

I don't wanna be a smart ass - I'm giving all these clothing tips because I want to help others and share my experience because I pass almost everywhere.\n\nAbout me: I'm 5'9 or 175 cm, I have 130 lbs or 59 kg. I have 22% bodyfat. I dress masculine and I'm a binary trans man. If you dress feminine these clothing tips probably won't help you.\n\nOkay so before we get started a couple of tips:\n\n1. Don't buy baggy clothes - they make you look insecure and like you're ashamed of yourself, wear clothes that fit you well but aren't too tight, wear a binder if you can, avoid hoodies or wear hoodies that are slim fit, I usually wear track suit for football because it looks more masculine\n\n2. Dress your age - this is something I've noticed, a lot of trans guys dress like guys who are 30, look around you, dress like most guys who are same age as you and you will pass for sure, follow clothing trends\n\n3. Don't wear clothing that both women and men can wear (I'm talking about neutral clothing, not jeans or something like that)  - button ups are a great example, they are really neutral and you will come off as a nerdy guy or as a butch lesbian, again if that's your style go for it, that's just my opinion\n\n4. Shoes for destroying height dysphoria - Nike Air Max shoes lift you up for like 2 inches, they are like high heels for men haha, I recommend Nike Air 270 and vapormax, avoid shoes with no platform (vans for example)\n\n5. Avoid glasses - I don't like glasses in general so because they make you look nerdy, again this is optional\n\nNow with that out of the way let's start with brands:\n\n- Boxeur Des Rues: The most underrated brand ever, they have really small sizes because they are Italian brand, they have clothing for boxing and believe me when I say that these clothes make you look like a jock, search for t shirts with shoulder patches, they make you look ripped and they really change the way your body looks, if I wear a shirt with shoulder patches I look like I have V shaped body and I feel much more confident, they fit so well, the material is amazing\n\n- Emporio Armani: Really expensive brand but they have amazing t shirts, they have smaller sizes so if you're under 5'9 you'll find something for sure, zip ups are also dope but expensive, really amazing materials, I love their polos, I look really classy wearing this brand\n\n- USPA and Polo Ralph Lauren: Amaziiiing polos, great quality, they have small sizes, polos hide your hips completely because they fit well where your shoulders are and are loose around your waist, I really love polos in general because people automaticly assume that you're a guy because women usually don't wear polos, believe me you'll look classy and they have so many different colors\n\n- Nike: Buy at children section because they have really big sizes, I reccomend football track suits and shorts for the gym, you have to try Nike Tech Fleece - they are really comfortable and you look really maculine, do not buy polos - they are made from shitty material and don't fit well\n\n- Calvin Klein: best boxers ever, so comfortable, they also have cool pyamas, they have big sizes and I don't recommend buying clothes from them (it depends on the shirt), flip flops are also cool\n\nMeh brands:\n\n- Jordan: Reallyyyyy big sizes, their XS is L, if you're bellow 6'0 clothes won't fit you, the children's section also has big sizes I'm M in kids clothing lol, shoes and fanny packs are cool tho, not strechable clothes\n\n- Tommy Hilfiger: Big sizes, clothes fit weirdly, I only recommend jackets and hoodies, flip flops are also really cool\n\n- Puma: Never bought anything from them but their t shirts don't fit me, clothes are way too baggy\n\n\nThnx for reading, I hope you found these tips usefull", "date": "2019-08-09 00:30:39", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cnumpq/clothing_tips_for_trans_guys/", "author": "Randomguy6969696996"}, {"title": "Is this person a trender?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-08-09 00:55:04", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cnuwva/is_this_person_a_trender/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Is this person a trender?", "text": "", "date": "2019-08-09 00:56:53", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cnuxn7/is_this_person_a_trender/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "And I Oop-", "text": "", "date": "2019-08-09 01:20:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cnv7my/and_i_oop/", "author": "whyreyouaskin"}, {"title": "Not a truscum/tucute post.

But this isn't a magic world with a magic button. Transitioning is very much a hard and long process, physically and emotionally. And that makes me not so 100% sure of my identity because I don't want to go through all of that. I don't want to be an outcast to my own family and the whole process of transitioning scares the shit out of me. I told my parents I felt this way years ago but they told me to ignore it and that it's a phase because plenty of tomboys think they're trans and then end up detransitioning.

I do experience dysphoria, but the fact that I'm not clawing at my doctor begging her to give me HRT is a big reason why I'm hesitant.

Some structures in the brains of males and females TEND to differ in size, but it is unclear if these differences are caused by a static/immutable difference between the male and female genome. Since brains are highly malleable, especially over the course of a single lifespan, and are subject to change based on experiential stimuli, these structures could vary based on how young boys and girls are treated.\n\nHere is a summary of studies (download the PDF) that argues the following: *biological determinist arguments that discount the profound impact of epigenetics (experience) are inherently flawed.*\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1607551X10700516?via%3Dihub\n\nThis does not, however, mean gender dysphoria and gender identity are affected. These, too, are scientific phenomena that we only partially understand. Children develop a sense of gender identity at around age 3-4. However, it is a combination of genes, hormones, and experience that can lead a child to draw a conclusion about their gender identity. The several famous cases of feral children likely did not develop a concept of gender identity (due to not being exposed to other humans) that majorly affected their development and likely would have resulted in a nonbinary identification of gender.\n\nGenes and hormones play a role in gender identity, certainly.

I also know that someone online after reading one Reddit post can't diagnose me with anything, that's not what I'm here for.\n\nI first sort of discovered I'm trans around 5 years ago, and I've been living as male (I'm a trans guy) to my friends for the best part of that time (4 ish years). I haven't come out to anyone else though really, as I wasn't in a safe and stable position but fortunately I am now. Coming out to my family in particular terrifies me more than anything as the few people I have left are openly transphobic, I've been putting it off since last October actually (when I was first in a safe place to come out) but more than ever now I'm desperate to start this process properly.\n\nThe biggest problem is, my process for transition is to see a psychiatrist specialised in gender and sexuality issues for one appointment (around an hour, hour and a half), and if they think I'm trans and that HRT will help, they'll refer me to an endocrinologist (again for one appointment). I can't afford therapy, nor has the free counselling I've received in the past for my mental health been particularly helpful - in fact, it exacerbated most of my symptoms. But I'm worried that if I go through this process for transition, I'll be rushed through it too quickly because there isn't a therapy stage and I can't find the money for a therapy stage.\n\nI'm particularly concerned about 3 big things: I'm mentally ill and have undergone trauma (got hit with debilitating depression and OCD mainly), I have PCOS (which messes up your hormones, however there are studies that show trans men have higher rates of PCOS than the general population), and I'm insecure about my weight (I'm not super overweight, I fit a men's UK medium, but it's still a huge source of discomfort for me).\n\n(btw, I'm attracted to women but I don't think I'm trans because I don't want to be gay. Before dysphoria hit me like a brick, I was very comfortable and open about being gay! Also yes since I realised I'm probably trans I went through \\~the ultra feminine phase\\~ that a lot of trans guys go through (in my case, the GNC lesbian phase) for about 4 months to convince myself I was a lesbian because I'd *much* prefer to be a lesbian and a GNC woman than a transgender guy, which I've seen is the opposite for a lot of people who end up detransitioning, but I couldn't get through identifying that way for more than 4 months because of dysphoria.)\n\nLiving as male among my friends makes me feel so much more comfortable than when I'm around people who know me as female, and I genuinely shudder every single time I think about myself as a she, or a woman, or really any female term like that. I've also *never* been into feminine stuff which I know doesn't mean you're trans - but I've never voluntarily worn tights, a skirt, makeup, even face paint, and for ages I didn't even wear a bra because I was trying to ignore what puberty did. When I was super young, I always told people I was a boy and when my brother said I was actually a girl I always ran away and got super upset. For a good 5 years (from before I found out about being transgender) I had a \"fake\" fandom account and said I was a 16 year old boy called Connor (at the time I was probably 11). I've never put my birth name on any social media and can barely say it even when I'm asked because it repulses me so so so much. I've worn clothes from the male department for as long as I can remember. I want literally every change from T, thinning hair and body odour and everything except maybe uterus atrophy because that can kill you. As a result of PCOS I have a tiny moustache and it makes me so happy (I'm intending to buy minoxidil for facial hair actually), and pretty much every woman I've seen in the PCOS sub is uncomfortable with facial hair. I've spent over 30 hours researching stuff like height surgery or height enhancers because I can't stand being 5'4, specifically because the male population is taller on average than 5'4. (I only ever compare my height to men) I cry most nights because even if I get phalloplasty (which I would like), I'll never be able to biologically father a child (specifically in the way of providing sperm). I can't bare to urinate sitting down, at home before I got an STP I genuinely used to use an old plastic cup and pour it into the toilet after I was done. I'm super indecisive but I've wanted/needed to transition medically for half a decade, and that's kinda significant for me.\n\nI know none of these things are an objectively transgender thing, that some women are happy having facial hair and so on. But I wanted to be open on this post because as much as I'd like to take things slow and save for therapy then potentially save for hormones and surgery, I don't think I can wait that long. Dysphoria in the last year especially has been like boiling water - I've been sat in it so long I didn't realise it's about to destroy me.\n\nI know this post has been super insanely ridiculously long, and I'm so so sorry, but if you have read this far:\n\nWould it be irresponsible, dangerous, unhealthy, and/or stupid for me to start the medical transition process soon and be on testosterone most likely by the end of the year, without undergoing therapy first?\n\nCheers for any advice.", "date": "2019-08-10 05:22:48", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/coe07q/cant_afford_therapy_but_want_to_be_responsible/", "author": "lucozade001"}, {"title": "What does \"Legalize Trans*\" even mean??", "text": "Wifey said \"I wish I still had my legalize trans shirt\" and I got brain blasted into circa 2013 when everyone would buy those and wear them for the clout at pride or to the mall.

I had SRS six months ago and now feel more like a Kinsey 2.\n\nLong version: I've only been in relationships with women and, although I've always thought about sex with men, I had never thought about men romantically. I socially transitioned nearly a decade ago and spent four of those years working full-time as an escort. The result is I've slept with several hundred men and only about a dozen or so women. Even when I found the men to be attractive, I never enjoyed the sex. I assumed I had things figured out. When I quit escorting, I decided to be celibate for a while since I had stopped enjoying sex and was overwhelmingly put off by people of either gender that were attracted to a woman with a penis. \n\nI approached SRS as just another thing to correct among the numerous other surgeries I've had, but the outcome for me was a total cliche -- I felt a lightness and joy I didn't really expect. Something else I didn't expect was my sex drive coming back. It's purely psychological since my testosterone went from flagging low for a woman to undetectable. I used to never masturbate and now I do maybe five times a week. And I think about men almost exclusively. My attraction to women doesn't seem to have changed, it's just been surpassed. The major difference now is I don't only think about sex with anonymous men, but about what it'd be like to be romantically involved with them. I feel a tension with certain types of attractive men in public that I didn't before. \n\nI thought this might happen a little bit, but not to the degree it has. I'm quite normative sexually so I figured that with regular female genitals sex with men might have the appeal of convenience. However, I never would have thought that when I start dating again I might start with men.

I didn't realize my position was actually worded similarly to popular TERF and tucute arguments.\u00a0\n\n\nI want to say, I *sincerely* wasn't coming in with this as a baseline to start throwing rhetoric at the sub. I think the possibility of that made people uneasy, and I can totally understand why. From my perspective, I was just trying to defend my convictions (that I had learned in part from mainstream trans spaces research / college), but I was also genuinely curious if I was wrong and wanted to see what the sub thought. In retrospect, I should have just asked the sub what they thought about it rather than put it to a \"me vs you\" debate. My mistake, I accept responsibility for that approach.\n\n\nWording aside, I was definitely wrong about one major thing in particular:\n\n\nDimorphic trends in *brain structures* are actually WAY more prevalent than I thought. It actually makes a lot of sense that they would be, given how sexually dimorphic literally everything else about our bodies is.\n\n\nHOWEVER, I still don't think the etiology is clear on why the brain sex dimorphism exists, which really was my main point anyway. If you want proof, it was written at least four times in italics throughout the thread, including in OP. What's more, much of the research I was provided by my opponents actually stated this *in the literal abstract section,* saying it is clear that there are three factors (genes, hormones, and epigenetics / experience), but it's not clear to what extent each plays a role. I think it is clear genes and hormones provide most of the dimorphic character, however. I think we can all agree on that, but it's not like this still doesn't pose problems for what conclusions we can draw.\n\n\nThis unclear etiology poses some problems for conclusions we can draw about transsexual's brains, like whether HRT is actually causing the changes. Only one article (https://www.nature.com/articles/378068a0) so far claims to have isolated the incident from HRT, but it's behind a paywall so my poor ass can't review it yet. One common problem with many of the articles was that the subjects examined were post-mortem and had probably been steeping their brains in HRT for years before examination. Since hormones are a proven variable in brain dimorphism and the brain is malleable enough to continue changes late in the human lifespan, they need to be isolated as a variable before we can say anything definitive about it.\n\n\nThere were some really interesting fMRI studies that examined living subjects as well as studies on MtF gray matter, but in neither case could HRT be effectively ruled out as a cause for the atypical alignment. This isn't damning, but it definitely demands further research in my opinion.\n\n\nWhat does the sub think about this? Are there studies that rule out HRT as the cause for trans brains being more similar to their identified sex than their birth sex? Even if they are behind a paywall, send them my way, I want to review them when I can.\n\n\nTL,DR: I was wrong about many things but I think my main point about unclear etiology of brain structure dimorphism was never adequately refuted and I would like to see what people in the sub think about that.", "date": "2019-08-11 17:40:10", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cozqag/it_didnt_take_me_a_while_month_and_i_was_wrong/", "author": "parfumbabe"}, {"title": "Dr. Powers is amazing and this presentation is awesome!

But lately I've been reading about it more (and in light of fetishists like Yaniv and Stefonknee) and actually I think it holds up really well. There are two points that clarified this for me: \n\n1. The only truly offensive element is the homophobia. However, I realized that many trans women who are attracted to women would not have been considered straight by Benjamin or Kinsey before transitioning. The reason being that they found it difficult to engage in heterosexual intercourse. The normalizing of straight sex outside of intercourse is a fairly recent development in line with a general relaxation of gender roles. Personally, before I had SRS I couldn't orgasm from topping someone and although I slept with more women than men before transitioning it mostly wasn't intercourse. In Benjamin's day this would have been viewed as obviously pathological, making me either a transsexual or a fetishist who had displaced my libido from my genitals.\n2. The other criterion that turned me off when I first learned about the Benjamin Scale was desire for bottom surgery. However, I didn't realize that this was only assessed after the patient had both fully socially transitioned and been on HRT. I don't think I've met a trans woman who hadn't made up her mind about SRS by that point, other than those struggling with situational issues (generally either a romantic relationship, lacking resources, or thinking better techniques will come along). This division is generally in line with that in the first point and it seems like the largest and only predictor of detransition. The only person I'm aware of who detransitioned after SRS was Charles Kane, who's famous for exactly that reason.\n\nAlso, the thing people tend to gloss over is that Benjamin really cared about trans women. He went so far as to consider it an intersex condition despite no biological evidence of such. Now we see him as a gatekeeper, but he was actually the opposite in his day -- helping patients get around crossdressing laws and convincing surgeons to operate on them at all. \n\nThis is in stark contrast to Blanchard, who's often considered a similar figure and seems to have renewed popularity among truscum that I don't at all think is deserved. Criticism of Blanchard mainly comes from trans women who he'd consider AGP types so it's easy to miss the fact that he doesn't respect HSTS any more. One of the key features of HSTS is they don't desire bottom surgery. They're also generally non-white, low IQ, and low class. I can't believe that no one ever pointed out to me how racist his typology is. Benjamin believed in transsexualism so much he considered it an intersex condition whereas Blanchard believes in it so little it has to be a perversion one way or the other.\n\nThis is all to say I think we should bring back the Benjamin SOS Scale. It's still the best way to understand a broad range of AMAB people who consider themselves trans including creepy fetishists, non-binary people, and trans women.", "date": "2019-08-16 05:30:51", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cr1y1j/lets_bring_back_the_benjamin_scale/", "author": "sg2k19"}, {"title": "After nearly 6 years, I may be FINALLY starting T", "text": "TLDR; I haven't been able to start T yet- despite being nearly 20- thanks to shit physical health. I'm doing way better now, and am finally able to talk to my doctor about starting T!\n\n\n\nSo, I'm a 19 year old trans guy (turning 20 next month). \nI've felt bad about my body (though for a long time I thought I was just insecure) for nearly 12 years; I've known I wasn't a girl for 8; I was officially diagnosed with gender dysphoria 6 years ago, with the diagnosis staying consistent over the years and among multiple mental health professionals.\n\nDespite being diagnosed with dysphoria at the age of 14, my parents didn't want to let me do anything to transition outside of going by a different name and dressing and presenting myself as masculine until I was an adult and could be fully certain of it. When I turned 18, I figured I would finally be able to start transitioning. \nHowever, my body fucking hates me. \nBasically, you name a system in my body, and there's most likely something wrong with it. (GI issues? Chronic but not anything more than inconvenient and annoying. Lungs? Asthma. Muscles? Atrophy from years of an eating disorder. Reproductive system? Doesn't know how to function. Head? Chronic migraines AND my brain doesn't know how to make the happy-feel-good-drugs. Nervous system? Damaged by the meds I have to take to regulate the chemicals in my brain, and I was recently diagnosed with drug-induced parkinsonism.)\nBecause of this, I've been unable to start hormones, as there were other issues that needed fixing. \n\nHowever, there have been huge improvements in my physical health! I've started going to the gym, which has helped with a lot. I've learned what does and doesn't make me sick, and my meds are figured out so I'm on the least amount possible. I also started a new monthly shot for migraines, which has brought the number I have monthly down from 20+ to 1-5. \nSo now that I'm in good health, I can finally, FINALLY, after all this time, ask my doctor about starting T.\n\nI have already talked with my psychiatrist about it; she let me know she's never prescribed hormones before so she wouldn't be comfortable doing so, but she is more than happy to sign off saying it is in the best interest of my mental health for me to transition. I also talked with my OBGYN about it, and while she isn't comfortable dealing with testosterone herself since it's not her area of study, she said I should definitely do it if it will help elevate my dysphoria. \n\nSo, I'm going to be going back to my regular doctor (technically a nursing practioner) who will hopefully be able to prescribe me T (while researching, I've seen that nursing practioners commonly prescribe hormones for cis people having different issues, so she should be able to prescribe them to me if a psychiatrist approves of it). If she is unable to or is uncomfortable doing so, my only other choice is Planned Parenthood (which I support as a healthcare provider but at least where I live, they only have buildings in dangerous areas so I'd prefer not to go to them if possible).\n\nI am so fucking excited though. My voice gives me such bad dysphoria that I don't even speak in public. I have a binder and while that helps, I try to limit how much I wear it for health and safety reasons. I'm short, but I'm okay with that, and going to the gym has been helping me feel more like the man I am. But I can't wait to start T, even if I'm not at the young age where it'll be a simple transition. I know there can be negative side effects, but I am okay with that, anything is better than the constant dysphoria. \n\nI'm finally taking steps. It's not as big of a step as ay top surgery or anything, but compared to the only other steps I've been able to take so far (socially transitioning, presenting masculine) it is insane to think it's just within my grasp, and I couldn't be happier.", "date": "2019-08-16 08:30:58", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/cr3iif/after_nearly_6_years_i_may_be_finally_starting_t/", "author": "imhyperer"}, {"title": "I finnally got a binder.", "text": "A few days ago my friend (God bless her she's super supportive) got me a binder and it works pretty well.

Non-binary, genderfluid, agender, etc. My dysphoria never really went away, but the nonsensical \"gender identity\" politics of the mainstream trans community, with their apparent conflation of gender expression and gender dysphoria, really messed me up. Like seeing a bunch of guys talk about liking dresses so they must be trans! But what about a transsexual whose expression is more non-conforming? If anyone can be trans, then how are we defining it?\n\nAnd there again, I try to fall back into that cycle of attempting to comprehend them. But I can't. Their beliefs fundamentally have no basis in reality. They can't be critically and logically understood. Gender dysphoria and gender non-conformance are not the same thing. You can be cis and conform or not. And you can be trans and conform or not. And acting like everyone who doesn't conform is trans takes away from the problems that we *actually* face, not the problems that another group faces.\n\nMy gender dysphoria is not a social phenomena. It isn't a personal choice. It's not a joke or a game or a trend. It's not an illness like cancer, or something to be ashamed of. It's a condition to be treated with respect (and/or therapy, hormones, surgery). Being a woman doesn't \"sound like fun.\" Taking drugs isn't \"worth trying.\" Transitioning socially and legally isn't something I really look forward to. But they're realities of my life. And as hard as my life may be sometimes, I accept that. I'd rather be true transsexual scum than a political trend-chaser. Because that's what I am.

There was once a time, before non-binary people were widely recognized and the trend hadn\u2019t caught on yet, when a feminine man could dress femininely and that was just considered their style. We had clear lines of where personality started and where personality became gender identity. Now, there are no lines.\n\nThe result is that gender, as a term, has been bastardized to mean any form of personality expression. This goes as far as to include lesbians who use he/him pronouns. That\u2019s kind of the point of pronouns - to depersonalize the individual and make it -easier- to refer to a certain person in the abstract. If your sexual orientation is lesbian, but you dress masculinely, that is a choice of style preference not an expression of gender, and as such calling oneself transgender is inappropriate.\n\nTucute doctrine attempts to throw out gender roles in favor of a free-expression society, but in actuality strengthens them by effectively assigning roles and traits to each of their discovered genders (which are now more numerous than Pok\u00e9mon). It conflates personality with legitimate expression of gender. I am not a trans woman because I want to look feminine. I don\u2019t admire the feminine form as some kind of fetish. I transitioned because I was (a) REALLY BAD at being a guy; (b) had spent my entire life wishing I was female, dating back to when I was 4 or 5 years old; (c) had crippling dysphoria which made it hard to look at myself in the mirror; (d) strongly desired to BE female - with everything from personality to physicality to biology - everything about my maleness bothered me.\n\nIf you are a lesbian and you idealize the male form - you are allowed to just be a cis lesbian who dresses masculinely. Just like if you are a gay man who idealizes the feminine form, you can dress and act femininely. Both of these are perfectly okay and, in fact, welcomed.\n\nIf you identify with a feminine personality, but not the rest of being female (read: you decide willingly to keep your boy parts or grow a beard or willingly not take HRT), you don\u2019t need to, and in fact probably shouldn\u2019t, transition for that sole reason because you: (a) use healthcare resources (therapy, hormones, surgery wait lists) which are needed by people suffering from actual, crippling dysphoria; (b) conflate gender with personality, and; (c) needlessly confuse those outside the LGBT community with intentionally vague definitions and expressions which modern society cannot possibly keep up with.\n\nIf the healthcare system made any sense, it would treat those with only gender euphoria as \u201celective\u201d medical necessity while treating those with crippling medical dysphoria as \u201cmedically necessary\u201d.\n\nThank you for coming to my ted talk on why gender euphoria absent dysphoria is dangerous as a diagnostic tool.", "date": "2019-08-17 04:48:50", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/crhqev/personalitystyle_vs_gendersex/", "author": "juicykitten22"}, {"title": "Is Tucute euphoria really mislabeled fixing of dysphoria?", "text": "For context my country has the highest domestic violence rates in the OECD and Youth Suicide rates.

They know their life sucked, their brain sucked and now they're normal functional members of society which comparatively feels like being wonderful or 'euphoric' if you were to be melodramatic. \n\nI'm starting to think Euphoria is just stubborn sods refusing to admit their life was shit, instead they think feeling like shit is the base line everyone is like and feeling what we regard as normal [after transitioning] is therefor 'euphoria'.\n\nSo instead of admitting they're dysphoric they think everyone is normally a miserable sod.

So I questioned my stance for a while there and the more I questioned the more I saw of how shitty and toxic the truscum community was. Being involved had made me into such a judgemental and hateful person and I\u2019m so embarrassed of that even now. The truscum I was surrounded by were just as bad and I realized how horrible it was to be a questioning trans person involved in that type of toxicity. TERF rhetoric seemed to be repeated in a lot of places and that was too uncomfortable.\n\nSo I left and put myself in more tucute circles and was instantly so much happier. Nobody was putting anyone down or questioning whether they were trans enough or calling anyone a trender. It was just a nice place. I became more understanding. I realized I was non-binary after I had been so opposed to the idea of that existing. Most truscum I knew were non-binary skeptics and that had left me skeptical too. Anyways, I ended up joining a discord server that was a place for truscum and tucutes to come together for peaceful discourse and I met a lot of other people there who were similar to me. I talked to a few non-dysphorics and they seemed just as trans as I was and others were. I came to find that most of the trenders I was seeing were actually truscum.

Seeing Storm Ryan\u2019s recent video on this as well seemed to show that other people have noticed that too.\n\nBeing former truscum to me has been almost as damaging as being a former Catholic has been. I\u2019ve been left with a lot of self-doubt and this silly mindset that makes me question my own legitimacy every time I\u2019m not feeling dysphoric. \n\nI\u2019m not saying all truscum are bad. A lot of my friends are truscum and so is my current partner. But the community as a whole is what I\u2019ve found to be so toxic.\n\nI\u2019m currently trying to be open to the truscum beliefs again. I don\u2019t think at its heart it was meant to be this bad so I\u2019m trying to see the other side/perspective instead of holding this negative stereotype in my head. I just want to be better at understanding.\n\nIf anyone could just discuss it with me or even leave credible sources I\u2019d be really happy. Thanks in advance! :)\n\nEDIT: Everyone is assuming I\u2019m saying all truscum are these horribly toxic people so please let me clarify. I don\u2019t believe that in the slightest. I think that collectively the group is somewhat toxic to an extent, but most truscum individuals are incredibly nice people that I\u2019ve never had an issue with. What I meant in all this is that being a part of the general community that does have an extreme side (as all communities do) that I ended up getting exposed to sucked and was pretty horrible. It left me with as I mentioned, self-doubt and this negative stereotype that I\u2019m trying to kick by coming here.\n\nI\u2019m in no way saying each and every one of you is a horrible and evil person that I absolutely despise.

I want to stop caring about all of these other trans people out there, whether they be truly trans or faking it, I just want to stay more away from the trans agenda and community and let people do what makes them happy and do what they want. But my own feelings towards gender and being transgender still remain of course. Now and then I only believe in 2 genders, but still I believe that some non-binary people can exist. When it comes to pronouns I find myself less likely and willing to use they/them pronouns for people, I'd rather have whoever it is just choosing which binary pronouns make them feel better objectively. I think that all of these people who identify with anything more than transman/transwoman are just doing it for fun or trying to feel cool or special all the while tarnishing what it actually means to be trans and to struggle. In my own transition, I went through a nonbinary phase and I don't regret it because I was just finding myself, and back then I still had dysphoria and it made me uncomfortable to be perceived as a female and as time passed and understood myself more and dysphoria got worse and I realized that I was a transmale.  \nI want be this person that's chill and calm and doesnt care what people do with their lives as long as theyre not hurting anyone and as long as their happy, but being a transguy and seeing so many people ID themselves as demi-boy or Nonbi egg or genderfluid or anything that's so completely unnecessary, makes me sick. Not to mention the absurd \"PREFERRED\" pronouns that don't make any sense at all. Now all of the normal people who befriend these people will start to think that that is what being trans is. A gag where no one has to put any effort in and can call their gender anything under the sun or even say that on a day-to-day bases, their gender can fucking change. These people make it more and more difficult for real, normal transgender and transexual people to be seen and to have the stronger voices in the community. I'm friends with a \"nonbinary\" person who puts in no effort to how he looks or how he acts and until he actively does so, I will not respect his identity as a \"TRANS\" person.

In January, I took the first step in my physical transition - I started laser hair removal, and a couple of months later I finally started hormones. I've also started wearing female clothes. \n\nAll of this has really helped with passing, and I feel much less dysphoric when I'm out in public or when I'm hanging out with my friends who see me as female. I still get really bad bouts of dysphoria occasionally but it's nowhere near as bad as it used to be. The only thing that really bothers me is having to get ID'd since I haven't changed my name yet, although I'm working on that, and being around my family who I'm not out to.\n\n... And that's exactly my problem. Transitioning has only alleviated my dysphoria. It hasn't made me a happier person because I have unrelated mental health issues that I thought were caused by the dysphoria. But apparently they're not. Which is shit, because you're supposed to be happy after you transition. I can barely enjoy any of the changes I've been getting. I've suffered from really bad anxiety for 2 years, having panic attacks regurarly (sometimes multiple times a day), but it all seemed to subside when I got on hrt. \n\nUnfortunately, that was only the case for about 2 to 3 months, and then the excitement of starting my medical transition just wore off. About 4 months in I started having panic attacks almost every single day and my mental health has been rapidly deteriorating to the point where I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to function and I'm gonna go off the deep end... \n\nI've been ignoring my anxiety for a long time and I've refused to see a therapist until about a month ago.

I\u2019m a third-year law school student currently taking a research seminar on the topic of sexual harassment in the modern era, and the movements surrounding it. Part of the requirement for the seminar, which is itself a graduation requirement, is to write a fully developed legal research paper on a related topic of our choosing. I already think I know what I want to cover, and I wanted to ask for input. \n\nSince so much has been buzzing lately about the Yanivs and Stefonknees of the world, I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking about what the trans movement has turned into now that obvious predators are being given a free pass to run roughshod over the rights of vulnerable people and play the \"trans card\" to deflect any criticism. As I\u2019m sure many of you would agree, this seems to be directly linked to the recent shift in rhetoric away from a medical perspective, which has enabled almost anyone to self-ID as trans and access all the protections and benefits that trans status confers while experiencing virtually none of the detriments. \n\nWhy does our society allow a self-proclaimed \u201ctrans woman\u201d to abuse our medical condition and the justice system as a weapon to attack others and destroy their lives? The Yaniv ball-waxing saga in particular stands out as an example of an individual using their trans status to sexually harass women into touching their genitals *by force of law*. I find this deeply disturbing, and I sincerely hope that the rest of the sane world does as well.\n\nIn light of all of this, I feel like my research topic is kind of already picked for me haha. I specifically want to examine the ways in which trans status can be used as a means to facilitate sexual harassment and assault or to justify it post hoc. I also want to try to answer the question of how we can frame the law in such a way as to protect the 99% of innocent transsexuals who simply want to live their lives in peace, while simultaneously preventing monsters like JY &amp; S from hurting people, and hurting the rest of us in the process. And since the problem is so deeply connected to fetishism and dysphoria (or lack thereof), I feel this community would possibly be interested in the subject. My question for y\u2019all is this: do you have any suggestions for specific areas or situations you\u2019d be interested in looking into with regards to the trans movement and sexual harassment/violence? Any studies, articles, or random happenings I should be aware of? And are there any particular questions you feel are important to the cause of transmedicalism and to the broader cause of protecting our communities from predators?

But on the other, people who claim to care about our safety and well-being are also telling me I deserve to get misgendered for the simple fact of I haven't been able to transition yet, despite several factors:\n1) I live in rural Ohio and have no liscense. I wasn't considered safe to drive until only a few months ago, as I was in a bad mental state for several years and it was a genuine fear of my therapist, parents, and others that if I had access to a motor vehicle I would try to off myself in a crash. Where I live, the nearest building outside of houses to my home is the high school, which is still a 45 minute walk. I have to go to a completely different town for any and all medical care, and the Planned Parenthood's where I live are in heavily dangerous areas where there have been shootings and stabbings in broad daylight, so not somewhere I am safe going. I'm working on getting my liscense so I can drive to other areas, but I failed my driver's test nearly 2 weeks ago and have to complete driver's school and driving with an instructor before I can test again; for the only driving school in my county, it's a 2-3 week wait. I'm on the wait list, but there's nothing more I can do about it for the time being. \n2) I have been working for months with my doctor's to be put on T. I got approval from my psychiatrist that she will sign off on it as she has diagnosed me (along with several other medical professionals over the past 6 years) with dysphoria and that it is important for my mental health that I transition. She can't prescribe me hormones however, as that's not her area of expertise. I talked to my OBGYN and the same thing, she can't prescribe it despite it being in my best interest. I am hopefully going back to my regular doctor (a nursing practioner) and will finally be able to ask her about it; we've been spending the past several years addressing more eminent issues to my health, such as my lungs not working, daily migraines that left me unable to function, etc. We finally got everything along those lines figured out to where I can finally ask. \n3) while my parents are accepting to the point of understanding I'm gonna transition and not kicking me out, they won't help out financially, which is fair enough. I am already on a bunch of meds (several for GI issues, several for mental health issues, migraine medication, and meds to help with my parkinsons) so it's a bit of a financial strain to afford yet another prescription. I can't get a job due to the liscense/rural area issue, but I have started doing art commissions as a way to start saving and so far have made a few hundred dollars. \n\nI'm sick of people telling me I'm not REALLY trans despite having been consistently diagnosed with dysphoria by multiple mental health professionals over the past 6 years, despite trying my hardest to pass even though medically there is nothing I can currently do. \n\nWith cis people, guys don't see me as a guy, but girls don't see me as one either. I'm not comfortable hanging out around girls, it makes me extremely dysphoric to be treated like another girl to them, but guys treat me like a girl as well. I'm told off by the tucutes for wanting to pass, but when I come here, I'm told off by transmeds for not having transitioned already despite having every intention and desire to and actively working to the best of my ability to do so with a shit situation..\n\nI'm sick of not belonging amount anyone, so fuck it, why even try?

When I was about 15 I started noticing that I was really disassociated, and thought my face was really horrible even though people would come up to me and say I was attractive. I thought it was just my acne, but my acne cleared up and the feeling of disgust presisted. I then realized my naked body was really gross. I became exposed to trans stuff around that time and thought about it quite a bit, and a formed a more femmine image of myself in my head. I was really comfortable with this image. I tested around with dresses and stuff and I felt kinda gross with my shoulders and stuff. I'm now almost 18 and I had my id pic for school and it was super masculine. This made me feel way more depressed then I expected. It's like this image I had of myself being a femmine boy has been shattered and now I can only see my masculine features. My face looks gross, my shoulders are gross, my naked body is gross, my hands are gross, and my body hair is gross. I had an experience where I felt like I was coming out of my disassociation and it was terrifying. Everything in my life felt wrong, and I hated my body completely. \n\nI can still live my cis self but I hate the idea of growing up. I hate the idea of coming out. I sometimes think transitioning sounds nice, but the process seems horriying to me. I feel like I'm lying to myself to feel better about my depression. Hormones terrify me, and I have no idea what I would look like as a woman. Im not sure if I have dysphoria but if I do it's manageable. I can look and clean my dick as long as I don't see the rest of my body, but it's really hard to look in the mirror. \n\nI'm sorry if this doesn't make much sense, I'm just really sad and confused, and don't want the bullshit \"everyones valid uwu dick girl\". I enjoy wearing leggings a lot and anything that takes focus away from my shoulders, but I really don't like super femmine stuff. When I look at a girl I get super envious and then afterwards feel like a parasite.\n\nI can live with my body and do swimming and stuff as long as i dont think about my body, which is easy with my disassociation.

I agree someone can be on the binary but be feminine or masculine Ex. Femme boy or masculine woman. But to say you do not identify as either or both seems fishy. To be honest I think most people who feel that way are just feminene men or masculine women who are convinced just because they do not fit within the normal means they are both genders.\n\nEdit: Im so glad most of everyone here agrees with me.

I'm pretty sure early on in my transition I embraced it because there was no hope in my country for anything regardless, legal hrt was (still is) banned, changing documents was such a ridiculously complicated process that it was virtually impossible, and things like anti-discrimination rights and policies were a distant dream at best. \nBut in recent years, things started changing as lgbt groups started making progress in terms of rights for everyone in lgbt. But here's something that hit me recently, the initial progress with trans acceptance in the west came as a result of people arguing the point of it being a medical issue, and seemingly only after progress has been made, all of a sudden a whole bunch of people appeared for whom it wasn't a medical issue at all but rather an issue of dying their hair blue and forcing people to call them zir/zer or whatever.\nNow while local lgbt activism has made some progress, there is still a loooong way to go to anywhere near the levels of acceptance in the west and similar laws being past (like I said, it's still impossible to get hrt here legally for example). But now it seems that when it comes to trans rights, local people who are coming into contact with anything trans related for the first time are seeing the \"I am dragongender, call me zer and wax my balls bigot uwu\" people, and what's even worse, some local activists are embracing it. For example, n a few weeks there's a meeting scheduled in the local lgbt organisation for \"transgender people\", in which they included anyone who identifies as anything, nb people and drag queens... Why? None of those people have anything to do with being trans. And why are theater performers getting a say in what's important for actual trans people?...\nPeople here will never accept this, in fact if anything, if this goes more mainstream, this will likely lead to rights being rolled back even further. My country is not the exception in this, the majority of countries in the world are like or worse than my country for trans people, but because of the \"million genders\" crowd running around in their liberal bubbles who have completely co-oped actual trans peoples existences, they are putting a ton of people all over the world in situations where they are at risk of forever being third class citizens with no right, access to healthcare or anything.\nIt's actually amazing to me how people like that Yaniv guy even exist in the west. The trans community here kind of knows each other through closed groups and stuff where we share important information, and there are close to 0 people in my whole country who identify anything other than binary mtf or ftm. Probably because the social cost of doing something like that here would be comparable to social suicide. For a long time the cost for being an actual trans person was very similar, but despite that, there were always trans people, and it's not a walk in the park now either, and despite that there are dozens upon dozens of trans people living their lives and struggling.

It could have messed up my life and body and is currently destroying a friend's life.\n\nI've been thinking about writing this post for a long time, but I never knew where to post it until I found this subreddit. Please let me know if this is not the right subreddit for this kind of post. As a disclaimer, I do not want any TERFs or alt-righters using this post to further their hateful agendas. Trans rights are human rights, but not everyone is trans.\n\nJust for some context, I am a bi man in my early 20s. When I was 18, I went through a period of questioning my gender identity. What should have been a few weeks of healthy questioning and reflection was derailed by the mainstream Reddit trans community, especially r/Egg_Irl and similar subreddits. Here is the story of what happened to me and the conclusions I drew from it.\n\n___\n\nOne day when I was 18, I browsing through r/AskReddit in an attempt to avoid my responsibilities. Eventually, I reached a thread entitled \"Guys who make female characters in games, why?\" Most of the comments in the thread were generic and boring, but there was one chain that stuck with me:\n\n&gt; Because I secretly want to be a girl, and role-playing as a girl in video games is a form of escapism.\n\n&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, I probably play female characters for the same reason I have female clothes and makeup in my dresser and wear women's underwear instead of men's. I don't have dysphoria, so don't think it would be worth transitioning, but give me a safe place like a video game or a queer bar and it's on.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I feel similarly. I'm not trans, but I do sometimes wish I was a girl. Better yet, I wish I had a switch so I could change between male and female at will.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; You sound a lot like I did when I was in the closet, friendo.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Important newsflash: almost all cisgender men don't really want to be women at all\n\nAs someone who often plays as female characters in video games (probably around 1/3 of the time), this got me curious. Was it possible that I too was trans and experiencing escapism? I didn't think of myself as female in any way. However, because I had something related to gender expression in common with a trans woman, I wanted to look into the question of whether I was trans. Unfortunately, the first place I was directed to was r/Egg_Irl. It was here that I recieved some of the worst advice of my life.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the bingo cards. I didn't realize it, but some of them are designed in a way to be as relatable as possible. [This one](https://cadence.moe/egg/card/13) even includes squares such as \"I would never want to wear a wig\", \"Manga girls are so cute!\", and \"I have female role models\". Being an impressionable teenager with LGBT tendencies (I didn't realize I was bi yet), I took these as fact and started getting concerned, and began looking through r/Egg_Irl and r/AskTransgender more frantically. Each time I read something such as \"If you are questioning your gender identity, you are probably trans\" and \"Hoodies are egg culture\",  my anxiety only increased. Only a few hours after I read the r/AskReddit thread, I made a throwaway account to try to find out what was happening. My first post on r/MTF or r/AskTransgender was something like this (I've since deleted the account and can't access the actual post):\n\n&gt; I'm 18 AMAB and about to go to college. I've been having some serious doubts about my gender identity? I've always been more effiminate than other guys around me and I don't really fit in with them. In fact, most of my friends are girls. I think I would press the button if it wasn't permanent. What can I do to figure out whether I am trans or not?\n\nIn response, I got more of the same information I had already seen:\n\n&gt; If you are questioning this much, you are probably trans\n\n&gt; You remind me of me when I was an egg. Even though you are the only one that can decide if you are trans, I think that you are.\n\n&gt; Read these links (large number of links from r/AskTransgender) and you can tell. Remember to doubt everything, including your doubts.\n\n&gt; You could try starting hormones and see if they help you.\n\nWell, fuck. That was enough to convince me. After all, the people that responded were probably experts on gender identity. Even though I showed no signs of dysphoria, I could still be trans, right? With \"YOU DO NOT NEED DYSPHORIA TO BE TRANS\" posted everywhere, I was sure there were lots of actual trans people that had gone through what I had. Under this train of thought, I made a second post on r/MTF:\n\n&gt; I think I am trans. What do I do now?\n\nKeep in mind that this was the day after I saw the r/AskReddit thread. In less than 24 hours, the egg culture of Reddit (and anxiety of starting college soon) had convinced me that I was an extremely repressed trans woman, that I should taking estradiol to resolve my questioning, and that I should doubt my doubts. The responses to this worsened my already poor and anxiety driven decision making:\n\n&gt; Begin HRT immediately so you can get large hips\n\n&gt; Come out to a close friend.\n\n&gt; Buy some female clothes so that you can feel like yourself.\n\n&gt; Talk to a gender therapist so you don't make any rash decisions (by far the best piece of advice I had received. If only I had listened.)\n\nAnd that's how I ended up \"coming out\" as trans #TWO #DAYS after beginning questioning. I asked one of my best friends to go on a hike with me, and I told her I was trans towards the end of it. As the president of the high school's GSA before we graduated, I knew that she would be non judgmental. After a long (several hours) explanation of my \"reasoning\" and \"repression\", I told her. Her response was appropriate for what someone had told her: \"What pronouns and name do you prefer?\" I said that I didn't know yet. After all, referring to myself using female pronouns made me deeply uncomfortable for some reason I couldn't describe. When I got home, I felt like shit. My emotional baggage had only gotten heavier. Wasn't coming out supposed to make me feel validated? Like myself? \"Must be repression and self hatred,\" I thought. I read through the DSM section on gender dysphoria. Even though I still didn't fit any of the categories (ESPECIALLY NOT \"FOR 6 MONTHS\"), it's still possible to be trans without dysphoria, right? At this point, I wanted to be trans much more than I wanted to be a girl. This seemed more and more inevitable as my decisions got worse. I felt trapped under the label of trans woman. I was already out, so how much worse could it get?\n\nA few days later, I went to college (after nearly \"coming out\" to my mom; I made a few good decisions). At the beginning, my mind wasn't focused on making new friends or doing well in classes, it was focused on the idea of being trans. I began to fantasize about how my life would be once I got hormones and was out to everyone. This included things such as \"Wow. (Male name) is so great for getting into this college despite being trans.\" Many people, my current self included, would have called me a \"bigot\" if they knew what I was thinking about. It didn't matter to me that these fantasies included me having a male body, and name, the female picture of myself would come soon enough, right?\n\nThroughout the next few weeks, I began experimenting with my gender identity, or what you should do FIRST if you are questioning your gender. Though the clothes themselves were comfortable (the fabric is much softer than my clothes), appearing female made me uncomfortable. Putting socks in my shirt nearly gave me a panic attack. A thought that kept passing through my mind was \"what if I become an old woman?\" I couldn't think of anything worse. One thing I did like was wearing women's underwear and not tucking. I liked seeing the bulge. Perhaps I could just be non-op, I thought. It did seem kind of strange that the only part I liked about this was through expressing my masculinity.\n\nEach way I experimented with a female gender identity felt more wrong. Wearing makeup, a wig, and painting my fingernails just made me more depressed. This wasn't the way Reddit said I would feel. Presenting as female was supposed to help me feel happier and more like myself. Maybe hormones would make me feel better. I started looking for do it yourself hormones online (Note: DO NOT DO THIS WITHOUT TALKING TO A DOCTOR AND PSYCHOLOGIST). For a few days, my thoughts were filled with thought about what would happen if I started female HRT. Around this point, the friend that I had come out to texted me with something important to say.\n\n&gt; Hi _malename_ (I still hadn't chosen or even thought about a female one), what you said to me really reached me. It made me realize that I had been repressing too. I want to be able to wear a suit and (includes personal details). I want to tell you that I now identify as nonbinary and my pronouns are she/her.\"\n\nAfter reading this, everything clicked for me. I had fucked up so badly that not only was I ruining my own life, I was also about to ruin my best friend's life. The uncomfortable feeling I had felt while thinking of myself as female was the real dysphoria. No wonder I couldn't imagine myself as a woman and be happy. I donated all of my female clothes, I deleted my Reddit account, and I explained my mistake to my friend. As a result, we got into a bad fight. She accused me of not respecting non binary identities and lying to myself. I accused her of being an idiot who has fallen victim to a trick. I then said some things I regret and now I haven't talked to her since then. Though I was able to preserve my actual gender identity, I passed on a false one to someone I really cared about. I constantly see her post on Instagram that she has no friends because of bigotry and her life is a nonstop oppression conga line. She looks and presents exactly the same as when we were in high school, but seems much sadder than before. I can't help but blame myself for what has happened to her and the current status of her life.\n\nEven now, I often think about what would have happened if I obtained hormones. Would I be living as a woman now? Would I have found out either way? Would I have stayed in college? These are questions no one can answer, but thankfully they will always be hypothetical. Though college did get off to a rocky start, everything got better for me when I fully accepted myself as male. In an effort to end a very, very long post, here are some of the lessons I've learned from my experience:\n\n**You need dysphoria to be trans.** If you don't have dysphoria, if you don't want to be another gender, then why the hell would you identify as trans? Isn't that the point of being trans?\n\n**Men can express femininity without being trans.** Women can also express masculinity without being trans. It is ok for me to like cute things and to like playing as [cute characters](https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/f/f2/Black_2_White_2_Rosa.png) in video games. If anyone asks you why, it is none of their business. Previous girlfriends and boyfriends have liked it when I wear pink, and that's all that matters to me.\n\n**Telling EVERYONE that they are trans is extremely harmful to the trans community.** It makes non trans people use up trans resources. It makes alt-righters and TERFs think that legitimate trans people are making everything up. It pushes away potential allies who are constantly spammed with r/Egg_Irl.

Omg, I fucking hate thieves. They're always fucking with your stuff.  That career criminal I mentioned died and I don't mean to he hateful but maybe if someone is preying on others and there's no sign of a possibility of change maybe its better for society if they're not going to be kept in line for them to be dead.  At which point I needed to contextualize exactly what a thief is because I myself have stolen a thing except for under pressure from someone else or except for I didn't really fully understand the implication and except it was less times than you can count on your hand and I learned from it, didn't make a habit or career out of it.  This reminded me of the psychology about hate I read and I realized that this hatred of thieves where I'm making excuses for a dude to kill a dude over possessions and breaking social taboos probably has something to do with my own issues about the aforementioned times that I was quibbling over that I decided didn't count and made me not a thief and good compared to the bad thieves who intentionally knowingly repeatedly hurt others and refuse to stop.  For example, if I said the thief clock starts as age of majority I could paint myself as completely innocent compared to the horrible monster stealing something at 50.  But I'm the one drawing that line and basically its function is distancing myself from something about myself I'm uncomfortable with and projecting it onto others according to psychology.com.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with trans issues?  Well i feel like I've been looking dumb on a bunch of trans (and terf) related subs going around  saying \"illogical conclusion!

He's famously known for going after transtrenders and SJW's and pretty much going off on them about how their wrong and such and how their hurting the trans community. He's a hardcore truscum (as am I) but I feel with some people he goes too harsh after. If you ever scene his videos, people like Rin and Lars are just crazy attention seeking weirdos who hide behind the trans community in hopes of oppression points. Bex is an SJW that acts like their the \"leader\" or \"voice\" of the trans community when all they did was change their name and pronouns. (Not saying you need to medically transtion to be trans but Bex is clearly not one of us, I mean they posted a pic of them on IG with their tits exposed.) But people like Brennen I feel he went too hard after. Brennen seemed confused, not dangerous or ridiculous. And quite honestly, Kalvin needs to apologize. But thats my opinion. Anyway, I agree with 99% of Kalvins views but again, theres certain people I feel he was harsh to that didnt deserve it.  In my opinion, I think Kalvins dysphoria is so bad to the point were he hates himself and hes in constant misery, and as we all know, misery loves company. Yes, we all have dysphoria Kalvin.

I thought I would share my experience with a friend of mine.  I've shared this story a few times in comments, but never went into great detail about what happened.\n\nI met my circle of friends pretty late in life.  They were all pretty accepting of me when I eventually opened up to them about my gender identity.  One friend in particular, Patrick, introduced us all to one of his coworkers and shortly after, that coworker began her transition.  Of course in her case this had been a long progress and years of consideration and therapy...it just so happened we met her right before she was to start her transitioning.  For Patrick, he then became very curious about the process and what it is being trans.\n\nPatrick knew me obviously (I'm FTM) and now was seeing someone else (MTF) at the start of transitioning.  Patrick asked me a few questions, occasionally talked about what he was seeing with his coworker, and began doing his own research on \"what it means to be trans.\"\n\nI didn't think much about it at the time.\n\nBut what was maybe a month after learning that his coworker is trans, Patrick came out as trans to all of us.  It was surprising to us all especially for those who had known him since high school.  Patrick had always seemed pretty comfortable about his body, even so far as bragging about his dick size and that sort of thing.  So for us it was kind of like, \"Where is this coming from?\" and \"What made you come to this realization?\"\n\nHe was pretty vague about it and said he had just been doing a lot of research on being trans.  Then he said he realized he was a trans woman because he doesn't like sports, isn't anything like his dad, and is a bit awkward.  The idea of being trans made all these personality \"quirks\" make sense to him.  He went on about how he really struggled with trying to follow his dad's image and meet his dad's expectations and so \"being trans\" just \"made sense.\"\n\nWe tried pointing out how a man doesn't have to be stereotypical \"manly.\"  A man can enjoy cooking, kittens, cute things, be \"feminine,\" hate sports, and such, but that doesn't make him *trans*.  It didn't matter.  He just kept repeating things he had been reading that he could relate to.  Stuff that I know I had seen on Tumblr and written by \" transidentitarians.\"\n\nWe then asked about if he experienced any gender dysphoria.\n\nHe focused on his hair.  His hair had been thinning and he was just starting to go a little bald.  To the average person it wouldn't be noticeable, but having known him for as long as we had...we could see that his hair had changed some.  Starting to lose his hair was really bothering him and sure, this is something trans women sometimes struggle with.  But we then asked, what about the rest of his body?\n\nPatrick confessed he had no intention of getting any surgeries.  He was comfortable having a penis and even enjoyed it, but planned on going on HRT to stop his receding hairline.  I asked about therapy and he said he was still looking into therapists to see.\n\nOkay, good.  Seeing a therapist should really help him figure it all out.  The gender therapist I had was amazing in so many ways.  (This was before I met all my friends and in another city, so I couldn't just recommend her to Patrick.)  Now, I want to stress...I didn't want him to see a therapist just so a professional could be like, \"You're not trans.\"  I wanted him to be truly educated on it and not just what some Tumblr blogs told him.  To really explore his feelings, what it all could be, and also...to address his depression.  I occasionally told Patrick before he came out as trans that he should see a therapist as he seemed to be struggling with depression.  He had always hand waved it.  My gender therapist also helped me with my depression and my past sexual trauma.  So just seeing a therapist would help him in so many ways.\n\nAnd who knows.  Maybe Patrick is trans and would really benefit from transitioning in some way.\n\nEven with all of our concerns and questioning, we wanted to be supportive.  We told him he was free to use us as sort of a \"safe place\" to try things.  For example, we would be happy to use whatever pronouns he wanted, we were fine using different names for him until he found one that felt fitting for him.  We told him he could wear whatever clothes with us and it would all be cool.  One friend even offered to accept packages for him since he still lived with his dad and was worried his dad wouldn't accept him as trans.  We wanted to be a place where he could try things before doing so out in public *if* he needed that.  If he wasn't comfortable wearing a dress in public yet, he could when he was just with us.  It's fine!  He was pretty appreciated of it and asked us to call him Pat until he could figure out a name and to just continue with he/him pronouns as that was what he was use to.\n\nA week after he saw a therapist...a therapist he had only *one* session with...he had a letter to start HRT.  He announced it to all of us proudly that soon he was going to start transitioning.\n\nThat was a major red flag for me.  For many of us.\n\nThe first session with a therapist should be about establishing the therapist-patient relationship.  To see if you're a good fit for each other since therapy is so personal and every therapist is different.  *How* can a therapist during the first session say \"Yup, you're trans!  Here's a letter with your diagnosis and a referral to an endo.\"  We *all* asked him to find another therapist.  This seemed so sudden and so drastic.  We brought up the permanent changes HRT can have on his body and he acted like it was no big deal.  Even telling us how he had been researching how to have sperm frozen so that he could still have biological children in the future.\n\nHe wouldn't listen to us about finding a new therapist.  His compromise was to wait on starting HRT after his second session instead of \"right away.\"\n\nThis was when I decided to ask the \"trans community\" for advice.  I shared the story and my concerns.  Brought up how he was able to get HRT after a single therapy session.  I was shocked by what happened.  Everyone just snapped at me.  I got called transphobic, that I was a gatekeeper, and what a terrible friend I was being.  They went on to say that if I wanted to be a supportive friend I shouldn't be concerned about him *trying* HRT because \"it won't ruin her life!\"  I pointed out how HRT does cause permanent changes to a person's body if you're on it long enough, but they didn't care.  I was a transphobic gatekeeper.\n\nThe next couple of months came with some uncomfortable conversations.  We still wanted to be that supporting \"safe space\" for him and so he would talk about new realizations he was making.  To be honest, some things were making me extremely uncomfortable and eventually I was having trouble not being offended with some of the things he was saying when it came to be trans.  Two examples...\n\nOne thing he brought up was when he decided that he would eventually get breast implants.  He said he really liked the idea of being a woman with a dick and compared it to \"futa\".  Another thing we brought up was a reason why he wasn't changing how he behaved when he was out in public was that, \"I don't want to be a girl.  I want to be a woman.\"  He didn't want to dress in his \"preferred\" clothing until he was much farther along in his transition.  He was worried about being seen as a \"girl\" and not as a \"woman.\"\n\nAs I have explained to people, I felt like my body was betraying *me* when I was going through puberty.  I believe Patrick finally understood what I meant by that.  As time went on I felt like I was having to watch him spiral downward and go through hell.\n\nThen one day he came to us and said he was stopping HRT, realized he wasn't trans, and wanted to go back to how things were before.\n\nThis all happened within a year.\n\nIt's extremely frustrating too.  *Of course* I know that for many trans people, treatment is necessary and it is super frustrating that sometimes it is extremely difficult to get.  And this is why I get concerned about stories like this one or the one that prompted me to share.  Unfortunately people will look at these cases and try to say \"See?! Being trans isn't a thing!\"  But I do believe they are important to hear because it shows how gender dysphoria is a *medical condition* with a variety of treatments...it's not just an identity that you can *declare* you are or \"decide\" to be.\n\nThe other frustrating thing is how people seem to assume you can't be concerned about both sides.  I've seen how some people seem to think that you can't support trans people if you do worry people might find themselves having to detransition.  Detransitioning seems to be some taboo subject and that bringing it up makes you transphobic or some kind of bigot.\n\nI'm sharing this story because I do think the whole \"you don't need gender dysphoria to be trans!\" is causing harm to the very community I am apart of.\n\nEdit: Wow, I'm a fucking idiot.

If I want to keep track on graduating in 3 years, I needed to take one more liberal studies class, and this was the only one that fit with my schedule that I knew I would be interested (like I looked into at least 20 different classes other than this one, and all the other classes were full or were at the same time as a mandatory class for my degree).\n\nIn class we were talking about Semenya, and if you don't know who she is, she is an intersex female who has high levels of testosterone compared to other females. I believe it has been stating that her levels are close to 5x higher than the average female. Many claim the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF) has written rules to target her specifically.\n\nHere is the wikipedia link about her if you need more information:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_Semenya\n\nAnd my professor was stating how it's not fair to ban her or force her to do certain things (ie lower testosterone) to allow her to participate, and practically stating that the IAAF is racist and discriminates against black people. And the professor never mentioned anything about Semenya having high levels of testosterone. The whole class was stating how this was unfair of them to do, and that the association is racist.\n\nFor me, I have no idea how this issue relates anything to race whatsoever. It's relating to hormone levels. To be honest, I have no idea of the proper solution to this. I have heard that since this is a natural level increase that she shouldn't be forced to lower her testosterone levels to compete. But at the same time, is it fair for a female who doesn't have high levels of testosterone and is not on steroids (testosterone is by definition a steroid) to compete with someone who does? And I'm not talking about Jane who had a level of 70 ng/dL (or 1.79 nmol/L) vs Lily who has 15 ng/dL (0.12 nmol/L) (random names). These levels are quite different but are still considered normal female ranges. I'm talking about people who have testosterone levels from 5 nmol/L to 7 nmol/L. Men levels after puberty are from 7.7 to 29.4 nmol/L.\n\nIn my mind, if a non-binary ftm was in a professional sport and wanted to be on low dose testosterone (which i am not sure on my beliefs about, but this is a separate topic), then what would such a committee say? Would they said that this hypothetical person be allowed to compete with women or be forced to compete with men? I am not sure what would happen. I'm currently on low dose testosterone, and I'm sure if I wanted to compete in a women's sports league (which I don't), then I probably would be told that I can't because of my testosterone levels, even though they are not at the same level as an average cis male.\n\nI feel like I'm going to struggle with this class a lot since I'm afraid if I voice my opinions (which I think should be considered medical facts like you need dysphoria to be trans) that I will be kicked out of school. Again, I'm at a liberal school and have a very liberal professor. Many people at my school believe in socialism and Marxism (very far left) so I believe my viewpoints would make me the bad guy, even though I am trans myself.\n\nBut your views on this, as well as what should I do? Should I change classes to something that I will feel free to voice my opinion even if I hate the class?

He\u2019s chill about me being trans and we\u2019ve been working together to make some new friends on our floor (the floors are divided by gender so like girls on one floor, boys on the next, and so on). Most of the people were pretty chill and respectful. A few doors down there\u2019s another trans guy and pretty much looks like what you\u2019d expect from a tucute. Blue hair, undercut, loud = funny, don\u2019t need dysphoria to be trans, etc. I thought I\u2019d be fine once I got to know them and hang out with him more, but at this point just hearing his voice ruins my mood. He always talks about how gay he is even if it has absolutely nothing to do with the conversation and uses the terms \u201cdude\u201d and \u201cbro\u201d when referring to me. I became close friends with his roommate so it\u2019s not like I can just avoid him at this point. We could be walking down the street and the navigation could say \u201cgo straight\u201d and he\u2019d go \u201cBuT i\u2019M nOt LmAo\u201d. It\u2019d get a small chuckle out of me the first time, but he does this EVERY .SINGLE. TIME. We\u2019re new here so we use google maps multiple times during the day so I think you can just picture how done I was after the first week... I don\u2019t mind him calling me dude or bro, but I think some of us here know how awkward and forced it can feel when someone just keeps trying to reiterate your gender in every statement. At this point I don\u2019t even care if he\u2019s tucute it\u2019s just him as a person that\u2019s been getting to me, and I just need to vent somewhere where him being trans won\u2019t mean I can\u2019t dislike him... I\u2019m just so tired of hearing him constantly saying \u201chaha we\u2019re all guys!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no girls here just the boys!\u201d \u201cUs guys\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so gay\u201d and always obsessing over Starbucks, Chipotle, teen shows, etc. he\u2019s also a HUGE hypocrite.  Our little friend group will be laughing and joking around then he\u2019ll complain that we\u2019re being too loud and then turn around and be just as loud if not louder, then getting frustrated with me when I point that out or tell him to be quieter. Now he might get kicked out of housing because he didn\u2019t pay all of the deposit. He apparently know it wasn\u2019t paid for the past 2 weeks and just didn\u2019t tell anyone until the Resident Director has to get involved. What irritates me most is how he treats my ESA (emotional support animal). He\u2019s a dog and helps manage the extremes of my bipolar. I\u2019ve put so much time, effort, and money into making sure he\u2019s well trained and healthy. He\u2019s a Labrador mix and hardly even barks. Whenever The guy is in my room he always looks at my ESA like some gross creature and always says \u201cit smells like dog in here\u201d \u201cyour room is kind of trashy\u201d and other remarks like that. When you come into a room with a dog they\u2019ll obviously want to meet you first. He does get a little excited and sits on your feet or sniff you, but other than that it\u2019s just normal dog things. If you don\u2019t like him then STOP COMING OVER. I\u2019m not saying you have to like him I\u2019m just saying stop complaining about him if you can easily just not come to our room. He\u2019s a dog not another roommate. You can\u2019t just expect him to not do dog stuff or things I trained him to do. Like I\u2019ve trained him to hug, lay next to/on me when I\u2019m on the ground, move my hands when I cover my face, a few other things to help when I\u2019m getting manic or when I\u2019m hitting a depressive low to ground me in reality. He hardly even touches or looks at my dog he just stands in the room, complains, and leaves. He has literally no reason to be in here other than to complain. Everything about him just irritates me and I feel like this is the only place I feel safe venting these frustrations even if they aren\u2019t completely trans related. I don\u2019t even know what to do about it. He just clings to me whenever we\u2019re together in a group, almost exclusively complaining, talking about anime, talking about how gay he is, reiterated that we\u2019re guys in every sentence, and always just screaming in my ear thinking if he says the joke louder it automatically makes it funnier. Calling someone homophobic, transphobic, racist, etc for a silly unrelated statement isn\u2019t funny it\u2019s just awkward, confusing, and cringe. He\u2019s also just an asshole to everyone in one way or another. He\u2019s the type of person to insult someone then say \u201chaha iM sUcH a SaRcAsTiC aSsHoLe LmAo\u201d. I just want him a billion feet away from me, but he\u2019s just down the hall. I wouldn\u2019t be shitty to his face though. I figure if I\u2019m nice to him and get him stuff he\u2019ll feel like he owes me and will view me with a bit more respect. It\u2019s worked so far, but being around him is still like taking off a bandages help on with gorilla glue.\n\nEdit: OH! I also forgot to mention he found out my dead name while looking at my computer while I was going through the school portal. He was like \u201cOMFG WE HAVE THE SAME DEADNAME!\u201d and just kept talking about it for the next 5 minutes. I don\u2019t care if we have the same deadname and I don\u2019t like it being talked about. I made it very obvious that I was uncomfortable by his constant mentioning about how they\u2019re the same and how he\u2019s \u201c100% telling the truth and it\u2019s sooooooo crazy!\u201d If you\u2019re gonna snoop on what I\u2019m doing and go on and on about something I\u2019ve VERY OBVIOUSLY gone out of my way to keep on the dl you shouldn\u2019t be surprised if I show frustration towards you.

I jumped up in surprise and looking behind me, my stepson was there and he uttered his first sentence in a long time, telling me that he's been wanting to f*ck me since the first day I went into that very house. I tried to run away but he snatched me by the waist and pinned me into his bed. As he was a foot taller than me (I'm 5'4) and has a muscular frame, fighting back was useless and planted bruises on me\n\n&gt;He covered my mouth with force and then proceeded to do things he wished against my will until he was satisfied. In the process, I was resisting continuously until he strangled me and left me too exhausted to fight back. I have lots of bruises too.

I apologise if this barely makes sense, I have been out of the zone since this weekend. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nI originally transitioned at age 17, like 9 years ago. I was fortunate enough to have been able to move after high school to a different part of town and from about 7 years ago I had been living stealth. But that has all recently changed.\n\nTo give some background, there were only 2 people who knew I was trans, both of them people I knew from high school. One was a close friend (Call them P), the other was not that close but they were still friends with P and they are also roommates (Call them O). Recently (about 2 months ago) O started transitioning. Originally they approached me for assistance at which point I told them to speak to a psych to make sure, because it is a very huge thing to commit to and really isn't worth it if its possible at all to live as a cis person ( I thought that was the right thing to do at the time and I really am quite awkward). Well, O kind of heeded this advice, they visited multiple psychologists until they found one who did HRT on the first appointment, the rest were gatekeepers apparently. But, I was not miffed that my advice wasnt taken as I really dont care at all about any of this.\n\nO began their transition and everything was fine until I heard that rumors were being spread that I was a transphobe within that friends group. That was fine and all, I still didn't really care that much. As time went on O would approach me for information regarding transition and asked me to do a bunch of things like going bra shopping etc etc. I declined as nicely as I could because I just don't like thinking about that part of my life and that was a very long time ago that it was at all relevant to me and I went on living normally. O was very out and proud, they had a trans flag on their car, in their room, trans necklace etc etc they refused to wear wigs or makeup despite having very masc features and buzzcut short hair, but would still shout at people for misgendering (Multiple occasions) that kind of made me not really want to spend time with them too often.\n\nI then kept getting messaged by O that it was my responsibility as a trans person to be proud about it and to help others and that it was very horrible that I was living stealth, that just because I had the privilege to pass I had to help other transgirls and that being stealth was transphobic and I had a responsibility to the community to help and to show my trans pride etc etc. They also tried to get me to quit my job since I have a government role (Tax investigations). I did a decent job deflecting this but at this point it was getting uncomfortable.\n\nIt all culminated at a party last weekend, it was just a birthday for a mutual friend. I knew I shouldn't have gone but I really care for P and I couldnt help wanting to spend time with P. After about an hour at the party I got somewhat uncomfortable at O's antics and decided to leave. I just said that I needed to pick someone up and said bye to everyone and left. I'm not exactly sure how it happened next, but O then somehow outed me to everyone at the party, from what I can gather they were just saying things like \"wow, look at how far she has come\" type deal and showing pictures to people of me from high school and one picture of me at age 19/20ish (I don't know the exact photo) from when I was still kind of halfway. They then posted something similar to my facebook where I was tagged, I am not sure how many people have seen it but my work friends have.\n\nI still haven't said anything about it. I have had a few messages along the lines of \"wow I never knew\", \"you should have told me\" and one coworker with a \"so brave\". I haven't gone to work all week and I really don't know what to do now. The sandcastle that I spent so long building has now been kicked down and to make things worse I can't spend time with P becuase O has said that P spending time with me makes them suicidal. P doesnt believe it, but doesnt want to risk it.\n\nIt is all so absurd it doesn't feel like reality, it happened so fast that I still am kind of reeling? I really hate this. I spent so long avoiding this and avoiding anything relating to my past and now to have it all kicked down. I feel so fucking helpless, is this my future. Is this what everything is going to be for the rest of time that I have to spend every moment of my life looking down every avenue to make sure there's no opportunity for me to be outed in any situation.\n\nI am dreading going back to work and I really want to move cities and just get away from this all. I don't know what to do? I don't know what I did to wrong them like this? I am tired of being punished for something which was not my choice in the beginning. Keep in mind this is one side of the story, but I really was trying to play this as nicely as I could. Its so fucking absurd, everything is absurd, this is my life, its absurd, its a joke.

I\u2019m a 14 year old male and I\u2019ve been dealing with anxiety over my gender identity for around 3 months now. Last year I questioned my gender identity on my own, after showing a bit of interest in crossdressing and generally feminine activities. I came to the conclusion that I am cis. However, this year I made the terrible mistake of visiting r/egg_irl, effectively curbstomping my mental and physical health which had steadily been improving since I realized I\u2019m gay. I grew paranoid that my dislike of my body hair and liking of more twinkish/androgynous body types made me a trans person in denial. I later realized that isn\u2019t true and I can just like those body types. Crisis over right? Nope. In come intrusive thoughts, popping up and making me think I\u2019m going to cut my dick off or grow tits. Despite these thoughts literally being my worst nightmare, egg_irl still manages to make me think I\u2019m in denial. It doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019ve developed a transgender porn fetish during this time. This is around the low point of my mental health, and sometimes I would grab a pocketknife and hold it next to my wrist while wondering what it feels like to cut myself. Never actually did it, thankfully, but it was way too close for comfort. I started mistaking my anxiety and fear for dysphoria, causing more anxiety and fear. My original thought process of \u201cwell even if I do have dysphoria I\u2019ll just get therapy and take antidepressants\u201d was invalidated by them claiming that it wouldn\u2019t work, and the only way for a dysphoric person to live is to transition, else they\u2019ll just kill themselves. Despite looking up the symptoms of intrusive thoughts and matching all of them, they still convinced me I had dysphoria. Eventually I realized that my constant use of this subreddit to try to make sense of everything was causing me harm, so I took a break from social media for several days. During that time I realized i was getting fucked with, and I shouldn\u2019t listen to these people. When I came back however, I started to fall for their bs again because I was scared of becoming transphobic. Eventually, after another bout of anxiety and fear I realized I needed to break the cycle somehow. I found this subreddit, and things started to make more sense. I\u2019ve mostly gotten over the crippling fear and anxiety, but I still get anxious when I hear people describe their transition and I still have intrusive thoughts of being trans and they still scare the living shit out of me. I feel like the Soviets trying to rebuild Stalingrad after WW2.

She called trans people egotistical because apparently the reason people transition is to boost their ego by having people call them what they want to be called, and a lot of stuff about them only committing suicide because they are too fixated on identity.

I just wanted to know your thoughts from the other side of the trans pond and get your thoughts on it. How does it make you feel? Is it something you would consider? Why or why not? Do you have any feelings (positive or negative) about trans women who take this route?\n\nEdit: since this is getting some downvotes I just wanted to clarify that I don\u2019t have any positive opinions about the procedure. I just wanted to word the question in a more neutral way as to not seem biased leaning on way or another. It\u2019s not something I\u2019m not comfortable seeing and view it as something overall different from traditional bottom surgery. To me it sort of borderlines on a fetish of people with both and makes me uncomfortable the amount of traction it is getting in the community.", "date": "2019-09-19 15:43:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d6fv8o/what_are_your_thoughts_on_mtf_bottom_surgery_that/", "author": "NotPreferred"}, {"title": "[Unpopular Opinion] If you live in a place with Universal Healthcare, you don't get to complain about transitioning", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-19 17:26:30", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d6hb0q/unpopular_opinion_if_you_live_in_a_place_with/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Observing tumblr\u2019s mogai trenders like animal planet", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-09-19 19:44:21", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d6j7km/observing_tumblrs_mogai_trenders_like_animal/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Lack of support", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-19 22:42:18", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d6lm6b/lack_of_support/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Controversial?", "text": "", "date": "2019-09-20 00:36:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d6n1to/controversial/", "author": "dinkitysplink"}, {"title": "Its driving me crazy.", "text": "I dont really have bottom dysphoria but seeing people talk about their \"girldick\" makes me want to get rid of it even quicker.

Never force yourself on other people. Be patient, be understanding.**\n\n1. Do not expect or ask people to call you different pronouns from how you are perceived. Make progress in your transition and earn your pronouns.\n2. Understand that transition isn't going to happen overnight. It takes alot of time. Just because you just started HRT doesn't mean the world should start seeing you differently.\n3. Be subtle. Change your clothes overtime. Don't just start wearing dresses when you have a beard or beard stubble and have put no time into your transition. And remember feminine clothes don't make you a woman. They only accentuate your innate femininity.\n4. Don't ever get angry at strangers who misgender you. (I.E. GameStop mam) Be honest with yourself. We are not delusional because we are trans. If you frequently get misgendered by strangers then guess what your not there yet. Remember to be patient. Take your pills and allow time to do its thing. Strangers will eventually start to see you as your true self once you put enough time and work into it.\n5. You don't need to announce yourself to the world. If you decide to begin your transition journey feel free to explain it to your family but you don't have to make everything about you being trans. No matter what you are still you. Being trans is your condition not your identity. Don't demand your co workers start calling you she until they feel comfortable doing so and you look the part.\n6. If you get misgendered frequently. And still look masculine. DO NOT USE WOMENS RESTROOMS. This comes back to the rule do not make people uncomfortable. Make sure you pass consistently for many months before deciding you belong in women's spaces. Look for a family restroom or single stall restroom if possible or use the men's room. And if you do pass be normal. Go in make sure you sit to pee. Or whatever do your business and leave. Don't hang out in there. That's weird. Don't be weird.\n7. You don't just physically transition. You also need to fit in socially. IMO if your actually trans a lot of the social graces of being a woman should come naturally to you or be innate. But make sure to be aware of how you are acting. Don't start fights, curb aggressive behaviors. Don't let anger consume you.  Have class!!!!!! Practice good hygiene. Don't be gross or engage in gross behaviors. Don't act like a man.. cause your not right?\n\nCan't think of anything else at the moment. I'll add more if I think of stuff. Feel free to add to this.

I minored in gender studies in college in the early 2000s, and that's how I first came across the concept of a nonbinary gender. We didn't discuss it in class at all, it was just something I found in a textbook. Immediately, I felt a weight off my shoulders like things finally made sense, but I'm not really the kind of person who wants to be a pioneer, so I kept it to myself for a long time. When the media, governments, and the medical profession started recognizing nonbinary people as real, that gave me the courage (over the span of several years) to come out to a few people, experiment with a gender neutral name, legally change my name, and have chest masculinization surgery. I feel so much more at home with myself now than I ever have, but I can't seem to connect to the general nonbinary community.\n\nI don't spend much time talking to strangers online in the first place, and I'm fine with that. So after I joined some nonbinary facebook groups, I had some questions. A big one was if you don't have dysphoria, how could you know that you're trans? I asked a friend and she kindly, but patronizingly, explained euphoria to me, which I didn't totally buy, sounds like either crossdressing or relief from unacknowledged dysphoria to me, but it seemed pretty clear that I wasn't supposed to ask these things. And it feels really weird to try to be in a community where questions are off-limits, everyone is automatically valid all the time, scientific studies are scorned, and it seems like so many people's basis for calling themselves nonbinary is just that they don't fit into rigid gender roles or they like to dress a certain way.\u00a0\n\nThen again, it's none of my business, people can call themselves what they like, and I don't want to be a jerk to anyone. But spending time reading groups like that has made me concerned about how people might perceive me when I tell them I'm nonbinary (and I only tell close friends or people who ask). In moments of weakness, it's even made me wonder if it's all bullshit and I made a mistake. I always thought my therapist who wrote my surgery letter was too affirming and didn't question me enough. But reading this sub over the past few days has really grounded me. My chest dysphoria was serious and real, and surgery remedied it. The only times in my life I've been content to be seen as female were when I was consciously acting out a role and just deciding to have fun with it, all the while feeling like I was getting away with a secret.\n\nI've seen several people on here suggest that some/all nonbinary people might be binary trans and just haven't accepted it yet. So before anyone asks, it crosses my mind. It's possible. But I'm happy enough with myself the way I am now.\n\nAnyway, I'm glad to have found you folks.

They aren't as realistic I guess. You know what I mean probably.\n\n  I need help, I don't know if I'm actually trans or not and if I have actually dysphoria or not.

I again am amab and the only thing throughout my childhood that has been constant is my obsession with science and fact. And everyone knows the first thing thats child learns is that you are born either a boy or girl based on biological differences. Everyone understands that it's a *fact*. I bring this up because ever since some time in my young childhood I had the thought of \"I wish I was born a girl\". But since all I knew was that since I was born a boy, I could not ever be a girl. Becuase that is fact, that's just how the world works. But it never stopped me from being jelous over other girls and not playing with boys my age because I just didn't fit in. For clarification this was not something the other kids did, I willingly secluded myself from the other kids. \n\n  Now be me 18 in a very terrifying short amount of time, and a senior in highschool. (late birthday woooo) Literally freaking out that I have no idea who I am. Freshman year I basically accepted the fact that \"yeah I don't really think I'm normal but I'm not trans, that only happens to other people\". I had this mentality for a very very long time. Even though I would buy feminine clothes to wear secretly just because I liked them. But it's not that simple because I would justify to myself that \"it must be my fetish\" and that was an acceptable reason to me. I did not start to buy clothes because I was a crossdresser. I bought the clothes and then to justify it to myself concluded I must be a crossdresser. But I don't even know if that's true, because alot of posts here make it seem if you think being trans is apart of anything sexual your wrong. \n\n  This makes me feel terrible because I'll admit almost everytime I watch porn I wish I was the girl. And when ever I fantasize about things sometimes I think of myself as a girl. The other times I'm very very feminine but male. And I also absolutely hate the idea of having penetrative sex. I have a completely disconnect that's just wrong the though of me doing that to someone else is just wrong it's not right. I don't know how to describe how I feel about that but it's just wrong. Anyways this is all stuff that is sexual and now I have incredible doubt of my validity of being trans. Because what if it really is \"just a fetish\" but I really really really don't feel that way. However people post that if you connect yourself being trans to anything sexual you are just a monster and pretending and fetishising people. \n\n  This makes me seriously feel like shit. And that I'm just a terrible human being. I don't know if I'm just stupid or what. Also, I don't *hate* my body. Or at least I don't think so, I feel indifferent too it, if anything a negative view on it. And so many others talk about how much they hated their body. But I still wish I wasn't born male, if anything I hate the fact that I just wasn't. I really wish I was just born cis of either gender, I hate having this internal conflict literally everyday. I don't know who I am, and I haven't really known for a long time. And it's literally tearing me apart, I feel so impossibly fake calling myself trans but I just cannot relate in the slightest to calling myself a very feminine male. Like I know biologically I'm male and there is nothing I can do about it.\n\n  I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. This is just a desperate plea for any amount of help. There's literally so much I could say, but I think this is already stupidly long as is. Ask whatever and I'll try to clarify stuff but they'll probably end up just as rambl-y and long. Sorry for how bad this probably is.

It almost feels like an advertisement or agenda is being pushed, like \"Hey come be trans with us. Join us\" Idk it just seems sketchy to me and weird that you'd want to crack someones egg or make them trans, almost cult like in a sense. This ideology can and will royally fuck a normal person's life, body, and mental health in half. Also even though all this inclusiveness is said to let people be themselves, it's kind of doing the opposite. Instead of people just dressing how they want and liking what they want they have to be either non binary, trans, or some other made up label. It's like gnc isnt really a thing anymore.

That person saw my introduction and decided out of the blue that we should be friends and sent me a friend request. They sent me a friend request which I accepted. We talked for awhile and they were saying that they were a cis guy who wants to be a girl but, doesn\u2019t think they can. I tried being friendly and sending them resources and encouragement. Trying to make them feel better about themselves in a non romantic way. They did the same to me. We talk almost every day and send each other funny videos and music. We also became very open with each other and got to know each other pretty well. They asked me about my experience as an FtM and I shared it and tried educating. They said that they would treat me like one of the guys and they did. We mostly just talked guy stuff and told dirty and off color jokes to each other. Since we were both talking about our transition goals and I showed them a picture of me asking what haircut they think would look good on me. They said I was cute and attractive. Then one time we decided to do voice chat and we started talking life. They asked me some pretty explicit questions, asking me if I masturbate or do I like to be the masculine one sexually. Pretty much asking if I\u2019m top or bottom, which I stupidly explained thinking it was just another education moment. They also ask me what I\u2019d rather have sex with and when I said girls they said, \u201cWhy? Not to be explicit but, my thing with two girls is that there\u2019s no sex its just fingers and mouth. If you ever considered boys we could go hard just saying\u201d. I said no, not realizing they were hinting at something possibly. The next weekend that we talk on dm and I show them a picture of something I drew and some songs from some bands I listen to. I also show them another selfie of me, nothing inappropriate just a picture of my sideburns asking about shaving. They said they wanted to be a male mentor for me and I asked them about shaving and showed the little bit of facial hair I have. They then say, \u201cDamn boy, I\u2019d love to wrestle you\u201d I asked what they meant and they responded, \u201cHave hot sex with you\u201d I was shocked considering I am 17 and they are 26. I tell them, \u201cDude, you\u2019re fucking 26 and I\u2019m 17 that\u2019s fucking weird\u201d They say, \u201cOh, so you're gonna play the age card. I\u2019ll go then\u201d. Then they tell me they\u2019re into me and I just type lmfao repeatedly thinking they\u2019re drunk and they got pissed and said, \u201cFuck off if you think I'm a joke. Dont fucking laugh at me\u201d They then tell me to give them a chance and accept that they\u2019re male. I said no again and they said, \"Come on, give a guy a chance\".They decide to get hot with me on vc and ask me the same questions as last time about, whether or not I masturbate. They point blank tell me they\u2019re sexually attracted to me and want me all over them. Later on they say, \"2 guys would be hot together, I wish you'd consider it\". Though another thing about us is that we have a lot of shit in common from personality, interests, both introverts, and both closeted trans people. I thought we were just close friends. I totally didn\u2019t expect this. So far we\u2019ve only known each other for 3 weeks or a month idk. What do you guys think. Am I just getting paranoid for no reason. They said they want me to be happy and they want to be emotionally the girlfriend for me but, then again fake people or predators take advantage in whatever ways they can. I don\u2019t know I was flattered at first but, now hella uncomfortable and on edge. What do you guys think? I of course blocked them but am extra weary and way less trusting of \"accepting\" people. I only attract fake people as friends it feels like. What sucks is that I thought I had a friend who understood me and it was cool having another trans person to talk to, especially one I can relate to with being closeted.", "date": "2019-09-26 15:24:19", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d9l4em/can_trans_people_be_chasers_if_thats_what_this/", "author": "hollowskull499"}, {"title": "\u201cBut I\u2019m not cisgender, though\u201d", "text": "", "date": "2019-09-26 16:24:51", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d9lynf/but_im_not_cisgender_though/", "author": "TheLoudNoise"}, {"title": "AGP is real? is only a terf lie? im very afreid of being a AGP, i dont know why, i have dysphoria and i love to being treated like female in normal life, but what if...", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-26 16:57:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d9mf35/agp_is_real_is_only_a_terf_lie_im_very_afreid_of/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "This shit makes me wanna unplug (pretty sure it's unironic too)", "text": "", "date": "2019-09-26 17:02:30", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/d9mhk0/this_shit_makes_me_wanna_unplug_pretty_sure_its/", "author": "punkfence"}, {"title": "Tucutes argue that the neurological similarity to one's gender identity is too small to be relevant.", "text": "I know that I've posted multiple times in this sub today but I really want to throw this out there and get your opinion. \n\nTucutes argue that trans people's brain activity matching their gender identity is not proof that you need dysphoria to be trans/ there's an inherent biological link between being trans and your biological/neurological make up. I've seen them argue this because they say that the difference between binary men and binary women is neurologically so close that diversion from your sex is too small to be significant. \n\nOf course there's a small margin! We're not talking about differentiation between species. We share 80% of our DNA with bananas but I'm fairly certain that they'll still argue that there's a significant difference between the human species and a banana. \n\nWe [truscum/transmedicalists] never argued that the neurological difference between males and females was of astronomical proportion because if they were so completely and utterly fucking different we wouldn't be able to medically transition between the two. Like, I can't medically transition into a fucking orangutan despite that we share 97% of our DNA with them. Sure, the difference isn't huge in the scale of the entire universe but it's large enough that it's SCIENTIFICALLY and MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT. Like, there's not a massive difference between our normal cells and cancer cells comparatively but we don't just ignore them because \"it's a small variation.\"\nWhy don't we ignore the cancer cells?\n1) Because although they're really similar to normal, they're significantly different in the medical sense and \n2) they have an outwardly negative affect on our lives. \n\nPerhaps this example wasn't the most sensitive but it was the easiest comparison and it's one that most people will have some understanding because of the current level understanding and campaigning around cancer awareness.

I had to rely on birth control pills smuggled in from Thailand as a young teen.\n\nI read about Kim Petras 10 years ago, where she was the youngest transsexual to undergo SRS in the Western hemisphere. Her parents allowed her to just be herself and were extremely supportive. At age 12, doctors put her on estrogen, so she would never have to go through a male puberty but a female one instead.\n\nI was so hopeful for the future of trans kids. They would never have to go through the struggles that the rest of us did. They would grow up to be understood and loved and accepted. They would be spotted from a young age and put on hormones before puberty. They would grow up to be very passable and cis, which would allow them to blend into scoeity and live a normal life.\n\nBut look where we are today. Every fucking creepy AGP, crossdresser, fetishish, transevestite is now claiming to be trans.  Every snowflake who isn't a sterotypical 100% man or woman is now claiming to be genderqueer/non-binary, and by that twisted logic it makes them \"trans\". However these people are NOT like us. They do not suffer from dysphoria, and therefore do not have the same motivations and endgoals as us.\n\nTranssexuals would not brag about \"girldick\", because it's a source of dysphoria and we want it gone. Transsexuals would not intentionally want to look genderqueer, because we just want to be seen as normal. Transsexuals would not demand people to use the correct pronouns,  because we want people to truly see us at that gender, and not put up a meaningless facade. Transsexuals would not enter a female-only competition and demolish the competition, because it would invoke dysphoria by reminding us how we are different.\n\nAnd society will judge the trans community for this, when the truth is 99% of these nutters are NOT transsexual. How did we get here? How did so many people who are so different from us manage to infiltrate our community? Where did we go wrong?\n\n______________________\n\nMy biggest fear is for the trans kids of today and tomorrow when this craziness blows over. Which parents will take them seriously anymore when they say that they feel like the opposite sex? How many doctors will still be willing to prescribe them hormones when historical data has shown that a large number of people who identified as trans either did not take hormones or regretted taking hormones?  Will society think that their only motivation for transitioning is just because they are just sick perverted fetishists?  What kind of world will they grow up in, where they will be denied permission for many things, because the trenders of today have abused the right to self identify and have completely ruined the good will of society?\n\nWe need to fight and evict non-trans people from self identifying into our community, not just for ourselves, but also to protect the younger generations.", "date": "2019-09-29 16:00:28", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dax15k/i_remember_reading_about_kim_petras_10_years_ago/", "author": "trutrans"}, {"title": "Subs like /r/TransgirlHentai are the reason terfs exist tbh...", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-29 18:28:16", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/daz21h/subs_like_rtransgirlhentai_are_the_reason_terfs/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "I\u2019m at my limit man I cant stand it I\u2019m-", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-09-29 20:36:14", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db0tsk/im_at_my_limit_man_i_cant_stand_it_im/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Friend issues", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-29 23:32:10", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db31xp/friend_issues/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Got banned from the bisexuality subreddit for", "text": "Saying there are only 2 genders", "date": "2019-09-29 23:36:37", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db33za/got_banned_from_the_bisexuality_subreddit_for/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "why are so comparatively few trans people straight?", "text": "", "date": "2019-09-30 00:27:42", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db3pj0/why_are_so_comparatively_few_trans_people_straight/", "author": "unmakethewildlyra"}, {"title": "Sending positive memes", "text": "", "date": "2019-09-30 01:15:35", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db4990/sending_positive_memes/", "author": "Ocean_Kane"}, {"title": "Do non-passing Trans Women have a moral obligation to remain closeted?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-09-30 03:36:42", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db5v2t/do_nonpassing_trans_women_have_a_moral_obligation/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Finally a trans sub that makes me feel like a normal human being [21 mtf]", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-09-30 05:08:42", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/db6sw6/finally_a_trans_sub_that_makes_me_feel_like_a/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Why do you say you need dysphoria to be trans?", "text": "Cis person here just interested in the nuances of intra-trans politics.  \nI'm just wondering why this community decides to define transgender as 'person who experiences dysphoria' rather than 'person who transitions from one gender to the other' which seems to me like a more natural parsing of the term.\n\nLike, of course the vast majority of people who choose to transition will do so because of dysphoria, but let me propose a hypothetical: A man is not uncomfortable being male, but lives in a very accepting area, and decides they would prefer to be a woman.

In other words, you should only compete with and against people who are actively affected by the same hormones as you. It doesn't matter if they're store-bought or homegrown, as long as they're the same, the end. (I am however conflicted regarding transwomen in competitive sports since their bodies have been affected by testosterone (which is a performance-enhancing drug) for so many years, but I currently don't know enough about the biology of transwomen to have a solid opinion about their participation in competitive sports. If anybody can enlighten me, please do!)\n\n**Now to the rant:** I had considered joining a roller derby team for months, so when I met the local team downtown I naturally got to talking with them. We quickly got to the topic of me being trans, because since I'm not on t I had planned on joining the women's team and then leave when I eventually did start, but to my surprise, this WOMEN'S league allowed everyone to play in their tournaments, well everyone except cis men. Yeah, that's right, you could be a full-blown man, 10 years on t and you would still be allowed to play in the WOMEN'S league, because of the genitalia you were born with. I was lost for words, not only have I never seen an attempt to be inclusive backfire that much (literally rubbing in the faces of transmen that we'll never be \"real men\"), but I have also never seen such disregard for human biology in sports.\n\nTestosterone is a performance-enhancing drug. No individuals whose bodies are actively affected by testosterone should be allowed in a women's league regardless of their identity, and If you allow individuals whose bodies are actively affected by testosterone in your league it's no longer a women's league but a uni-sex league. It's one or the other, no in-between. \n\nI obviously told them why their rules (the team didn't invent the rules, the league did, but they were big fans of them) absolutely sucked, not only from a trans person's perspective but also from a sports science student's perspective, but that didn't change a thing. Their counter-argument to everything I said was that banning people taking testosterone would automatically also ban women suffering from PCOS, which is bullshit. One, women suffering from PCOS do not take testosterone and a rule against people taking testosterone would not affect them. Two, the amount of testosterone affecting women suffering from PCOS is (usually) much lower than the amount of testosterone affecting people actively taking it. Three, banning men as a whole, and not just cismen, would be such an easy fix and would not affect women suffering from PCOS at all. In the end, they had their minds made up and nothing I said regardless of scientific support could change anything. \n\nNeedless to say, I'm tired and I no longer feel a need to join their team or league. \n\n(Sorry for bad grammar/bad English in general, it isn't my first language and my bedtime was two hours ago)", "date": "2019-10-03 23:19:16", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dcz00h/being_trans_sucks_but_being_trans_and_into_sports/", "author": "AdorableSalad"}, {"title": "More of a rant than anything", "text": "i\u2019m sure other trans guys see the mistakes some trans guys make in trying to pass.

I've seen a lot of pronouns being put into email signatures, and even come across a man in a suit (no effort to look not male) explaining to people that 'just because I look like a man doesn't mean I am one'\n\nI know any pushback from cisgender people (practically everyone on the Hill) isn't going to go anywhere, and even ruin some careers.\n\nWhat I'm trying to get at is asking whether or not if it's a good idea to have a sort of bipartisan non-profit campaign headed by a (truscum) trans person to push for the medicalization of transsexualism among many other things. or hell, even a truscum getting elected would be great\n\nbelow are some various questions, and my personal answers, you can answer them as well, I just want to get some feedback so I can get some stuff figured out to get this off the ground:\n\n##Who would support this? \n\nI'd imagine the (socially liberal/fiscally conservative) right-wingers could easily get behind this which would also loosen the LGBT rights monopoly the Dems have at the moment (less polarization?), which can bring a new flavor of Republicans to the scene. And moderate democrats might be hesitant at first, but I feel like once we have a lot of people on board, they'll jump off the radical ship that's already sinking. \n\nAnd, I'm sure we'll never get the far left people on board, especially with rule #1 of politics being to never abandon your base, but I'd imagine this could establish a new base with the center left, and center right.\n\n##Should we try to take the infected avenues back, or start from scratch?\n\nI think that going through the current avenues the LGBT community has is a lost cause. They've injected themselves into the institutional networks that the LGBT community has built over the years, and they're practically impenetrable, in terms of doing anything against the prescribed narrative. I feel like starting from scratch, and competing against the previously established avenues would be more effective of actually getting it done. \n\n##What form should this campaign even take?\n\nI think starting the campaign as a social media campaign would be great (especially if we can get big names like Blaire on board), and then it'll hopefully get it enough traction to build into something bigger, which then an actual campaign could be set up to actually be able to set up meetings with Congressmen to work stuff out.\n\n##What would be a good name, or even language in general, for this campaign to use?\n\nI feel like using transsexual, rather than transgender, does a better job at medicalizing the whole thing, as well as distancing from the radical types of people. I'd also imagine that 'transmedicalism' or 'remedicalizing Transsexualism/ity' would being more appealing to the general public than 'truscum' \n\n##Should we only allow trans people in this campaign? \n\nI feel like the image of a bunch of frustrated trans people coming together to find against a radical usurpation of their medical condition can carry a special type of weight, in terms of politics.  But also we're only half a percentage of the population, so finding hundreds of dedicated trans people who agree with the cause would be difficult.\n\nIt also shields us from certain criticism from the left, as a bunch of cis people trying to control what it means to be trans isn't a good look, especially with the intersectional lense.\n\n##Is this the right time to start something like this, to keep the reactionary measures from being too bad? \n\nI feel as if right now, or within the next couple of election cycles is a great time to start combating this type of stuff.  The pendulum has being swinging in favor of blind trans acceptance, and now since people are starting to wake up to the authoritarian nature of these activists, and they're fed up and tired of it, which opens the door to an over correction which can lead to a demagogue using that frustration to actually end up causing genuine oppression of trans people. \n\nI think by starting a campaign like this, we can hold back the pendulum from going too far, and end up with sensible restrictions to hormones and the reworking of self-ID laws instead of no hormones for anyone and harsh bathroom restrictions\n\n##Any other thoughts? \n\nobviously, an unwritten major goal of this theoretical campaign would be to normalize transsexuality (and I mean to show the public we're just normal people, not the intersectional 'normalize' meaning to make everyone put up with their bull), and fight back against the loud minority of radicals that have hijacked the trans label and movement.\n\nI'm personally very passionate about this, and I really want to see something come of this. If you, or anyone you know, have connections that can help this come to fruition, please DM me so I can work something out with them.\n\nAlso, sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile, and sorry if any of this seems rambly, hopefully this all made sense, and obviously from the US, but you don't have to be American to discuss this, any discussion is helpful.\n\nedit: clarification\n\nedit 2: formatting", "date": "2019-10-06 20:19:03", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/de8qso/do_we_need_a_sort_of_political_coalition_movement/", "author": "PulpFictionBriefcase"}, {"title": "This was in someone's post on r/mtf about their shitty college professor", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-10-06 20:40:52", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/de922u/this_was_in_someones_post_on_rmtf_about_their/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "/r/actuallesbians has been locked due to trans/TERF related drama?", "text": "Any details?

I feel a bit like i post here too much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBut anyways I've been really really confused about my identity. I'm not sure if I'm trans, and I feel like I know something as big as that.\n\nI didn't experience a lot of dysphoria as a kid, but looking back on it I cross dressed a fair amount any only stopped when I was mocked.  I always wanted to grow my hair out, but my mom never let me. It felt almost physically painful to have my hair cut. I never really thought about being a girl, but I didn't really think of myself as a boy\n\nDuring puberty I started disassociating really hard, which correlates when I started masturbating, which only kinda felt good. I didn't really think of it as a sexual activity, I just did it because I was misserble in my school and home life.\n\nI had an identity crisis in high school, but gender wasn't really a part of it. I was just disgusted by my body and specifically my naked body, and I dealt with these feelings by changing my style, and then trying to forget about my body. I saw my hair, which was pretty long, and I cut it because I was disgusted by it with my face. I felt like a gross perverted man, and I hated that feeling. I did think of gender a little, and transitioning into a woman, but I dismissed those feelings because I thought I was equating womanhood with being effeminate, which felt wrong to me. I asked a friend if he thought I would be able to pass a girl, and he said no. That made me pretty sad.\n\nNow I'm in college, and I'm really confused. I have started grow out my hair again, and I've learned to take care of it. Sometimes when I look in the mirror, I see a woman and that really makes my day. I notice I almost have a high when I see myself as a woman. I've started shaving my legs, and that also makes me feel really good. I've notice I feel more like a woman in social situations then I feel like a man, which is bizarre because I'm still presenting as an effeminate man (but not explicitly feminine, I don't wear dresses or do makeup, but still not anywhere near masculinity).\n\nI question constantly if I experience dysphoria. I had to wear black dress pants, which made me almost cry because they felt so manly, but after about 30 minutes I felt nothing, which made me feel like I was making it up. When I see a man in the mirror, I either have no connection or I feel slightly distressed. When I think about growing up to be a man, I get really distressed but I feel like its inevitable, and I need to accept it like I need to accept death eventually.  I feel like I should defiantly know if I experience dysphoria.\n\nTransitioning terrifies me, and I'm not very interested in having breasts or a vagina if I'm being honest. I feel like a pervert when I think about having either of those. I have a pretty effeminate face as it is so people already confuse me with a girl sometimes, I just really want to be treated as a girl, have a more effeminate face, and not have a penis because I truly despise my penis. I'm not sure if I've been able to not feel the full effects dysphoria (if I even have dysphoria) because of my naturally feminine features?\n\nI've also found I am attracted to men, but the thought of being a gay man disgusts me. I've looked at gay porn to try to see if somethings there, but when I think of my self as a naked man I feel a little sick. \n\nI don't really know what I hope to achieve in this post. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I didn't experience explicit feelings of dysphoria growing up, and I've really only been able to call it dysphoria since I've started questioning my identity. Is this a normal thing, or is it an indication I am cis? Am I just categorizing different emotions as dysphoria?  I've been seriously questioning for about 2 years now, and I guess some input would be nice. really sorry if this is too long, and thank you if you read the whole thing.", "date": "2019-10-07 01:19:11", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/decjiq/how_long_were_any_of_you_unsure/", "author": "Ithinkthehairisweird"}, {"title": "\"Egg_irl\"", "text": "", "date": "2019-10-07 02:47:58", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dedj5j/egg_irl/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Yo need some names MTF or fem NB", "text": "Do you need some girly names?

it's done. everything went to shit. it's only going downhill from here on out.\n\nall that being said, i'm sure i'm just being dramatic and none of that is the end of the world and i just need a good night's sleep and tomorrow i won't feel like there's absolutely no hope whatsoever, but i just really needed to get all of this off my chest in one of the only places where i feel like i actually maybe can before i lose my fucking shit for good and smash my own head against the fucking wall until there's nothing left of it but mush. seriously. i'm slowly going insane. it's been exhausting to say the least and all this negativity has been slowly dripping into every other aspect of my life to the point where i'm starting to have a hard time caring about anything other than fucking discourse. been there, done that, and it was hell, so i don't wanna fall back into this dumb mindset. just wanna give less of a shit about dumb malicious people online and focus on the fact that there's a whole fucking universe outside of online discourse.\n\nthat's not to say discourse isn't important or that caring about this bullshit is pointless or stupid or that any of you are stupid for actually giving a shit. i'm really not saying any of that. i'm just saying that right now i can't let myself give a shit. i just can't. i'm losing it lmao. and i'm pretty sure most, if not all of us feel like this to some degree at least. \n\nand that's pretty sad, cause i've always been really idealistic and i never thought i'd reach a point where i'm just over and done and would conform to the fact that everything just fucking sucks and that's it, but as it turns out i do have a limit and apparently i've reached it. i can't even relate to any of it anymore. i can't even bring myself to care about political shit that actually matters. i log into twitter and i scroll down my timeline and all i can think is Why The Fuck Do You Guys Even Care About Any Of This Please Grow The Fuck Up. which is understandable, cause most of it really is bullshit, but now it's like... \"why the fuck do you guys even care about anything at all? everything has gone to shit!!! caring about anything at all is downright stupid, you're all stupid for giving a shit period\". i don't really believe any of it, i really don't, and none of that is a personal attack on anyone, but i'm just so fucking tired and i feel so fucking alienated all the time and it's starting to take a toll on my general will to live. i'm not suicidal in the slightest - i would have to actually care in order to let it affect me enough to make me suicidal -,  but as someone who's always been really idealistic and vocal about shit and strongly believed in the importance of fighting for my place and my voice and my beliefs, losing that has been pretty hard to deal with. i feel like most of what i believed in was just stupid and irrelevant and never really mattered all that much or at all, and i'm having a hard time processing that. it feels like my whole life's been a lie and i don't really know how the fuck i'm supposed to cope with that. or with anything at all. i just feel like saying fuck it to it all, but that feels so childish and immature and how i feel about it all doesn't matter either, so saying fuck it is just as stupid as caring. \n\ngoddamn it. this went on and on and i had no fucking idea i was *this* burned out until i started typing all of that.\n\nbut yeah. that's about it. there isn't really a point to any of it, i'm not really looking for solutions or advice or even feeling better. but i needed to fucking get it out there i guess, and i'm glad i have. like i've said i'm pretty sure i'll feel better in the morning and i'll probably even regret posting this in the first place, but right now i'm gonna let myself fucking word vomit all over you guys. i'm sorry about that. maybe you can relate, maybe you don't, and it would sure feel good not to feel so alone and alienated all the time, but that's not why i'm writing any of this. not sure why i'm writing in the first place. but it's not like i can say any of this anywhere else, so the burden has landed on you lmao. sorry about that. and thanks for reading all that if you've made it this far. i truly appreciate it. you guys are my last and only hope i guess - not to find a solution or even comfort but maybe some proof that there's still someone, anyone left in this world who's not completely fucking stupid and/or insane. because holy shit, it's been hard to hold on to any kind of faith that there's anyone at all who's not full of bullshit and entitlement and shit. \n\np.s. oh yeah i am *definitely* gonna regret this in the morning lmao. the embarrassment is already starting to set in. but fuck it, whatever. it needs to be said.", "date": "2019-10-08 07:00:36", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dewfx3/i_think_i_have_finally_reached_my_limit_and_im/", "author": "111kickit"}, {"title": "Lots of good (and cited!) reads on this blog by a MTF", "text": "", "date": "2019-10-08 07:13:54", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dewk0k/lots_of_good_and_cited_reads_on_this_blog_by_a_mtf/", "author": "3hrsleft"}, {"title": "New to sub, have a few questions/advice", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-10-08 12:08:00", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dez1hw/new_to_sub_have_a_few_questionsadvice/", "author": "Bailorama"}, {"title": "How tucutes made me lose all my cis friends/associates...", "text": "So til today i used to be a part of this alternative crowd, almost everyone were some variation of cis hetero punk people/metal heads/rock lovers but we had 2 bisexuals, 1 lesbian and 1 hetero woman who tried relationship with a woman sometime ago before i joined them, it was quite literally a group made of alternative people of all walks of life.\n\nAdd to that recent explosion of tucutes being in media recently and how the image of trans people are \"triggered at everything tucutes that you can't make black humor jokes in vicinity and who are sexual predators\" in their eyes and as a result the group owner told me today how i am no longer invited to their events(board games, card games, stuff like bowling and pool)...\n\nSo sincerely thank you tucutes!....", "date": "2019-10-08 12:50:14", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dezi3n/how_tucutes_made_me_lose_all_my_cis/", "author": "Gatemaster2000"}, {"title": "Can't we make peace with tucutes?", "text": "Hey\n\nI've been thinking about this for quite a while.

I'm perfectly sure that I'm good for literally nothing - and to top it all, I question. \n\nCan this calm serene dislike towards myself and little female details in my body be a sign of something?

This to me seems normal, expected, and not problematic, but I have found myself re-engaging with the same sort of questioning that I did when I first began my transition.\n\nA particular sticking point in this is my non-standard narrative regarding my relationship to my gender.\n\nI have always identified with the \"truscum\" (weird name) perspective on these issues, noticing the marked disparity between folks who have identities, interests, and goals beyond their gender but happen to be trans, and those who seem consumed and obsessed by gender and \"transness\" and who seem to present themselves in a sort of tone-deaf, often offensive way. I know there are shades of grey with all of this, of course.\n\nThat being said, I realize that I have some legitimate insecurities when it comes to my own \"transness.\"\n\nI transitioned out of dysphoria and a sense that there was no real other option for me if I was to have a future in this life. When I began my transition, it felt like I was giving in to something that I had decided a long time ago was right for me, something that I was sort of dancing around and not looking at for a long, long time.\n\nWanting to be female is probably my earliest memory, along with the shocking realization that all boys didn't also want to be a girl. Genuinely thought that wanting to be a girl was part of being a boy.\n\nAs I grew up, I began crossdressing occasionally. As I entered adolescence, this crossdressing was accompanied by sexual arousal, leading me to conclude that I could not be transsexual, as I did not 100% loathe my body and I had erections when I wore those clothes.\n\nI have a distinct memory of \"deciding\" this when I was probably around 11-12 years old. Even then it felt ambiguous and not certain... I knew my feelings were not sexual\" in their entirety and yet there was sexuality present and, again, did not feel \"trapped in the wrong body,\" which is what I assumed was the prerequisite to being transsexual.\n\nAs I grew this part of me that experienced life as a female was just kind of in the background, and was something that I told myself I would \"work out\" when I got older. As I moved through puberty, I felt like I was going through two puberties at once. One was me a boy, with my body becoming something that I now *did* feel I was trapped in, and another was as a girl: I began to develop crushes on people \"as\" a girl, I began to feel jealous of the girls I knew, my sexual fantasies started to almost invariably involve me as a female.\n\nAgain, the fact that my sexuality intersected with these feelings made the non-sexual aspects of this part of me feel invalid, ESPECIALLY once I was exposed to Blanchard, AGP, etc.\n\nThis went on, yadda yadda yadda, until I found myself in my early twenties. My life was stalled and had been for some time. I continued to move to different places around the country (I'm from the US), thinking each time: \"maybe if I get a fresh start I can figure this out.\" I stopped developing relationships or pursuing serious opportunities because it felt like a lie to be considered a man. My life felt like it was spiraling down to a small point where the only option to escape and have a chance to be a *person* was to make the leap and transition.\n\nIt was rough going at first, lots of insecurity (a tendency of mine, it seems), but eventually gave way to maybe the most emotionally stable period of my life yet experienced. I have been simply *living* for the first time in my life. I have been in a stable relationship for a year and a half, and I have been excited about getting SRS and having one less major thing to worry about as I move through the world and have sex with my partner.\n\nBut my insecurity and anxiety has reared its head. I find myself compulsively reliving that moment when I was a kid, \"deciding\" I was not trans, couldn't be. That I *must* be a crossdresser... It makes me feel invalid, it makes my happiness feel invalid. Makes me question my decisions.\n\nSo yeah, this is a crazy long post and I'm not sure what, if any, response I will receive. I guess my interests are two-fold here: genuine intellectual interest around how many folks on this sub might have similar experiences to mine (I know anything vaguely \"AGP\" can be taboo, but I think there is a great deal of sexual diversity among trans people), and then more simple reassurance or camaraderie. I don't have any real trans friends anymore, so I feel alone with my thoughts. Even with the weird name, \"truscum\" trans people seem to be the ones that I would get along with :)\n\nIf you read this, thank you for your time.", "date": "2019-10-14 14:00:42", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dhqyi6/looking_for_camaraderie_thoughts/", "author": "thr0wawayh3yh3y"}, {"title": "Well I'm officially truscum", "text": "I won't use a throwaway account because I'm not ashamed though. \n\nFor the context : I speak French and most of my French friends are feminist women ; so it happened on a French-speaking page called \"neurchi de misandrie\" (misandrist's corner). I joined because, even though I am a (trans) man, I'm able to take a joke and stuff was pretty funny over there. \n\nUntil a few weeks ago. There was a post asking the men on the group to justify why they joined (mods threatened to ban them) and the post was solely addressed to cis men. Like, there's absolutely no toxic masculinity amongst trans men? Lol. So I commented explaining that even though my transition was fairly recent I've always been socially perceived as man (I just didn't came out as trans until recently) and always felt manly so I didn't experience most of the systemic sexism and other discrimination women have to deal with; explaining that I was kind of an asshole before getting interested in feminism and so on. \n\nOne of the admin (mind you, it's a tucute self-proclaimed non-binary MtF with Xe-Xem pronouns or whatever) replied telling me that this was internalized misoginy, that I couldn't possibly be toxic because I am AFAB and insisted on talking about my past and how I was a woman before. It just made me extremely dysphoric and uncomfortable so I left the conversation. It was so violent and used the same argumentation that TERF use to try to convince me that I ain't trans. \n\nA few days after a cis woman, who organises trans-inclusive speaking sessions posted to complain about a trans woman who had  her vaginoplasty and who shared how it made her feel like \"a complete woman\". Basically she was complaining by saying that it was discriminatory against cis people because it meant they weren't \"complete\" (wut?) and that wanting SRS was just being a \"victim of patriarchy\". Apparently her and all the people present during the session proceeded to roast that trans woman. I can't imagine how she felt. \n\nThen they (the OP and group members, about 15 of them) proceeded to circlejerk, saying that transmed were awfully violent people and so on... I had to comment to explain that when lower dysphoria is bad, you can't see yourself with your genitals and that yeah I can understand how getting SRS would make you feel you again (I don't even plan on getting SRS myself...) and that it was strictly personal and at no point did it meant that trans people not getting SRS weren't accepted or that cis people weren't fully human. \n\nThey spent the next 8 hours bashing me, telling me I was an horrible person. At no point in the conversation they listened to what I said and even though I left the group after an hour or so, and then went to sleep, they kept sending me PMs with insults. It's just target harassement at this point wtf is wrong with them? \n\nI've blocked them / reported then to Facebook since, that was 3 days ago but I'm still pretty shocked. I don't know where I said something wrong, I was just trying to be considerate and to put perspective into their nasty opinions.

Then I checked out, took a 4 year internet hiatus and spent my time drowning in work. When I logged back into gay society 4 years later, after coming out to like 2 friends, I discovered I was apparently transphobic. All the lesbian websites were suddenly calling people transphobes if they were penis repulsed and didn't try to \"fix\" it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nI support trans women doing their thing in life but I couldn't support people telling women we \"owe someone\" our bodies or trying to convince us we're bad or unempathetic for not having sex. It wasn't the trans community I remembered anyways. The whole cotton ceiling thing gave me a weird feeling and I couldn't believe so many people supported it. I got a strange, scared feeling from everything I read, thought I was going crazy. Felt the same as being gaslighted.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am mostly here to tell you that it is extremely difficult, almost impossible to find moderate opinions on trans issues. (And that's scary.)\n\nGoogling \"lesbian confused am I a terf\", \"am I transphobic penis repulsed lesbian\" will get you articles that call you a TERF, (or they did as of 4 months ago.) Something like  \"trans 2019 all anime incels?\" will bring up gendercritical. \"Trans women in sports fair\" brings up woke philosophy and 70 page academic articles that no random concerned sports dad is gonna read through. \"When did Tumblr take over\" gives you nonsense about Yahoo aquisition. And so on.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou expect to be able to find anything you search for on Google these days but there's no middle ground left to dredge up. Try it, and see if you can find a moderate or transmed voice online WITHOUT using any special terms. The first time I heard Miranda Yardley's name it was on BREITBART.\n\nWebsites that are more extreme in opinion (xtra woke liberal or conservative) draw their traffic by making readers feel angry or righteous. More traffic equals money. *Then they have better SEO, because they can afford it.*\nThat's why our 2 party system is fucked. That means your searches eventually get more and more extreme if you want to find what you're looking for, you're forced to bastardize your true opinions little by little out of desperation and take what you can get. I found myself typing \"lesbian trans women coercing sex scary\" or \"trans acting like rapists\"  just to get ANY kind of relevant return and pull some fringe reporting out of the engine, even though I never believed most sane people were like that. But the censorship of alternate opinions made me feel like I was in the twilight zone. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBy the end you're convinced you're must be an awful person, because *you just typed those things, didn't you?* And when you finally find a website that says something rational like \"gaslighting women into having sex with you is slimy and bad, trans people are not exempt from this\" you breathe a huge sigh of relief... whether you're reading CNN, or Breitbart.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nIn a similar way I'm sure you couldn't google \"need dysphoria to be trans am I transphobic\" and find a middle of the ground article about people who are frustrated with tucutes. You'll find things that vilify you, call you gatekeepers, and stretch the definition of \"trans\" to the point that it begins to become an erasure of your needs.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nHonestly I was devastated about my own apparent \"transphobia\". I didn't want to be transphobic. People have been threatened with violence for being TERFs, so I assumed I could not really ask questions for fear of becoming the most hated person in my town by accident.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nThis lead to spending time on more extreme subreddits and websites. I wasn't trying to be hateful, I was trying to make sense of what is happening and why everyone was suddenly insane. Now I sense what's happening is that we've somehow been driven into two extreme groups on purpose and everyone in the center has been silenced or pushed to extremism.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nFinding gendercritical and lgbtdropthe-t was a breath of fresh air, but finding this sub was the literal exact same breath of fresh air, (though it's much more aligned with my personality and what I want to believe) Yes I'm comparing your sub to GC as in, I'd probably trust most of you both to dogsit for me or file my taxes on time or something boring like that. Most normal people would see you as refreshingly boring people who demonstrate basic critical thinking skills and disagree like adults. What scared me was what started happening in AL, where any and all dissenting opinions were simply removed.  Not saying there aren't extremists in GC or any other sub. but there are a lot of people who aren't even radical feminists, just confused &amp; fed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a huge influx of people to anti-trans subs recently for this reason. They could easily have ended up in this one instead and gotten the same answers they were seeking but *your voices don't come up when you make a desperate Google search*. Nobody knows you exist anymore, but you were the ones the LGBT community fought for years ago. Every moderate view has been vanished, and lots of people are stuck on the edges wondering how they got there, people who would want to support you if they knew your stories. \nIt seems \"Transmeds\" and a good chunk of lesbians who have been \"TERF\"ed got exiled for opinions that are either common sense, or literal facts *despite the fact that we share our opinions with an OVERWHELMING majority of liberal &amp; moderate people in the US.*  We are all a little different and we all disagree but our common ground is the ability to talk to each other and consider other opinions. We've been discouraged from doing so, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\nI'm worried about why this has happened. The push for being increasingly offended &amp; outraged by each others' language, encouraging an external locus of control, the gradual pushing of boundaries, the splitting people against each other despite similar wants and needs seems like a very sophisticated way to divide up a large demographic group. Similar to splitting the working class against each other, so they don't unite against  wall street. I'm not sure why we got all split up but it seems beyond the effect of woke middle school  Tumblr philosophy. I think there is money that got involved at some point. Maybe some pharmaceutical companies involved, maybe a campaign team or political motive. If it wasn't on purpose, they're definitely taking notes lol. \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\nPlease write more. Please say more. Please consider talking to people you don't usually talk to. Please consider reading other subs and just changing around the pronouns they use in your head if you feel offended by the way they write, but think about if their message is the same as yours. Some of them fell into it like I did. Some of them oppose trenders and people who think \"feeling like a woman\" equals feeling subservient/being sexually dominated, because spreading that idea around really does hurt women. Everyone is just wants people who are willing to LISTEN even if their opinions aren't the \"right\" ones.\n\nWe might disagree with 9% or even 30% or 90% of each others opinions but if we can listen to each other and accomplish something together we can get ahead.  There are truly violent, hateful, and intolerant people out there and I want to fight against them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSorry this is obnoxiously forever long, sorry I'm posting in your sub. I just want to hear from you and hear what you think about all this. Go through my history, quote me, drag me for problematic things I've written, agree or disagree, write a thesis, AMA, leave a bad tripadvisor review, do anything but please don't ban me... I just want to talk like actually talk and listen not argue for the sake of being right.

While trying to figure out if I'm trans I've been looking at all viewpoints which means truscum, tucutes, TERFs, the medical community, detransitioners, and probably some groups I'm not thinking of. In a way, I've become obsessed with finding out if I'm trans.\n\nThe reason it's been so confusing for me personally is because right now, I don't suffer from severe dysphoria. For me, dysphoria isn't about wanting to kill myself or even feeling depressed. It's about looking at women and thinking, \"I wish I looked like that\" or getting annoyed when someone calls me \"sir\". It's about wanting to get laser so I never have to deal with facial hair again and it's about wanting to take hormones, despite knowing it will kill my sex drive, cause ED, make me infertile, and possibly get me fired from my job. I'm still undecided how I feel about br breasts, but mostly because I'm worried they'll make it too obvious I'm trans and make it hard to find &amp; keep a job. \n\nThe thing is, I did deal with severe dysphoria when I was a teenager. I wanted to kill myself and despite living in a small Christian town during a time when transpeople weren't being talked about, I tried to socially transition. I grew my hair out, took on feminine mannerisms, and even told a few people I want to be a girl. \n\nAs you might have guessed, I got bullied for this. I was told I'm \"crazy\", \"a pervert\", \"creepy\", \"mentally ill\", and a lot of other things. I never told my father, but he could still tell there was something off about me and so he called me \"faggot\". And eventually I did decide it had been \"just a phase\". I convinced everyone, including myself, that I was just a feminine guy.\n\nYet despite this, something always felt off and I self diagnosed myself with all sorts of things. I told myself I had Dissociative Identity Disorder, because that would explain why I was still a girl online. Other times I was autistic, because it would explain why I felt like I was \"faking stuff\" that should come naturally and had a hard time forming an emotional connection with others. I even briefly considered if I was a sociopath, because I didn't seem to feel any emotion at all.\n\nNow I'm thinking I've simply learned to dissociate myself from my emotions and that I do still feel dysphoria. Because I'm so dissociated from my emotions, though, it feels more close to euphoria than dysphoria... which many will agree isn't the best criteria for whether a person is trans. \n\nMy point is that the human mind is a complicated thing and sometimes what we think we feel isn't what we're actually feeling. Just like a dysphoric person can convince themselves they're not dysphoric, a non-dysphoric person can convince themselves they are.\n\nFrom detranaitioners particularly, I'm noticing a pattern of sexual abuse. FtM's seem to detransition more than MtF's, because sexual trauma made them hate their bodies. They associate being female with the traumatic event and so they transition, despite not being trans. They almost always regret this, because transitioning was the wrong form of treatment. \n\nAnyway this is an essay already, so I'm ending this here.

I technically go to community college and have a full time job. I've got plenty of friends many of which are LGBT. My family is LGBT accepting and I've never experienced any form of true LGBT-phobia here in my state. I'm also close to three months on hormones. I really only fully introduced myself to the transgender community about 2 years ago. I'm out to my 100% accepting friends and my parents who just don't care who I am. The first time I got my hormones I honestly felt like a kid opening up a present, and honestly I felt uncomfortable with that feeling but at the same time I felt so good. I was making the right choice.\n\n**I want to see if there are others like me here because I always feel different when talking about transgender stuff with other transgender people.**\n\nWithout turning this into a book something in my life never felt right. I was addicted to video games, anime and fantasy during my pre-teens. Things got worse around the time puberty started for all the kids my age. Guys around me started to talk about girls in a sexual manner and every bodies bodies began to change. People started dating and friend groups now consisted of both male and females. I simply just felt a stronger sense of confusion. I also grew addicted to body transformation stories, and body swapping fiction. Something about it amazed me...\n\nI told my parents one day during an argument when I was in middle school that I felt confused and angry all the time. My dad shattered my world and told me that therapy is only for insane people. I would never be THAT PERSON THAT NEEDS A THERAPIST. Knowing at such a young age that something was wrong with me I instantly knew I needed to keep it secret. I could not trust my parents as my problems would only hurt and or scare them. I needed to lie.\n\n\"What do you think of that hot girl\" , \"Oh I'd totally fuck her.\", \"You should date her.\", \"My dick is bigger than yours\", \"This is a man and that is a women.\", \"Are you okay?\", \"You look like your spaced out.\", \"You don't look too good.\", \"We're bros you can tell me if somethings on your mind.\", \"You look so handsome.\", \"You sound just like your father!\", \"Why are you wearing a shirt in the pool?\"\n\nAround early High School I got really good at lying. I could easily respond to questions about sexuality and I could lie my way through any question about my sexuality, gender, personality, and even happiness. Where as in my private life I grew so addicted to trying to understand my confusion I self taught myself psychology. I even managed to take proper care of myself. I STUDIED HOW TO BE A FUCKING MAN. FUCKING STUDIED SO GOD DAMN HARD JUST FOR A FUCKING LIE! How is it that puberty makes men like girls? WHEN THE FUCK WILL THAT HAPPEN TO ME! I cried myself to sleep many nights because I was fucking defective and aware of it.\n\nI could never see myself with a women as I was never sexually attracted to one. Yet for some reason I was amazed by femininity as if it were the best fucking thing in the world. The friends I trusted began to ask if I was gay and that answer was no. Hell no. I could never see myself as I was with a man. It felt wrong.\n\nI was so addicted to finding the answers to my confusion that I developed a severe depersonalization disorder. Around the the start of college I still couldn't answer the questions about my confusion. Yet I felt oddly motivated to continue. \"Fuck it. If I'm still alive I need to fucking survive this shit.\"\n\nI always knew about the LGBT community but never associated with it. Yet all of a sudden in college I started seeing the white blue and pink flag. I started to see people introduce themselves to me with They/Them pronouns. I met a few transgender people. My world shattered again and for some reason something just clicked. So I \"Chose to stop living a lie\" I chose to stop telling myself I'm a man. I chose to stop faking those BDSM test results as 100% dominant.\n\nI looked at a therapist in the eye and said I don't know what the fuck to do with this noodle between my legs. It's annoying, and I'm honestly glad it's small (Oof! Am I right?). I'm open about it. It's weird. It's uncomfortable. But it's better than before. Ever day is better than another day spent lying to myself. At the end of the day I don't care if I look androgynous. I just don't want to be a fucking man. Honestly at some points I laugh at myself thinking \"Well shit of course. It's because I'm transgender\"\n\nIT BOTH SUCKS AND ITS ALSO FUCKING GREAT. I need to re learn all the emotions I fucking hid away. I need to unlearn how to be a man and re learn the more natural feminine mannerism I had when I was a child. FUCK I'D RATHER BE A FEMBOY THAN A MASCULINE MAN. ANYTHING IS BETTER. I openly call myself non-binary and go by they/ them pronouns. I don't really care though...\n\nMy sister apparently guessed I was nonbinary a while ago. And my mom thought she wanted to be a man when she was in high school. But obviously her concept of what she went through is 100% different than what I've always been though and will always be through. My dad accepted me, and then said he smokes weed to get over his troubles like the lazy bastard he is. He even said I could dress \"Exotically\" (Should I be insulted by that???? The fuck?).\n\nConclusion edit: Thanks so much for taking the time to read this. Reading it a day later just makes me feel good for typing the whole thing out. The more I look back the more signs I feel and the more embarrassing events from my preteen time there are.\n\nBack when I didn't know how to cope.... lol...", "date": "2019-10-25 02:11:00", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dmqr5v/first_time_here_so_lets_talk_long/", "author": "Delteis"}, {"title": "got downvoted for commenting on someone who was complaining about their therapist telling them to wait a while just in case they change their mind :) (idk if it goes here or not)", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-10-25 02:24:54", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dmqwrm/got_downvoted_for_commenting_on_someone_who_was/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "How do I help my family come to terms with my transition?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-10-25 08:14:45", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dmubia/how_do_i_help_my_family_come_to_terms_with_my/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "got downvoted a bit for posting my opinion on someone complaining about their therapist telling them to wait a bit before deciding to take HRT.

But im also not sold on \"truscum beliefs\" entirely:\n\n* I believe in NB people even if im not one.\n* There seems to be a lot of people who subscribe to early socialization theories - this is just dressed up terf logic imo. (I.e. a trans woman has male bodied socialization)\n* There seems to be a lot of right winged people in truscum circles (i dont really understand this when right wing politics so clearly demonizes us the world over).\n* While i think dysphoria is integral to being trans, im not sure if i subscribe to the idea that its healthy to place a ton of emphasis on it. I think people get fixated on one particular definition without realizing that there are other forms it can take, resulting in some people delaying their transition.\n\nI guess i just dont know where i fit in?", "date": "2019-10-29 18:25:47", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dotwwc/in_light_of_the_girldick_convo_im_so_fucking_sick/", "author": "XX_Julia"}, {"title": "Mods locked this post, what a surprise!", "text": "", "date": "2019-10-29 18:44:34", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dou6mw/mods_locked_this_post_what_a_surprise/", "author": "ShinyMet"}, {"title": "This is WHY I don't get along with most transpeople, I was trying to be supportive then got called a \"truscum\" bitch", "text": "", "date": "2019-10-29 23:00:46", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/doxwp0/this_is_why_i_dont_get_along_with_most/", "author": "sushigirlxoxo"}, {"title": "As always misinformation at it's best on r/traa", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-10-29 23:31:49", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/doybi9/as_always_misinformation_at_its_best_on_rtraa/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Found this long thing on r/transmaxxing", "text": "I would take photos but it\u2019s way to long\n\n\n\n(Start of post)\nWhy you should transition\n\nBecoming MtF tranny is a way better option than living another 40+ years as male incel.\n\nStep0: watch tsf monogatari\n\nstep1: go to a gender clinic so you can get proper diagnosis.\n\nstep2: begin having fun with dildo, shove it up your ass.\n\nstep3: back up your sperm.\n\nstep4: start hormone replacement therapy.\n\nstep5: removal of unwanted hair.\n\nstep6: breast augmentation.\n\nstep7: facial feminization surgery.\n\n**The experience of becoming female**\n\nHonestly this was even harder to decide to post than my attempt to be  gay 8+ months ago. Because the implications and outcomes have been  completely different. The experience has been completely different.\n\nDisclaimer: Before all of this I 100% completely identified as a man, a  man's man type of internal mindset. Very heterosexual. And gay stuff  just did nothing for me. It was only out of desperation and having the  right features that I attempted this gender transition. By right  features I mean I was only 5'8 starting out and had a 2.7 inches erect  penis. Plus all my facial features are feminine and I was pretty cute  even as a guy. With 4 inches to my height and dick I could have been a  normie or even chad lite. Yet reality is cruel sometimes. Since being on  hormones I have lost some height, so I'm closer to 5'7 now, a true  manlet if I ever decide to return to manhood.\n\nI have been on estrogen for about 6 months now. It all started when I  got my new therapist three months before that. Who referred me to a new  general practitioner he knows. Obviously I told him nothing about being  incel or hating females. Only that I always felt like a girl, which was a  massive lie. I just wanted to get hormones to attempt a gender  transition and hopefully become attracted to dudes like the other trans  on reddit. Who so ironically betray themselves and their cause by  casually posting truth.\n\nI just want to say for the record I don't believe in any of the trans  bullshit about being born that way. Maybe an exceptionally small amount  of them are. Yet if you read their forums or subs its so extremely  common how many of them are just guys who wank to shemale porn and have  autogynephilia. The vast majority almost always speak about how their  brains get changed by hormones. Further proving they are truly male in  the brain. Basically they are mostly cross dressing fetishists. Maybe a  very few of them really were born with a fucked up brain but its hard to  weed out the liars. Since the fake trans just copy what the real trans  say. Yet they let it slip in their posts how much they love tranny porn  or wanking their she cocks. Not that it matters, more trans is always a  good thing. Less beta orbiters and sometimes even trans that are hot.\n\nThe first injection my doctor did for me. After that I did the rest  myself. My hormones were tested before I started estradiol and at the 3  month mark. My testosterone was exceptionally low so he said I did not  need an anti-androgen. I started out injecting every 2 weeks but moved  to once per week after 3 months because I was getting hot flashes due to  low spots in between.\n\nThe changes seemed slow at first. The first week I got sick at my  stomach after the injection. I just felt awful, almost like someone was  flicking my balls with their finger. Not as painful as being kicked in  the nuts though. This lasted for about 3 or 4 days. Then it happened  again after the next injection. It mostly stopped after the 3rd one. By  which time I already had breast buds. Just a short while after that I  started getting serious breast tissue. I had already been out in public  dressed several times even in the first month. But I got a binder so I  could delay social transition. Because I needed more time to master my  female voice.\n\nMastering a female voice was actually pretty tough. It took me about a  month and a half to really sound like a girl. And I was practicing every  day at least 30 minutes. I spent so much time looking up how to do this  and incorporating the advice into my sessions. I would record myself  and play it back to see if I sounded like a girl.\n\nIt was about 4 months in when things really started to twist my reality  into all sorts of fucked. One day when I was wanking I realized I was  still hard after cumming, which was mostly clear at this point. I felt  as if I was not fully satisfied, as if I could keep going. So I kept  wanking and I came again. Then I came again, and again. With no orgasm  declining in quality. I came so many times I wasn't horny for 4 days  afterwards. At which point I came over 10 times. A week after that I  came 40+ times in less than a hour. I actually lost count of how many  times I came. The first orgasm had the most clear cum. Then the first  few after had plenty. Then I would rotate between ejaculating anywhere  from a teaspoon, to a few drops, to a dry orgasm. As my body just kept  making more.\n\nDuring this same time my emotions were becoming far more intense. I  would cry at stupid and random stuff. But crying does not feel bad, it  feels good to release emotions. I would care about stuff that didn't  even matter. It was almost like the hormones were dumbing me down.  Dumbing me down enough to where I could enjoy life. I was starting to  get a feeling, almost like being continually a little bit high. It was  euphoric to say the least.\n\nI only had a bit of feeling in my phantom vagina area. Which was more  than a bit disappointing. So I decided to try to encourage the feelings.  I had phone sex with a couple of guys I met on the net. I role played  the part of the girl perfectly, even moaned like I was loving it. The  next day after the 3rd guy I experienced a massive change. After peeing I  felt this intense surge of energy from my phantom vagina to my chest.  An absolute nuclear pleasure reaction and I thought about the night  before when I had phone sex with that guy. It wasn't long after I  realized what men could do to me, that I started craving to kiss them.  Craving them inside me as I cuddled my pillow while falling asleep.  Craving to be held by a big and strong man.\n\nThe month after that things got even more intense. It was clear to me  that females experienced sex with far more joy than men. Its like having  a dick with sensory feelings that reaches all through up the body and  hooks in the heart. My first experience with a guy was a non chad  friend, who knew I had started a transition and thinks I am actually  trans. We didn't have sex or even oral but we kissed a few times and  cuddled for a few hours. It was magical, the cuddles were even better  than the endless orgasms. Waves upon waves of mental emotion mixed with  sexual waves of pleasure. Its so extremely addicting.\n\nI'm beyond words enjoying my experience on female hormones. I still hate  females, cucks, and chads. This is the turning point for me. If I don't  quit now I will probably end up sterile and unable to break this  intense addiction to female hormones and to men. Finishing transition  will take work but leads to a life of happiness. Not finishing means  going back to a hell after experiencing a heavenly paradise the likes of  which I could have never imagined.\n\nI feel like any choice I make is life wrecking but I was already totally  fucked to begin with. Its so fucked up to crave men, to think of being  dominated by them. My brain so fucked up on female hormones its telling  me it would feel amazing to swallow semen and get creampied. I only have  one cuddle buddy right now but I think about cuddling other guys too.\n\nI have not had sex yet, not even oral but I feel like if a dude mounts  me and creams me while I'm hopped up on estrogen there may be no return.  Because I can already tell getting fucked is another level of pleasure.  Maybe even greater than the endless orgasms or even the cuddling.  Orgasms are just a sprinkle on the icing for female bodies. Things are  so much more intense and amazing in all areas of life. Going from before  transition to right now was like going from black &amp; white reality  in low definition to 4k ultra HD with perfect sound. Even more than  that, its like life is even more colorful now and things are so much  more intense. The sky even looks brighter, stars shine more intensely to  me. Its like hormones grew a lens of happiness in my brain that I now  perceive reality through and its a much more positive experience.\n\nThings look potentially so good, at least better than when it was  hopeless. I don't know if I can ever go through with having my genitals  cut off. I just have like a mental block over such a barbaric surgery. I  think I could live fine with just having male parts. I partially  identify as female but know deep down I'll always be a man because men  are awesome.\n\nI could see this as being the best cope for manlets who are cute. As  long as their face isn't too masculine. I'm not saying its perfect, it  has downsides like having to pee more. Its still a lot better than being  incel forever.\n\n[http://archive.is/oge4A#selection-1481.0-1541.227](http://archive.is/oge4A#selection-1481.0-1541.227)\n\n**Becoming MTF may increase your chances or spreading your DNA in some cases**\n\nYou can still impregnate females by donating sperm if you have it backed  up, sure it will be less convenient but if you are currently  involuntary celibate the chance of you reproducing is so abysmal it's  unlikely to go down further if you make the transition.\n\nYou need to back up your sperm before starting hormone replacement  therapy, otherwise you will become sterile (after 2 years) with no  chance of reproducing.\n\nA lot of homosexual women still like dick and some of these women prefer  sex with shemales over the total humiliation of having sex with males.\n\nThe same is not true for FtM, if you are born female you should always keep your female body without exceptions.\n\n**Examples of people switching gender to improve their life**\n\n[**https://incels.wiki/w/Trannymaxxing**](https://incels.wiki/w/Trannymaxxing)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/pxgrv2ryqwq31.png](https://i.redd.it/pxgrv2ryqwq31.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.redd.it/d032uga0rwq31.png](https://i.redd.it/d032uga0rwq31.png)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://i.redd.it/i7jkadm1rwq31.png](https://i.redd.it/i7jkadm1rwq31.png)\n\n**Giving up your male dignity**A lot of males suffer a lot becuase of their useless pride.

Here are the main differences.\n\nFrom what I have read in literature from medical sources, the  differences between the Chonburri method from Suporn and the penile  inversion method from other surgeons is as follows:\n\n1. Suporn creates more depth. He guarantees at least 6 inches. Other  surgeons come closer to 4 or 5 inches. 2) Suporn makes meshes from the  scrotal skin and uses the scrotal meshes to lign '' the neovagina''.  Other surgeons use penile skin primarily to lign the neovagina. 3)  Suporn uses penile skin to create the '' labia ''. Westearn surgeons use  scrotal skin to create the '' labia''. 4) Only Suporn and Chettawut  perform the Chonburri method. All other surgeons perform penile  inversion. 5) It's called the Chonburri method because Suporn creates an  organ that doesn't exist in a real vagina, in an attempt to create a  homologous structure to the G-spot in real women. This Chonburri organ  is a lump of nerves bundled together that he burries deep down in the  neovagina to extend the feeling to the vaginal canal instead of just ''  the clitoris ''. 6) Suporn discourages hair removal prior to surgery. He  scrapes the hair follicles himself. 7) The Suporn method was invented  by Suporn himself and presented early 2000s to the world. 8) The Suporn  method is much harder to recover from than the penile inversion method.  The TIMs have to dilate 3 times daily for 45 minutes during the first  year. So almost 3 hours of dilation a day for at least a year, not  included preparation of the instruments,... To dilate. 9) Suporn makes  the prostate accessible through the neovagina during surgery by  constructing the vaginal canal face to face with the prostate. 10)  Suporn's prices go up 500$ every 6 months. He currently charges almost  20 000$. 11) Suporn is soon retiring and has trained an apprentice to  take over his clinic. This new doctor is named Dr Bank. 12) TIMs claim  to be able to get wet with Suporn's technique. 13) Dr Suporn trained Dr  Chettawut and they were both trained by Dr Preecha Tiewtranon, the  master of SRS surgery in Thailand. 14) TIMs who go to Thailand get poor  aftercare once they left the country. They can only email these doctors  and can't telephonically contact them. They are required to stay in  Thailand for 1 month after their surgery.\n\nThe other Thai surgeons are:\n\n2. Dr Thep who charges 2500$ and performs an SRS in 2 hours. First come  first serve base. He gives them a bamboo stick to dilate with and they  can go home the same day after the operation if they want. The biggest  complaint with Thep is according to himself : '' hole is not deep enough  ''. Dr Thep performs sex changes under local anesthesia and he offered a  journalist who wanted to know more about the surgical process to talk  with a patient who was under anesthesia on the operation table at that  moment. He offered to pause the anesthesia so that the guy could talk to  the press about his sex change operation. 3. Dr Nara who charges 3500$. Has only pictures with closed legs on his website. Jeesh, I wonder why lol 4. Dr Kuldech who charges the same prices as Nara from his website  judging. This Dr Kuldech had a US patient who almost bled to death on  his way back from Thailand to the US because stitches had dissolved  prematurely. This TIM had gender euphoria because the ER team was  impressed by his '' vagina'' and how the ' 'vulva' ' looked so natural. 5. Dr Preecha from PAI. He gives the TIMs a wax candle to dilate with.  He is 86 now and only supervises surgeries. Dr Burin and Dr Sutin do the  surgeries. PAI charges 8000$ for SRS and this clinic is famous for its  quote that gynos can't tell the difference. 6. Dr Kamol. Charges 10 000$ and has mixed results. 7. Dr Saran charges 8000$ and he butchers westearn TIMs and blocks their email and Facebook once they complain. 8. Dr Pichet who charges 10 000$ and has created bloody messes by  performing SRS surgeries with a graft from their colon. Many of his  patients kept digestive problems and had to wear pads all the time  because their colon graft leaks in their '' vaginas''. 9. Dr Sanguan Kunaporn charges 13000$ for SRS and generally has  satisfied TIM clients but most of his clients are autogynephiles of  older age.\n\n[http://www.supornclinic.com/restricted/SRS/Results.aspx](http://www.supornclinic.com/restricted/SRS/Results.aspx)\n\nIf someone persue medical transition the underlaying condition is almost  always homosexuality, autygynephilia (when born when born male) or  autoandrophilia (when born as a women).\n\n[https://surveyanon.wordpress.com/](https://surveyanon.wordpress.com/)\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180619/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180619/)\n\n\\*\\*Do you benefit from transitioning?\\*\\*The case is strongest for males with autogynephilia that are involuntary celibate but other males may also benefit from it.\n\nBut if you are born female obviously you shouldn't transition no matter how bad the dysphoria or autoandrophilia is.\n\n[researchgate.net/publication/284551812\\_Impacts\\_of\\_Strong\\_Parental\\_Support\\_for\\_Trans\\_Youth](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/284551812_Impacts_of_Strong_Parental_Support_for_Trans_Youth)\n\n\\*\\*Do society benefit?\\*\\*The case for funding medical transition for males wanting to transition  is very strong. If elliot rodger had trannymaxxed 3 beautiful women  would still be alive today. You could even make the case for  transitioning some males against their will.\n\nIt would be dysgenic to require people to pay for their hormones and bottom surgery themselves.\n\nFor females wanting to transition the only potential advantage is  eugenics but it might not be worth it, on an emotional level it feels  very wrong and logically it doesn't look too good either, there are  better forms of eugenics.\n\n**Why we should support incels that go trans**\n\nBy trannymaxxing they are improving their lives and this also benefit  other people. They will be far less likely to harm women if they  transwomen and are accepted as women, treated as women.\n\nThey should be allowed inside female bathrooms once they have started on Hormone replacement therapy.\n\nIncels that dont transition are politically problematic since they might  support bad policies in a futile attempt to not die as a childless  ultimate failure. The opposite is true for incels that make the  transition, they instead benefit from hypergamy.\n\nThe purpose is to prevent incels from reproducing, they can still bank sperm or reproduce before HrT makes them infertile.\n\n**Autogynephilia and consent**\n\nAutogynephiles transitioning does not overall harm other people and  requiring consent from everyone involved in her life as a women would  make transition impossible.\n\nThe right not stop someone from engaging in a sexual activity must be  limited or it would not be possible to live a normal and good life.  Females must be allowed to show off their bodies in revealing clothing  even if it makes them aroused, gay individuals must be allowed to use  public bathrooms, you must be allowed to become sexually aroused in  public.\n\n**clero wrote**\n\nI like his ideas about polygamy, I think he's based on a lot of things, for example when it comes to free market.\n\nWhat I don't like: The purpose to increase genetic quality of mankind. I  don't like it because it's against the core principles of the  blackpill.\n\nHis own religion is pretty good, the only issue is it can't work without  an oppressive brainwashing. It's also important to rewrite history,  burn libraries and replace the word \"education\" with \"conditioning\".\n\nI think that incels are impossible to bring to that perspective, because  currently incels are demanding a girlfriend, and nazi ideologies are  common among them. Incels want a \"looksmatch\", which is pretty cucked if  you think about it. But that's the current state of inceldom.\n\n**My response**\n\nIt follows logically from the reincarnation premise that you do want to  improve humanity genetically since that will make future lives better.  If the average dick girth is increased sex will be way better.\n\nThus everyone (including incel) benefit from improving humanity and it  doesn't even mean incels will have to suffer, it only means that most  incels shouldn't reproduce naturally, you would need to use technology  or they ruin the next generation.\n\nThe main problem with incels is that they often make demands from  society that are unrealistic and that they are generally politically  problematic, this is why i have suggested physical extermination in the  past but there are other solution that could work.\n\nThe best solution is probably for truecels to feminize themselves to  they can enjoy sex with each other, that would actually solve the incel  problem but few incels are willing to actually do that, instead they  choose to remain in misery.\n\nOf course we cannot expect that males with bad genetics voluntarily  choose not to reproduce and thus is why we need to force them into dying  childless vis brutal hypergamy.\n\nMany males including ones with very strong autogynephilia will choose to  stay male just for a slim chancecor reproduction, this is probably the  #1 reason incels are not trannymaxxing to a significant degree.\n\n**Trannymaxxing pays for itself (if you dont have death sentences)**\n\nUnlike incels who waste 60k+ on worthless plastic surgeries, trannymaxxing actually pays works and pays for itself. In addition it is subsidized by the government, it may actually be completely free.\n\nTrannymaxxing is insanely legit, it completely solves all the problems incels have\n\nit solves:\n\n1. being a virgin\n2. being a neet/being poor\n3. being ugly\n4. having a beta personality\n\nIf a tranny gets breast implants, facial fem surgery, body contouring,  voice surgery, they can do sex work and pay it off in a few years. Ive  personally been offered by men to pay 100% for my transition in exchange  for a relationship (though i have no desire in transition btw).

I call myself stupid a lot, because I am, but it\u2019s different when it\u2019s coming from someone else that you\u2019re supposed to look up to and they\u2019re not joking.

Of course middle school was a horrible environment for any LGBT discovery so most of that got pressed back until late into high school where the same experimentation happened and tons of euphoria came out. That euphoria brought me around to calling myself trans. I am dysphoric, it didn't take long after the feelings of euphoria for me to realize I wasn't living to my 100%, hardly even 25%. I hadn't noticed in the background how dissatisfied I was with my gender. Anxiety and Depression hid it away, but after seeing how happy I could feel with myself I now realized how much discomfort I had with my body.\n\n\nThis is really where I'm going with this which is: I don't by any means think euphoria is on its own a qualifier for being trans, but I think it can be an early sign for many that its time to explore gender and sexuality and for us more used to being trans, not to blindly accept all euphorics and call them trans with no other option, but to help them explore where their euphoria is really stemming from.", "date": "2019-11-06 01:54:12", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/ds9ct1/views_from_an_originally_euphoric_trans/", "author": "Zoooples"}, {"title": "Well, I\u2019m truscum now...hehe..", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-11-06 03:39:43", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dsamtr/well_im_truscum_nowhehe/", "author": "XxSaaddNessSsxX"}, {"title": "Care to explain me who is this guy?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2019-11-06 08:58:56", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dsdpls/care_to_explain_me_who_is_this_guy/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "pwease refer to me as fae/faer uwu im valid", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-11-06 12:29:49", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dsfmsq/pwease_refer_to_me_as_faefaer_uwu_im_valid/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "It was funnier in my head", "text": "", "date": "2019-11-06 13:51:22", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dsgkpd/it_was_funnier_in_my_head/", "author": "damiansbeans"}, {"title": "I made a sub, r/asktransmed, without know how to really make it or mod it.

I guess it makes me feel like I should stop using the term \"gender\" altogether because we're certainly not seeing eye to eye on its meaning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI would define neurological sex or \"gender identity\" as: The biological sex of the body that the brain expects to reside in.\n\nThat's it. No more, no less. Everything else (names, pronouns, hairstyles, clothing, expectations of masculine/feminine behavior, etc.) breaks down into social constructs and cannot be part of this innate, biological condition. Of course, I still believe those things have importance, but that importance is only because they are entangled in a complex web of associations, so the long term process of associating things like pronouns and certain names with a given biological sex causes them to trigger dysphoria because they are so fundamentally associated with that sex. The only reason I care about male pronouns is because I associate them with being physically male (and besides, in my other language, \"he\" is the female pronoun, so it's clearly not the pronouns themselves). \n\nI know the community likes to pretend sex is a social construct too, but I think this is ridiculous - the existence of intersex conditions that fall outside the sex binary does not mean that sex is a continuum or construct, as there is a fixed number of intersex conditions and they cannot be infinitely combined (e.g. Klinefelter Syndrome can only occur in males, Turner Syndrome can only occur in females, etc.)  \n\n\nHowever, it seems like the mainstream community now has the exact opposite idea about it. They seem to think gender identity is simply the gender roll you wish to occupy and that dysphoria is socially constructed and caused by society telling you there's \"only one right way to be a man/woman.\" This leads to utterly bizarre claims such as \"the only requirement for being a man/woman is wanting to be one!\" and \"well you're male so your vagina is male too!/well you're female so your penis is female too!\" These claims are completely nonsensical to me, since the only thing that makes me male is the fact that my brain expects a penis, flat chest, low voice, etc.   \n\n\nIt seems like it used to be that everyone in the community understood that this was just something you were born with and that it wasn't a choice, but now I literally hear people say \"don't say it's not a choice, that's invalidating to people who experience their gender as a choice!\" And I just think, what the fuck happened? I leave for 7 years and I come back and it's like the entire community has gone insane - it's been taken over.   \n\n\nIt's very upsetting to me, because when I first came out 15 years ago, every cis person I talked to believed that it was a choice, that being trans was just \"wanting to be a man/woman.\" I spent so much effort explaining to everyone that it wasn't a choice, that dysphoria was innate and could only be cured by transition (none of them had ever heard of dysphoria before), and that this wasn't just some sort of \"would you rather\" type scenario but an actual medical condition you were born with. Once people I talked to understood it was just medical and not a choice, they actually became accepting - it's the only method I found was reliable for actually changing people's minds.   \n\n\nNow it seems like the trans community has betrayed that and is trying to convince everyone that it's not \"born this way\" after all and it is all a choice and societal phenomenon instead. I hate to use the word \"valid\" because it's been rendered so meaningless, but I honestly can't think of anything more invalidating than the idea that being trans is just a choice or \"preference\" akin to the decision to dye your hair or get a tattoo or something.   \n\n\ntl;dr: It seems like the community definition of \"gender identity\" has strayed so much over time that it's become meaningless. I believe it should be defined as \"the biological sex of the body that the brain expects to reside in,\" because that's the only piece that's innate, everything else is by association.", "date": "2019-11-06 20:46:46", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/dsma7e/defining_gender_identityneurological_sex/", "author": "benstransaccount"}, {"title": "This really shows how fucking one-sided r/traaa is.

I feel a sense of comfort and euphoria when being referred to as a man and being seen as one. So of course I want top. Of course I want T. I want to live as a male as much as I can.\n\nBut looking into medical consequences... it\u2019s fucking terrifying. There\u2019s unknown side effects, uterine/ovarian atrophy, and majorly increased risk of heart disease. And, if you want to avoid atrophy and other problems by getting a hysterectomy (which seems to become nearly mandatory at a point), there\u2019s hundreds of side effects that could be brought on by that. I\u2019ve found out that, after a hysto, women have over 100% increased risk of dementia, along with extreme risks of osteoporosis, Parkinson\u2019s, CAD, and nearly all cancers. No one knows, from my knowledge, if taking t prevents any of this whatsoever. And all of this is only scratching the surface of health issues.\n\nI\u2019m young. 17 to be exact. If I start taking t within the next few years, by the time I reach my twenties I\u2019m going to likely have to deal with the problems of a 50 year old. And god knows what the fuck else. I\u2019m healthy right now, and I\u2019m so scared to sacrifice that. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t have good access to therapy (can only go once every couple months) and the only gender clinic near me that could answer my questions is clogged up for months, so I have no professionals to talk to. For now I\u2019m basically left with the decision to fuck up my physical health completely and possibly die or suffer medical problems pretty young, or suffer through my life with horrible dysphoria and likely kill myself while I\u2019m still young. Either way I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I ended up offing myself, because who knows if I\u2019ll find a place where I\u2019m fully accepted even if I manage to be healthy after transition.\n\nNeedless to say, anyone who does this for the hell of it and doesn\u2019t have gender dysphoria is a fucking idiot.

My name is Jake, and I\u2019ve been out as trans for two years.\n\nI have dysphoria and I firmly believe dysphoria is required to be trans. I do my best to be accepting when people make mistakes, I have a supportive community, and I\u2019m planning on getting top surgery soon. This is especially great because my chest is my biggest source of dysphoria and also my biggest \u201cgiveaway\u201d as someone trying to stealth.\n\nThrough all this, I still have fears and doubts that I\u2019m not \u201cactually dysphoric\u201d. I have days where I look down at my chest and I don\u2019t feel that pang of self-loathing. I feel mostly apathetic towards my body now, and I\u2019m afraid it means I\u2019m not really trans.\n\nThere\u2019s a little voice in the back of my mind saying \u201cwhat if you\u2019re just a masculine woman? What if you\u2019re a repressed butch lesbian??\u201d and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s dysphoria talking or something else.

How to approach health (professionals)?", "text": "Hi, sorry this is a very very long post, tried to format as well as I could. If any of you actually read it, thank you.\n\nCame here because I feel like this sub would give more rational advice. I can't fking stop thinking about this, keeps me up at night. Wondering if I'd be happier transitioning and presenting neutral or feminine, or if that won't fix anything.... have no idea how to find knowledgeable and qualified health professionals, but so desperate to do something and I constantly feel like I'm running out of time.\n\nI recently turned 18, AMAB and asexual. I've been \"questioning\" since 15-16. My friends could tell (before I could) that I wasn't straight, as early as middle school, when I had zero interest in dating and no masculine traits. I still can't tell if this is because asexuality + anxiety, or dysphoria. I can identify which thoughts are obsessive and which ones aren't, just not *why*. I have no idea how much extends beyond personal identity (social dysphoria), and if it would change if I presented differently?? \n\nBecause of my depression (family situation and cross-country move), I went to so many therapists. It's incredible that none of them diagnosed me with depression or OCD, just \"general anxiety.\" Looking back this makes me so, so mad. \n\nAs a child, I was blissfully unaware about gender... until I was introduced to the idea of puberty... when that started, my depression only got worse. My view on puberty was very anatomical, and I felt hopeful, yet helpless. I have no idea what would have happened if I'd known about asexuality or transition earlier...  what would I identify as now?? None of this has anything to do with how other people see me!!! \n\nRegardless of being trans:\n\n* My name never suited me, so I'm changing it. New name is neutral (slightly feminine), but nobody has questioned it.\n* I'm going to get my facial hair removed. I have Asian genes, so any hair I grow looks gross, and shaving makes me break out.\n* I hate men's fashion. It doesn't look good to me, and I wish there was more overlap between women's/men's clothing. I dress as a minimalist would.\n\nThoughts on my body:\n\n* My genitals are a nuisance and I really hate it, also it feels painful/gross. Again I couldn't care less about sex. I constantly feel like I need to change something, I just don't know how/why. Years and years into all this, when I expected all this worry to go away, it hasn't. My libido feels so unnatural and forced and has no place in my life and I want to fking get rid of it, even bought flaxseed and shit.\n* I've been shaving my body since I started growing hair. I was very scared for that to start, but fortunately it's manageable. Still grosses me out.\n* I hate my voice (and my Adam's apple). It's throaty, uncomfortable, and loud. I speak quietly and I'm sometimes scared of talking on the phone.\n* I so badly wish I never grew so much. Knowing that I could grow more in my 20s gives me breakdowns, it's one of my biggest fears. I'm not even that tall but I really feel it, everyone seems to have a reason to mention my f**\\*\\*** height.\n\nI don't want to talk about any of these traits as being masculine or feminine, because I can't tell if that's the cause.\n\nOther than this, anxiety, and university stress, my mental health is okay, and my OCD is very manageable because I've developed self-awareness. \n\nHow in the world am I supposed to explain this to a doctor/therapist? How am I supposed to try and present differently? I brought up a tiny bit with my psych nurse (hardly anything), and she suggested to go to a local gender specialist (actually an OBGYN). I would have gone if I didn't switch universities this year. I feel like fewer doctors are informed about asexuality than trans issues, but mentioning any of this in general seems really scary, it's hard to find trust.

See, the reason I always didnt like NB's was because I thought they were all SJW tucute snowflakes that said they were NB for attention/oppression points. Then after I found this sub plus some other forums on other sights, I slowly but surely found out theres alot of NB's that are truscum/logical and that they disagree with the whole \"NB is a third gender\" or \"deconstruct society into a genderless world\" type thinking alot of the mainstream \"trans\" media is currently doing. I now realize there are NB's that truly have dysphoria and do not see themselves as on the binary. And I'm sorry for doubting you. I was wrong and unfair and the last thing I wanna do is become a fact-ignoring, bigoted, conservative, binge-watching Fox News transphobe. I admit sometimes I go off too much and that's because I'm sick and tired of trans being perceived as some kinda fashion/political statement when its *VERY* much not. Or having to be compared to a non-dysphoric \"trans\" person that all they did was wear a dress/suit and cut their hair and say their trans and people thinking I'm the same as that.

You dont even hear enby jokes. Its always transwomen.  Terfs seem to be specifically laser focused on trans women, while just being somewhat condescending to ftm and nb.  Whenever theres trans murders it is almost always mtf.  We seem to annoy our own community, like traa complaining about too many mtf posts, or enbies and gnc complaining about mtfs trying to pass and actively working against our wishes even in simple things like wanting to be assumed female pronouns up to getting medical coverage. \n\nFuck, Trans women talking about our dysphoria is now a non-pc topic. And finally cis people, we seem to come to mind as the de-facto posterchildren for being trans but that comes with so many bad things.  The visibility makes it harder to pass when its already incredibly difficult as amab to pass as female.  The stupid sports debate is always about mtfs.  The bathroom debate seems to always be more about womens restrooms that worrying about trans men. The shelter debate seems exclusive to trans women.\n\n Not to mention this is on top of that fact that we have the hardest time transitioning:\nThe most expensive surguries (yes ftm bottom costs more, but yet most insurance cover both bottom and top surgury for men but only bottom for women.  And forget about ffs if you dont make 100k+ a year despite the fact its integral to passing, and this is on top of shit both ftm and mtf have to pay for. Our hormones dont do shit compared to t, it doesnt change your voice, it doesnt change your facial hair, it doesnt add to bone mass, breasts are hit or miss and best of all nothing is permanenet until bottom surgury.

While I'm not particularly kinky myself (by my city's standards I'm a goddamn prude), I do see being against it as quite a socially conservative trait.

I do not want to be a \"part of\" the 'truscum' community. Not because I don't enjoy being here, but because it is exceptionally alienating and becoming increasingly targeted by delusional people. I don't get it. How can anyone argue that dysphoria is not required to be transgender? What is their justification for transitioning? \"I simply want to\" is nonsensical. If you didn't have a personal need to transition then you wouldn't. That need itself is a part of dysphoria. Dysphoria is a complex symptom and it isn't just finding yourself at odds with your birth sex, it ecompasses HOW that impacts a person. Something is leading you to want to transition. You can't tell me it doesn't lead to discomfort not having transitioned. How is that possible? I can't understand why a person would abruptly change their gender on a whim. Every emotional response has a cause. People cry when they are hurt, people laugh when things are funny, people pursue life altering changes because they experience discomfort.\n\nIs it possible that a lot of these deniers just don't experience a strong dysphoria, so they've interpreted it as nonexistent and are now convinced it isn't a requirement? Maybe. It seems there's a loud crowd of obnoxious fetishists though and people who are compelled to label themselves due to social pressure. \n\nI'm exhausted, really. \n\nAgain, what is the justification to transition? Where does the desire originate if not from a level of discomfort?

Let's get that out of the way.\n\nNow, moving forward, I've noticed a lot of bizarre trends among trans communities on Reddit and eleswhere, as has my girlfriend (23/MtF). It boils down mainly to a lot of hostility and *wayyyyy* too much sexuality, which I'll get to later.\n\nTo just give a quick overview of some things here, my girlfriend was very openly trans on a forum we frequented (we met there lmfao), back when being trans was basically painting a target on your back for doxxing and harassment, and she was at the forefront of enabling the formation of a trans community.\n\nI, on the other hand, was participating in the existing Gay community on the forum, as once again, being gay wasn't as taboo as being trans, and as a result, the \"Gay Chat\" (as we'll use from here on out) had way more members and a much more diverse crowd. Of course, I didn't join the Trans group because I was in deep, deep denial and also there were some people in that group who had personal issues with me, god knows why.\n\nMoving forward though, the idea of transgender/transexual people became less and less of a \"bad thing\" on the forum, and so people were able to be more open about being trans and stuff. My girlfriend was happy to see that, and opened the door to help these people.\n\nAlmost *overnight*, the threads/steam chats (and now discords) became chock full of trenders, tucutes and other such folks. Discussions regarding seeking medication, where to go for therapy, and ways to come out, became replaced with \"look at my socks!\" and \"I can do a twirl uwu\", and lots and **LOTS** of really uncomfortable sex talk. Like, \"look at my girldick owo\" shit. Trying to vent about issues, or seek emotional support for trauma turned into oppression olympics of people trying to one-up each other on how awful things are. The final straw for my girlfriend was when, after a long on-off hiatus without her there, the community rebranded itself to CDTG. \"Crossdressing and Transgender\".\n\nMeanwhile, once again, the \"Gay Chat\" has been pretty smooth, as people there are gay, lesbian or bisexual. The folks there play video games, chat about everyday stuff, and drama is kept to a minimum. There are a number of MtF and FtM people present there, who are also just part of the community because we don't ask for special treatment or attention, but just to be part of something that isn't the \"CDTG\".\n\nWeird rant aside, I've noticed this to be the case with other friends of mine.

My experiences are vastly different than someone who has no dysphoria and identifies as whatever they wish to identify when they feel like it. Just call yourself GNC and stop latching yourself on to the trans label, please. Like, you're not really trans if your \"transness\" begins and ends at merely identifying as something. This is appropriating and making a mockery of a serious medical condition that many struggle with. It's comparable to stolen valor in a way. There are people in the military who are brave as fuck, who risk their lives and everything defending their country, and then you have some appropriating knob who puts on a military costume and claims to be the same as them.\n\nWhat's worse is that you are apparently 'bigoted' and 'transphobic' if you don't agree with the premise that every single one of these gender identities are valid, and that everyone is trans just if they say they identify as trans. Just the other day I made a post on asktra about TERFs, and a couple of individuals snooped through my profile history and called me out because I was active in [r/truscum](https://www.reddit.com/r/truscum/). So without me sharing any of my truscum beliefs beforehand, I was compared with TERFs, and later they went onto calling me a bigoted transphobe when I defended myself.\n\nI just don't understand how they can compare me with a TERF. TERFs don't believe in the science of gender, so when they try to make sense of transness they figure it's probably some fetish we get off on, or it's because of the patriarchy and sexism in our society. TERFs want to take away trans peoples rights, which is infinitely worse than not believing that X amount of made up genders are biologically possible, and that you need gender dysphoria to be trans.\n\nIt's just so frustrating to me that trans spaces have been taken over and colonized by trenders, GNC folk, and people who are high as fuck up in the clouds about their unscientific make believe beliefs.

Gender is a word that in my opinion, has kind of lost its meaning because everyone defines it differently similarly to how everyone has different views on what constitutes as communism. But I do heavily agree that gender as in gender roles and stereotypes are a social construct that have only very little basis in biology. It bugs me to no end when people worry about, let's say their son (always the boys) playing with dolls or wearing a dress because he likes the feel of the fabric or something, and make assumptions about him being trans or gay when he's literally just exploring the world. But it *also* bothers me when teenagers or adults claim that expressing themselves in a way that isn't 100 % masculine or 100 % feminine makes them nonbinary because *obviously* a woman always has to be feminine and like every single thing about womanhood. It's almost insulting in a way because I would've thought we as a society were more progressive than that.\n\nBut it's no surprise. Once you take body dysphoria away, what is left of being trans is pretty much just gender roles and words that have lost their meaning. Obviously, there is absolutely nothing wrong with being a crossdresser or wanting to appear more androgynous. But I do wonder how many of those men who crossdress realize that \"being a women\" isn't about wearing dresses everyday, putting on make-up, being treated \"like a lady\" or anything that is in my opinion more of an idealized fairytale version of womanhood. There are plently of masculine (as defined by society) women who don't like any of those things. And the same goes for men. \n\nI feel like aside from people on tumblr, there is a huge problem with people feeling like they absolutely *must* be another gender because society's boxes for what is acceptable are so narrow that no one can really fit them. Combine that with issues like toxic masculinity and it gets worse. The rhetoric that \"everyone can be trans if they identify that way\" and egg culture doesn't help at all. I feel like it often leads to enforcing even stricter gender roles and confusing people who feel alienated for not fitting in in the first place.\n\nLet's say you're a guy who likes stereotypically feminine things. Not exactly accepted by society but something that exists. I can't imagine it being helpful to be grouped in with people who either think they are trans women or actually are when that's basically implying trans women are men in dresses and men can never like feminine things and...stay men because they're comfortable with the body parts they have. Like, *what?*\n\nIf you ask me, instead of claiming that everyone or a huge proportion of people are trans if they have \"social dysphoria\" (without body dysphoria so they simply hate being treated a certain way) we should go back to breaking up gender roles, celebrate diversity instead of demonizing it, and insist that there are multiple ways to be a man or woman, trans people included. Because why should a trans man or trans woman be expected to reject everything feminine or masculine when a lot of that is just society being needlessly restrictive? I know there's the passing issue with pre-transition trans people but other than that, things like clothes, hairstyle, colors, hobbies etc. shouldn't really *have* a gender if you ask me.\n\nWhat about you?

The person in question would present male ~4 out of 5 days of the week, but wear fetishy femme clothes on the other days. Apparently they were always touching everyone and being overtly aggressive when people told them to stop.\n\nShe told me that she was having a hard time keeping me dissociated with her new coworker since we were both trans. And thats why she was comfortable being as touchy or close with me sometimes.\n\nI mentioned that i was sorry this person was making her uncomfortable and that she should definitely know that shes right to be uncomfortable by it, etc. But also that i was a bit hurt by her letting this affect how she sees me.\n\nHer behavior got more and more distant with me over the year up until today when she accidentally (at least i hope) outed me to a whole group of people, who are mutual friends. I tried to cover it up and I might have been successful with some but not all. Im going to try to talk 1 on 1 with everyone and see if they mention something to me - maybe i can shut it down.\n\nThis is a big deal to me. Im stealth and have been for ~7 years. Now im sure it will spread to whole bunch of people eventually, and i basically am going to have to either get a new social circle in town somehow or move to a different city.\n\nAnyways i confronted my friend about it when we got back to her place. She told me its not a big deal since apparently trans people like being out. And then said something that hurt me profoundly - \"youre just a man with a fetish, whats the big deal if people know the truth\".\n\nI left and have been crying for most of the day. That friendship is over. I just question how she could conflate me with her coworker and let that color her view on me and most trans people.\n\nThis is someone who even prior to my transition treated me like one of the gals and when i came out to her she was happy for me and told me it made sense to her. Someone who for ~6 years didnt make a mistake on my pronouns once or say anything even remotely transphobic.\n\nAnd you know maybe im missing some crucial piece of information (maybe she got a new friend who was a terf or something idk). But im sad and angry and i feel resentful to her coworker for ruining our friendship.\n\n/End vent (sorry it got long)\n\n----------------------------\n\nEdit: Thanks for the responses and encouragement everyone! The people she outed me to did end up telling a few people and its been hell for a bit. But it didnt spread as far as i thought it would and ive started to make plans to leave this city soon.

Sometimes I notice I am growing more masculine, other times I feel very femme. Like I can \"see\" the \"girl\" that is still \"inside\" of me.\n\nAbout a week ago I'd been staring at myself in the mirror (as one does haha) and I just kind of said fuck it, and, out of curiosity, dressed up. My hair is long enough to put in a bun so I did that. Then I found an old bra of mine and put that on too. \n\nI did not...like it. It made me uncomfortable. But, objectively speaking, I looked fine. I knew this and acknowledged it. At the risk of sounding narcissistic I'd make a hot girl. I took all of it off though, let my hair down, put my Black Sabbath t-shirt back on and felt loads better. \n\nEver since I've been contemplating how I'd look as a girl... Thinking a thousand what-ifs, etc. I think it's really hitting me that I am \"becoming\" a man. I think I finally realized that being a girl was never a possibility for me and I'm closing that door forever. All the imagining I did as a preteen before I knew I was trans, this \"fantasy\" girl I built up in my head, she's gone and in fact she never existed. \n\nIt's making me really sad. I'm not sure why. It's not like I want to be a girl. Maybe I am just mourning what I initially expected of myself and what others expected of me...

They made a comment about toxic communities, like TERFS, and also the other side being transmedicalists. So I was like, ok maybe you're like every other person who just blocks their ears, looks away and goes LALALALA when a transmedicalist is speaking, but, what if, WHAT IF, you're not? \"Even though I have a bad feeling about this, and that there's gonna be other angry people, I'm just gonna take the shot, and ask, if you have a genuine reason why you think they're toxic.\" Is what I thought\n\nAnd so I did, I asked, I tried to be as polite as possible, stating that I was genuinely curious and that I think they're often misunderstood and not given a chance to really speak on their stance, but that I still wanted to know what this specific person thought. I didn't think I was targeting them, I was simply stating what the majority of non truscum seem to do.

And I dunno, I couldn't even understand half of what she said because it was so poorly constructed, which basically screamed TRIGGERED to me. \n\nIt just really sucks because it's so disappointing. I just wish I could see at least ONE person, who actually knows the beliefs of truscum, tell me why they think we're toxic, or why they believe differently in a MATURE way. To each their own if they have a different opinion which is totally ok, but don't base it off assumptions.\n\nI even replied to this person once more, saying that I didn't mean any harm in what I was asking, and that I wasn't trying to target them individually. I dunno, I think I was being quite logical and calm in my comments, even though what she said annoyed me in that she obviously was very very quick to judge and take offence.\n\nI just had to write this here, because it honestly just makes me really sad to see people like that who are so closed minded towards anything that isn't their own thoughts, and can't have a mature discussion.", "date": "2019-12-04 14:55:22", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/e60d9l/not_allowed_to_ask_questions/", "author": "lilsparrow18"}, {"title": "[Discussion] Do you feel it's possible to completely happy as a trans person?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2019-12-04 18:53:40", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/e63ubh/discussion_do_you_feel_its_possible_to_completely/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "ban me idc, but why is this transphobe allowed on here?

I refused to dress feminine or own anything pink, had mostly guy friends, disliked my feminine name, and prided myself on being the strongest and tallest in the class. Soon enough I learned what my reproductive organs were for, I was disgusted. I couldn\u2019t use tampons for a very long time because my body would tense up so much and I would have an anxiety attack. My internal dysphoria also led to me hating being around children and led to me making the decision that I never want kids ever.  Every time being pregnant was brought up I would have an anxiety attack. My female family members had attempted to put makeup on me and I hated it. I once went to Ulta with my mom and had makeup put on me, then sobbed when we got home because it made me uncomfortable. \n\nOnce I started going through puberty and growing breasts, it was always really uncomfortable. For years and years something felt wrong with my chest, it felt weird and I didn\u2019t know why. I felt very disconnected from my chest. I just decided to always wear loose clothes and brush it off, because I do have anxiety, ocd and depression so I didn\u2019t have space in my head to deal with this uncomfortable feeling. Plus, I got a lot of attention for my very curvy female appearance, so I was like, \u201cOh everyone else thinks I\u2019m pretty! So I don\u2019t need to worry about how I look or how I feel about my looks!\u201d I tried to have a romantic encounter that uh,,, *involved my boobs* and I had an anxiety attack. We took it slow and tried again later, and I was able to fight off the bad uncomfortable feeling enough to let it happen. Every time my chest would get involved, I would feel weird, but it also felt nice so I ignored it. In late middle school I started to experiment more with makeup and I discovered I\u2019m pretty good at it, and it made me look prettier to others, so I did it more often and I liked the colors. I enjoyed the occasional dress, but the big focus was always the flowy aspect, I never really had a low cut dress that showed cleavage. \n\nBeing more involved in the LGBT community after I figured out I was Bisexual, I came across some YouTube videos on gender dysphoria. When chest dysphoria was brought up, I related to it a lot. It felt like someone had put a name to the feeling I was experiencing. I hadn\u2019t really labeled myself as anything, I just knew I was feeling chest dysphoria so I asked my parents for a binder. Of course they had questions, and answering these questions led me to think I may be trans. I talked with my therapist about it and labeled myself as genderfluid. After obsessing about it for awhile (due to my ocd nature, I obsess about most things) I decided that being a guy felt better. \n\nOver the past year I\u2019ve socially transitioned, changed my name, been in an outpatient facility to deal with my mental health, and I was doing pretty good. I also realized that I did want kids, I just didn\u2019t want to be pregnant myself. I actually love the idea of being a dad. I was thinking that I could get top surgery soon because of how well I\u2019d been doing in outpatient and how my chest dysphoria was preventing me from doing things like working out, going out in public or to school, and because my chest is large my binder was especially difficult and painful. I soon realized, despite the support of my therapists and peers, my parents weren\u2019t so sure about top surgery. I understood where they\u2019re coming from, but my dysphoria was so crippling, and my metal health had been so much better, I feel like I had thought about it enough and realized I\u2019ve been a guy since childhood. \n\nRealizing I wasn\u2019t getting top surgery any time soon, my mental health plummeted very fast. I fell back into depression and had gained a lot of weight because of various medication, which made me feel even worse about myself (I\u2019ve always been an athlete until a few years ago, so all I knew was skinny, I\u2019d never been overweight before). It was so difficult for me to go to school every day, I decided to move to online school. It\u2019s been about 5 months since I got out of outpatient and then fell back into depression. Since then, I\u2019ve been to a gender therapist who said I may not be trans because I said I \u201cdon\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be enough of a guy\u201d. That of course made me doubt myself even more. This highly trained professional said I might not be trans, so maybe I\u2019m not? She referred me to an OCD specialist. The OCD specialist went through some exposure therapy with me for the doubt and fear of not being trans, which made me stress about it less. Sometimes though it feels like I\u2019m never 100% certain about anything ever, I always feel doubt even about simple choices. \n\nThe past 2-3 months I\u2019ve really been struggling. I don\u2019t know who to get honest answers from. I wonder if I\u2019m trans because I still like makeup and have been wanting to try wearing some more feminine clothes (I haven\u2019t since I started transitioning a year ago). I haven\u2019t done those things for fear of looking like a girl and not passing at all and/or LIKING the fact that I look like a girl and then realizing I\u2019m not trans. I also don\u2019t desire phalloplasty, because dicks are gross to me, and I\u2019m used to the genitals I have (plus no one has to see what I have down there) and I wonder if I\u2019m not trans because of that. I still feel depressed when I think about how I could never have penis+vagina sex with a girl (where I\u2019m the one with the penis) or get a boner or pee standing up without an STP. I\u2019m trying to work out in a class with my mom, wearing a tight sports bra and loose hoodie with the sleeves cut off, but I still am constantly dysphoric. Sometimes I see pictures of how I used to look, I was so much more attractive, and I feel like such an ugly boy. I miss being attractive and desirable (maybe that\u2019s why I want to try wearing more feminine clothes?). It feels like being accepted in society as a man is unattainable, and I\u2019m never gonna feel happy about myself. I\u2019ll always have XX chromosomes and some female characteristics I can\u2019t change. Sometimes I even think about the fact that if scientists ever found my skeleton they\u2019d label me as a girl, and that makes me anxious af. I just keep finding all these little things that make me wonder if I\u2019m really trans, and if I should really be working towards medical transition. I\u2019ve never been at such a low point. I live in constant dysphoria and also constant fear that I may not be trans anyway. It\u2019s a painful existence. \n\nTL;DR- been dysphoric since I was a kid, but certain things make me question if I\u2019m trans.

I started hormones in my early teens. Because of this I pass pretty well and was mostly stealth and pretty unconcerned with the trans community for quite a long time as I felt it wasn't really beneficial to me anymore. Over the last few years I've become more  agitated with the current mainstream trans community as I feel my voice as a binary trans person has been stifled by the hyperwoke identity politics pervasive in most trans spaces. \n\nSomething in particular that has been bothering me lately is the notion that gender is a social construct.\n\nI've always been somebody who puts great stock in empiricism and the methods of science, so therefore my conception of what it means to be trans has always been centered around the biological basis of trans identity. This was integral in me accepting myself as a young teen. Today I had an extremely unpleasant interaction on FB where I responded to somebody claiming that gender is a social construct. I personally have a hard time believing this as it seems to insinuate that being transgender is a choice, which comes off to me as demeaning and transphobic. How could my debilitating dysphoria possibly have been something that I chose? Doesn't gender being a social construct kind of imply that I could of just been happy female, since gender is a social phenomena that doesn't matter anyway? I basically said this and got bombarded with a bunch of \"trans\" people basically telling me that gender IS a social construct and I am the way I am because of society. This was very disturbing to hear and made me extremely dysphoric. I tried to explain to them the research I have done that seems to point towards the opposite being true. After which I was given a link to a facebook group called \"Understanding Cissexism and Transphobia\" which I was encouraged to join because I am apparently transphobic. This came across as incredibly condescending and I am honestly still quite upset about it. \n\nI feel incredibly alone in the world right now with everything going on in the trans sphere, and figured some people on this sub might have some kind words or advice on how to deal with these kinds of people.

I've been out as male since 2017 and I started hormones in February last year. \n\nMy family, mostly my mom, brother, and grandma, still have problems misgendering me.

It doesn't help that it costs like 50 or 60 bucks each time we need a refill.\n\nIf I tell my family how I feel, they tell me not to worry about it because I can't do anything about it.

I honestly think they have the wrong idea about trans people because they're feminazis (sorry if you're a feminist but they're beliefs are NOT healthy in the slightest) and their friend transitioned  (I believe) due to trauma and not actual GD. But I have no idea. He seems happy, he had a kid. Idk let people live their lives?? \n\nMy problem is I'm really scared of them starting up a conversation about LGBT+ stuff. And being in that acronym, and having trans friends these anti LGBT rants make me especially uncomfortable. But I'm the only one in my immediate family that thinks this way. Luckily my mom is more understanding, she would never dead name my friends or use the wrong pronouns on purpose. \n\nIdk if it's weird for someone who's just an allie to be so passionate about these issues but I'll explain why I am. Honestly I used to be anti LGBT until I A. Discovered my sexuality and B. Was hospitalized for internalized homophobia (basically). During my outpatient program I met trans people, I was nervous. I was scared of them. That they're gonna use my bathroom and assault me. But after hearing their stories of some really triggering stories about living with GD, feeling suicidal, hating yourself. Seeing this poor guy cry his heart out because his family doesn't support him. That honestly changed me. I could somewhat empathize. And if transitioning is the best thing to help them then I saw no harm. Many trans people just feel so much better living as the opposite gender. And I was happy for them. I made friends with two MTF people my senior year of high school. I would defend them when other students made fun of them. I would stand near the bathroom in case something happened. I had heard stories of trans people getting beat up and I didn't want that happening. So yea. Studying psychology, and having these experiences I'm proudly no longer transphobic and love my trans peeps to the fullest. \n\nSo when my family starts talking about \"THE EVIL TRAN****\" I want to leave and just cry. But I'm gonna be stuck in my sisters apartment for a few days so Idk what to do if something like that comes up. Or even talking about gay people. Just stay silent and cringe??? Especially because they're older they think they know everything. (This goes for extended family as well). My 'aunt' (not really my aunt) said she's had cases of trans people assaulting women in bathrooms. I knew she wouldn't listen to reason, I don't even remember what I did. But I might end up punching someone in the face this Christmas. \n\nSorry. I just didn't know who else to tell this too because I have no idea what will happen in other subreddits if I mention gender dysphoria.

They'll say not to assume gender based on appearance, but then tell their cis male friends that they're \"eggs\" because they wear makeup. Even people who view society with the most basic, traditional gender roles, wouldn't assume that a dude is MtF because he likes makeup. But they'll also say that pre-T trans men can absolutely wear dresses, have long hair, have their chests out, generally appear 100% female, but still be male and should be seen as such by strangers. That completely contradicts their belief that anyone who is slightly nonconforming to their gender, is the opposite.\n\nIt makes me believe that these types of people just want EVERYONE to be trans. Surely if a cis male wearing makeup makes him female, then a trans guy appearing entirely female, would be going against male stereotypes and therefore he would also be female in your eyes? Why does it only count when the person in your scenario would be revealed as trans rather than cis? Because they just want more trans people. How else would it be that the slightly GNC cis man is trans, but the completely GNC trans man is also trans??\n\nThis is people's lives we're talking about. If you somehow convince someone they're trans when they're not, for your own warped benefit, you're disgusting. Don't get me wrong, it can be good to have trans people in your life to talk to, but not if they're actually cis. Plus, you shouldn't be wishing it on anyone, it sucks. Gender is a complicated thing when you think about it, especially if you don't have dysphoria and so you don't know what it feels like, so genuinely start to question everything. If I was cis in this society, I'd probably be questioning the tiniest things about myself. You can probably convince a cis person that they're trans, send them up a path of transition, and their only hope is to figure things out before they mess up their lives and actually develop dysphoria. And if you have dysphoria and still do this, knowing it'll be partially your fault if they develop it, that's even worse. You know how it feels. Taking someone who would've never had dysphoria if it wasn't for you, then causing them to develop it, is horrific.\n\nObviously people aren't idiots, most people won't start believing that they're trans just because someone told them. But it happens, some people are really susceptible to it. Especially if you have multiple people telling you you might be trans. Look at Trevor Moran. He's a pretty feminine dude, and after he came out as gay, people started telling him he could be trans. He probably thought \"Huh.. I am really feminine, maybe I'm trans?\" and I think he might've actually come out as trans for a while,but he realised he wasn't. Some people aren't so lucky or they jump into transition before they can figure it out.

You've just misgendered me again in a trans space when I asked you not to. That's super shitty\n\nHonestly about the gendered language, grow up.

Moreover, while I do not think that gender itself real, representations of gender exist everywhere in the way we individually 'do' gender.\n\nIt is very real. Studies have show that male brains and female brains act differently. It is shown in animals as well.\n\nhttps://stanmed.stanford.edu/2017spring/how-mens-and-womens-brains-are-different.html\n\nIn this article from Stanford, it shows facinating evidence that shows the survival tactics our brains make.

Even if I was reducing it to a feeling, I don't think that does anything invalidate the trans experience, feelings are super important, dysphoria (if you want to play that game) is a feeling, as is depression. That doesn't mean they are any less valid\n\nAgain, contridicting points. And that depression statement? Depression is not just a fucking feeling. It is a chemical imbalance in the brain. Depression is when the brain releases dopamine (or happy juice) however it gets sucked back in immediately. As someone who suffers strongly from depression, its not just a fucking feeling.\n&gt;\nI'm not saying gender is a feeling because I don't think that's a consequence of rejecting thisbidea of a \"true self\" and an \"innate gender\".

His distinction, based on a few small studies, goes as follows.\n\nHSTS are homosexual (as in, they like people of sex that they were born in sexually) and typically have physical, mental, and personality traits that align more with the opposite gender before hormones and benefit greatly from cross sex transition as they have issues identifying with and fitting in to the role of their natal sex. HSTS also typically pass a lot easier due to feminized or masculinized physical features that are a product of the same process that mentally feminized or masculinized them mentally.\n\nAGPs (autogynephiles and their female counterpart) on the other hand are individuals attracted to the opposite sex who develop a sexual attachment to themselves as the opposite gender and actively get off to their own image and the idea that they are the opposite sex. Autogynephilia is not sexual inversion and is typically accompanied by other co-morbidityslike narcissistic personality disorder or multiple personality disorder in which the person develops a seperate personality to the straight cis personality that believes itself and attempts to act like the other sex and is also innately attracted to itself. Autogynephiles (in males) typically tend to pass a lot less due to their normally masculinized features that lack the feminized features (like shorter on average hieght, baby face, and lack of other adult masculine developments) that hsts naturally posses.\n\nWhile Im aware Blanchard theories need lots of expanding on, more nuanced and current studies of these two groups, and better terminology (as many hsts fail to identify with the homosexual label but nonetheless fall into the type) I believe the Blanchard typology is still a more or less accurate model for two types of transexual that can be found and the clear distinctions between them.

It wasn't anything she was consumed over though. I didn't even know of it until we started discussing her possible transness. I believe that this experience is a valid part of some people's experiences, and can be chalked up to a desire to be the other gender sexually. It's similar to how I would imagine myself as the guy when watching porn, it's just manifested differently in her. I also believe nonbinary is a valid gender identity.

This is why people are hesitant to support trans people. Hell, eventually medical transitioning won't be covered by insurance. Why? Because so many people are trying to say \"you don't need dysphoria to be trans\" and shit. If we don't have medical reasons to transition, what reason is there for insurance companies to help us?\n\n\"But saying trans people have a mental illness is mean!\"\n\nNo. Stigmatizing mental health issues is, of course, a problem, but the solution is *not* to demedicalize dysphoria. Additionally, when people say there \"aren't any medical reasons that people are trans\" that means it is a *choice*. And it isn't. It is not a choice to be trans, nor is it a choice to be dysphoric. This is why people who *aren't* trans think that people can just \"stop being trans if they try hard enough.\" I'm honestly in fear of what the future may look like.\n\n**ALRIGHT HERE COMES THE MORE PERSONAL PART OF MY RANT**\n\nPeople are constantly appropriating trans identities, especially non-binary identities. I'm non-binary, and I see other \"non-binary\" people talk about how \"fun\" and \"cool\" their gender is and how much they \"love\" their gender. I mean... I can't fathom feeling that way. I would *KILL* (myself, probably) to be cis, or even just trans-binary. Anything but non-binary. I don't have anything against actual non-binary people. I just don't like living it. I don't want to wake up in the morning and have a panic attack because of my chest tissue. I don't want to keep getting dehumanized and called an \"attack helicopter\" just because of my gender. I'm tired of nobody taking me seriously. I'm tired of hating my body and not having *any* power to change it. I'm tired of not being able to talk about these feelings. I'm tired of hurting myself.\n\nDon't bother giving me a hotline; I won't have a way to use it anyway. I don't have a phone at the moment, and honestly, one call isn't going to help for shit.\n\nI'll probably just do something stupid again and wind up in another mental hospital for (I think) the fifth time.\n\nAnyway, this got fucking dark and will probably get taken down. Idc, I just needed to vent. I don't get to talk to anyone about this shit, and my mom still won't get me a therapist. I've been begging for one for months.

But I don't understand the need for gatekeeping. I did not need clearance from a general practitioner to pursue therapy for major depression and social anxiety. I knew I was depressed and anxious, and sought out a therapist to help me navigate the social aspects of my transition. Similarly, I knew I also needed medical transition, and sought an endocrinologist who practiced informed consent to begin hormones. I recently had top surgery from a surgeon practicing informed consent. I am 10 years into transition and have no regrets or second thoughts all. For all these treatments, I did not need guidance or approval, any more than I do when I establish a relationship with a new GP and tell them I am a type 1 diabetic and will need a prescription for insulin. But recently I have been wondering if this is very atypical thinking for someone of the transmed persuasion.
