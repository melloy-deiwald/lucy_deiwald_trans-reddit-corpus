Born female, (mostly) identify as femme. This has been a big, confusing, long journey for me.\n\nAs a little girl, I often felt at odds with myself, my body, and what was expected from me as a girl. There were times where being a girl felt right, especially when I was able to use my body how I wished (being active, climbing trees, just feeling safe and free). But I often felt so odd when expected to \"act like a lady.\" I never quite knew how to wrap my brain around that. Of course, now I know that I was feeling at odds with expectations and wondering why people wanted me to do some things but not others.\n\nI acted out a lot. I was absolutely fortunately blessed by young, slightly radical parents who in my early years were very much unlike other parents who forced their kids to dress and act through gender norms. My parents' small act of rebellion against their own families' rigid gender roles and judgmental attitudes was such a saving grace. Instead, they simply wanted me to be a strong and happy person. In a lot of ways, days when I feel like I am happy in my skin, I feel closest to that young kid, playing in the mud and running around with the dog with my little sister.\n\nBut puberty hit and I began to feel... weird. Weird all of the time. There was a lot going on in my life, but as my body began to change, people began to treat me differently. From puberty to now, I began to have a recurrent gender crisis (though I didn't know that's what it was until many years later). I began to feel like my clothes, my body, none of it suited me. I would throw out all my feminine clothes and try to do my best to be a boy, as I knew it- unfortunately a lot of that was based on my own internalized misogyny and gender roles. It didn't quite suit me, and then I would feel at odds with myself once again, because I was trying to cram myself into another place that didn't suit me.\n\nIn recent years I have begun to feel that being in a gender and self expression flux is not just a symptom of my anxiety- that there is a reason that every 6 months I begin to feel desperately out of place in my own skin. So began my own journey into understanding myself. \n\nAs it stands, my journey of trying to understand who I was looks a lot like this- straight, tomboy, lesbian, tomboy, androgynous, trying to be a boy, trying to be a girl, lesbian?? Bi, straight, cis, tomboy again, oh my god am I trans??? Wash, rinse, repeat. A lot of that exploration helped me get closer to who I thought I was, but just as much it gave me feelings of depression and self-loathing- I didn't know it, but I had jumped out of one box (straight, cis female) only to try to put myself in another, and I didn't fit.\n\nAs I've come to understand gender theory and the whole gender-sex-attraction thing, I feel like I'm starting to get closer to becoming that person on the inside. It's hard. There's a lot of difficulty, frustration, and pain. But I know that the alternative is even worse.\n\nHello from a non-binary femme. \n\n", "date": "2016-04-05 19:40:59", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/4di42z/always_felt_like_an_odd_duck_ramble/", "author": "SunOnTheInside", "reference": 377}, {"title": "I finaly came out as non binary and it feels good:)", "text": "", "date": "2016-04-08 02:09:54", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/4duent/i_finaly_came_out_as_non_binary_and_it_feels_good/", "author": "queerpunkdyke", "reference": 576}, {"title": "Ideas for a documentary?", "text": "I'm in the planning stage of making a documentary about nonbinary people.

I also don't get a TON of genital dysphoria and If you right now offered me a choice between free orchiectomy and full SRS I'd have some trouble deciding. I also didn't really experience any discomfort or dysphoria with my assigned gender during early childhood if that means anything either. I've also picked out a name for myself already and it reads very feminine but it clicks really well.\n\nI'm really confused and hate feeling this way, especially since my doctor and I are about to discuss increasing my estrogen dose to get closer to normal female range and I want that! These feeling pop-up from time to time and usually go away on their own but they're a little more intense this time? In school when thinking about possibly being Mtf I often thought \"well maybe i'm 'just' nonbinary\" as if that was somehow not as bad as being binary trans. I'm kind of wishing I ran with that a little longer to see what it was like. Maybe I would have had a smoother transition to Mtf even if I was wrong. Now though I'm a good number of months into my physical transition and I just want to get this shit sorted. I've said before that I don't want to delay my transition for anything and that includes this. Unfortunately in this case it feels like I really really should until I figure it out.\n\nUUUUUGHH I'm feeling so frustrated and confused. I thought I was done with this gender questioning bullshit &gt;&lt;. I'm feeling simultaneously \"not binary enough\" and \"not nonbinary enough\" I'm just REALLY confused. I know the real answer to all of this is to do what makes me the happiest but I really don't know what would make me happiest at this point. Maybe these feelings will go away like always and I'll go back to being comfortably female. Maybe I'm just getting too hung up on labels.

I am a 20 year old nonbinary masc AFAB (assigned female at birth) person who is kinda struggling to come out to their parents. I am a college student but when I am on break, I live with my parents and grandparents (my mother's parents). I have been out to my mother since freshman year in high school as a \"lesbian\" and she's been cool with it, although we never really talk about it (I did mention when she picked me up from college this year that I was sorta seeing someone at the time and she seemed pretty chill about it). \n\n\nHowever, I'm struggling to mention my real gender identity to her and how I would like to medically transition (start taking low-dose testosterone so I am more comfortable in my body). Health insurance is awesome and all, but I'm not quite sure that I am ready to come out yet, and I know that the insurance billing gets sent to my house/parents, and I would wish to change that somehow. I'm listed as a dependent on the family health insurance (BCBS), but is there any way I can change the billing of my medical expenses/procedures to my personal address at college? Personally, I feel like it is not my parents' business of what I do medically unless I am ready to tell them/come out to them, but I am also unable to pay out-of-pocket for any therapy or treatments that I wish to go through to start my journey.\n\n\nOn the subject of hormone replacement therapy, I know you can't pick and choose the effects of hormones/testosterone, but I would like to get a lower voice (mine's really girly and high and makes me uncomfortable), squarer jaw, more muscle mass, and hairiness isn't a deal-breaker. I'm a bit nervous about bottom growth, as I do not have bottom dysphoria, and I'm afraid that a decent amount of growth might even give me a bit of bottom dysphoria, but I am pretty small (very, very small) to begin with, so I don't think it won't be a great issue. The reason why I would like to go on a lower dose of T (I know this relates to your own body and how your body handles hormones) is that as I do not identify as male, I do not want to fully present as \"male\"/seem cis-male. I just want to be a bit more masculine physically to match my mental vision of myself.\n\n\nI hope I get some responses from people who can relate/share their experiences and feelings like mine and I hope everyone's having a great day! :-)", "date": "2016-05-10 04:25:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/4inkwb/just_a_nonbinary_masc_afab_person_asking_for/", "author": "zheezy", "reference": 926}, {"title": "Agender Doesn't Exist", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2016-05-11 14:08:26", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/4iv2g1/agender_doesnt_exist/", "author": "[deleted]", "reference": 1069}, {"title": "High School dfab enby person needs help coming out to parents", "text": "Hey!

To that end, I'm implementing a small rule change that OPs of link posts should make a comment after posting that's intended to start discussion. This doesn't have to be an essay! Examples of comments include any or all of the following:\n\n- a short summary of what the link contains (and how it differs from other active posts on the same topic, if applicable)\n- your opinion of the content at the link\n- any sort of question you'd be interested in talking about\n\nr/menslib has endorsed this posting format with great success and has a lot of active posters and threads. Note that I'm not endorsing (or condemning) the content of r/menslib in any way. Plus the nature of their sub's topics draws trolls and their rule is also partially intended to deter pointless #butwhataboutthemen comments, which is not really something we deal with here. But click over there if you want some clear examples of what I mean when I'm asking for investing in discussion when posting.  \n\nI hope that this encourages more participation and a sense of investment here.

When puberty started I became miserable with my body and that feeling has persisted for the 10-odd years since then.

Some of the effects of testosterone are things that I don\u2019t especially want, and I go back and forth between maybe wanting to try a low dose and not starting at all. I went to a doctor once to discuss testosterone and asked him about low dose T, but he basically scoffed in my face and said he doesn\u2019t do \u201cpartial transitions\u201d. I definitely want top surgery but I don\u2019t know if someone like me would be able to get it. \n\nI\u2019m open to the idea that I\u2019m just a cis female with weird hangups, or the idea that this is somehow related to the autism that my parents have always assumed I have. I can\u2019t relate to any trans narrative that I\u2019ve ever heard, but when I see things about ftm transitions I feel like in some ways the people are like me. For 4-5 years I\u2019ve been considering transition but my thoughts on it fluctuate over time. I worry how I would even explain aspects of  transition like top surgery to other people without the \u201cI was always a boy inside\u201d narrative, and I worry about having to live as a man socially when I don\u2019t think that would be easier for me. At the same time I can\u2019t see myself having a future as a woman. To be honest I just don\u2019t know what to do, and college counselors can\u2019t do much to help me. \n\nIs there anyone here who can relate to this? Can we talk about the steps you personally have taken? I\u2019ve gone to a couple ftm meetings in my city but the experience of a trans man is different from mine and I feel like I\u2019m intruding on their meetings.", "date": "2016-07-19 16:35:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/4tm1v8/looking_for_someone_to_talk_to_who_can_relate/", "author": "pasmo", "reference": 1869}, {"title": "Possible Clothing Line - thoughts wanted!", "text": "Hi folks - long time lurker on a lot of gender-related subreddits here, but first time reddit poster so bear with me haha...\n\nAnyway, I'm a non binary MAAB art student who's thinking about creating a NB clothing line, and am looking for a bit of advice and input. I know that there's a few lines out there already, but what I've been seeing so far from places like Selfridges and Zara seems to be a samey and shapeless, tends to be pretty masculine in general and is seems quite expensive/inaccessible to your average person. The vision I've got in my head for this hypothetical line or label would be a bit more vibrant and interesting, form fitting and varied, with the aim of making it accessible to more people. I'd love for it be inclusive to all, and I know that there are also cisgender people out there that would like to have a ungendered option when it comes to shopping for clothes.\n\nPersonally in  the past I've found it pretty hard to find clothes that fit me well - I'm on the skinny side and only about 5'7-5'8 so I'm mainly left with the choice of getting something that fits really well from the women's department but might be too much on the feminine side cut or style-wise for me, or getting something with a more neutral cut or style from the men's department but having it hang off my body, so I'd like for it to be size inclusive and body positive for as many people as possible. Obviously there are practicalities to consider in terms of how many sizes of each item would be do-able as a newly started business/social enterprise, but inclusive is what I'd very much be aiming for as the core of the line.\n\nThe concept is that these are clothes for people, without boundaries, with the only separation being different kinds of cuts and styles - with the idea that one day anyone could walk into a high street store and shop in the clothes department and not feel left out or unwelcome. Anyway, that's my spiel haha, so I was wondering if anyone's got any thoughts on this idea? I'm aware that non-binary clothing isn't a new idea, and there are other things getting started up, but this isn't about rivaling them, just possibly adding my own ideas into the mix to give everybody more options to pick from. But yeah, if there's anything you'd really like to see or that you feel that isn't being catered to at the moment when you're looking for things to wear, I'd very much like to hear your thoughts! \nAgain, first post on reddit so please go easy on me.

So, here I am.\n\nBackground about me - I've always considered myself a leftist, politically, but never got on board with a lot of the radical social leftism that's been getting some spotlight more recently. So, when my girlfriend came out as bigender, I guess I didn't respond as I should have. I'll just come out and say it - I can't understand how this is anything but a mental illness, and I told her as much. I said, in addition, that that's fine with me, she's got others and this doesn't really make a difference, but she still contends its different from a simple delusion or something of the sort. So I'm asking you to explain what the difference is, here. My understanding of all this follows:\n\n\n(and please, guys, grant me the benefit of the doubt here. I'm not trolling, I'm not from fucking the_donald or whatever. This is actually what I believe and I just want to see if maybe you guys can explain it better than my girlfriend can and I can better understand what she's saying.)\n\nThe way I see it, gender is a useless word. Biological sex exists, and gender is a collection of social norms that are entirely subjective and largely sexist. She says that she \"sometimes feels masculine and sometimes, feminine.\" I am completely incapable of understanding this. \n\nI'm not a super masculine alpha male or something, I guess I do or feel things that'd be \"traditionally feminine\" from time to time. I don't feel particularly masculine OR feminine, I just have a Y chromosome with an active SRY gene and that's it. She was not able to explain why she sometimes feels masculine or feminine, and I think that was the biggest sticking point for me, since even these subjective, completely created gender stereotypes are at least loosely defined, and (I'd imagine) feeling masculine or feminine would mean adhering to these stereotypes in some way, which she says is not an accurate way to describe how she feels.\n\nSo, I guess to start, can someone explain to me what this thing actually is? I've read some articles but, to be honest, they seem to be generally written for someone who is already \"initiated\" - meaning someone who isn't convinced this is simply a mental disorder. I can PM our chatlogs (I got permission, don't worry) once I figure out the easiest way to blur out the names involved. \n\nFinally, please, PLEASE believe me when I say I'm not trying to start a shitflinging contest here, and I'm not a fucking right wing subversive element here trying to stir up trouble and bring screencaps of \"st000pid SJWs\" back to my alt right friends. I am actually a 20-something male who is completely and utterly out of the loop insofar as this stuff is concerned.

(Throwaway account for reasons.) I may post this on multiple subs because I need as much advice as I can get.  \nI'm AFAB and going into high school this year. As if starting freshman year in high school isn't nerve wracking enough, I'm genderqueer and have some concerns.  \nA little background information (This paragraph isn't necessary, but I kept it here in case others relate or have advice about other things as well): I've felt mentally androgynous all my life, and was lucky enough to become familiar with non-binary identities last year. My understanding of these identities was very vague at the time, but it was enough to know that it matched me. Since then, I've not only learned much more but transitioned my appearance to look more androgynous, which has made me more confident and comfortable in my own skin. I wear a binder and ambiguous clothing. Fast forward to recently, my frustration with being seen as a girl (social dysphoria) boiled over and I spent months on edge, overly-reinforcing my masculine attributes and snapping at the word \"lady\". Thankfully things have leveled out again and I'm comfortable. What I'm looking for is a few answered questions from some more experienced people. I know some of these are hard because they should be things I'm deciding, but I'd like more input.  \n* First of all, what should I do about changing for gym? My parents say going to a separate room such as a bathroom would make me an outcast and segregate me from others. They think people would wonder about it and such. On the contrary, I wear a binder... I guess I could wear a tank top over it when I change. As long as I convince myself a \"girl's\" locker room is just another way of saying anyone-whose-biological-sex-is-female's locker room, I feel alright with using it.  \n* How are things socially in High School? I've heard it's tougher in regards to drama and teasing. I feel like at the least people will call me gay behind my back because they don't know what to make of me(they did this at the end of 8th grade), and at the most I could be bullied or something. I just want to make my high school years as enjoyable as I can. I also worry if people will initially, if not always, be weary of interacting with me because I'm different.  \n* Should I use a different name? The name I was given at birth is very feminine, and was the 2nd most popular girl name of my year. It's not too bad of a name... but last year I picked out a neutral name for myself that I adore, and my friends call me by it.

This seems to be consistent throughout real life, online friends, both online and offline lgbt-friendly communities, etc.\n\n\nI've come to realize that over time, because of my experiences, I have somehow stereotyped nonbinary self-identification as a \"girl\" thing. Whenever I see someone online declare themselves as nb, a lightning thought goes: \"its probably a woman\". I hate that my brain does this automatic tic. But on some sort of subconscious level, my brain seems to have reasoned that \"nonbinary\" developed primarily because society's narrow limitations on their gender create an image that women don't want to be forced into or associated with. Same thing for nonbinary men, but since society gives men less trouble in general, theres much, much fewer nb men. Idk, I get kind of douchey inside cause my reasoning goes: \"they're still technically female, they just don't like stereotypically girly things. That doesn't mean they're something else. A woman can be whatever she wants, your gender doesn't define you, you dont need to disassociate yourself from it to act the way you want\"\n\n\nThe twist is...I'm a trans man. Those kinds of excuses were what my parents would say to discredit me when I first came out to them. These were the kinds of excuses I made to myself throughout high school trying to come to terms with my identity, only for it to ring hollow. I've been tortured over gender identity my whole life. Being misgendered sucks. So thoughts like this make no sense to me. How could I finally start unraveling my own dysphoria and then shit on other people's, especially when a lot of it coincides with my own fears: what if \"I'm not actually trans, I'm just trying to run away from social standards of womanhood\", what if I'm just a...cowardly woman.\n\n\nIn any case, curious on your thoughts about this, whether anyone has similar internal thoughts and issues.

I always felt this nagging insecurity that I couldn't quite peg. The older I got the more masculine my appearance became and each step I took towards that appearance felt right. Yet at the same time I carried myself in a slightly feminine manner. I enjoyed both. I identified with both.

My hips have gotten more defined and I no longer have that slim flat body. The things that make me noticeably female make me hide. I don't fit into the male clothes like I used to. But I haven't come to the desire of wanting to be a full blown male. I don't mind my female pronoun. I'd prefer a more gender neutral name. And I enjoy my genitalia and have no desire to change it.

So far I have Female, Male, Trans FTM, Trans MTF, Non-binary, Gender fluid, Gender queer, and prefer not to say. \n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "date": "2016-09-29 03:12:15", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5509g7/understanding_gender/", "author": "randy1984-2016", "reference": 2493}, {"title": "Is a relationship between a Cisemder ad a Nonbinary a heterosexual relationship?", "text": "Just a shower thought.", "date": "2016-09-30 13:08:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/557t91/is_a_relationship_between_a_cisemder_ad_a/", "author": "IHeartGrantGustin", "reference": 2629}, {"title": "Nonbinary Resources?", "text": "Hi all!

I'm feeling really really emotional right now and I think that's a sign that I'm doing the right thing. I'm still new to learning terms so I hope I do not offend and this is the right place to post. By my understanding, nonbinary can be a broad term so I thought I'd try here.\n\nI am AFAB? I was assigned female at birth and I am 23 years old. Already that makes me feel quite old in the community as I see amazing non binary young children discovering who they are but, I suppose that's their journey and not mine.\n\nThere are times in my life, I do not feel I identify as a woman. There are times where I will dress or attempt to dress more \"masculine\" (I put in quotes because definitions of these things are so fluid?). This is something I've done, or feel I have done for a few years now. I gradually started to wear less skirts and dresses, although I do now and then. To be honest, sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel really exposed. \n\nAnd that's something I've noticed lately. Sometimes having breasts makes me feel uncomfortable. I was a smaller size a little while ago, experienced the same thing and it's worse now they're bigger. That is something I have experienced for as long as I can remember. They feel like two foreign objects on my chest that get in my way and I, for a moment, wish to take them off. But again, this is not 100% of the time.\n\nI have in the past and recently had people refer to me using female pronouns (she/her). It makes me almost flinch, something feels off and I almost feel like they're not talking about me. I find also lately I'm trying to explore my gender expression so on days where I feel very disassociated with my birth gender, this irks me. Recently when my flatmate was having company, I subconsciously felt awkward because I was the only \"boy\". Referring to myself as such didn't feel off. \n\nI have a close group of male friends I formed over the years and there are social situations where they perhaps will almost feel the need to apologise for comments that women may find offensive. This also confuses me and feels unnecessary. \n\nI know a very common narrative amongst the trans* community is having strong feelings growing up. I know that I have for sure thought of a male name that I would go by. I also did wear a boy's top that my parents let me purchase (but I don't think that's a huge deal). \n\nI do enjoy wearing makeup, although I haven't for a while and recently it's just not been my thing. When I dress up and make an effort, so to speak, it feels off. It feels like I'm drawing attention to myself that I feel uncomfortable with. I have constantly battled to be body positive and love myself but I also have been diagnosed with body image distortions so that doesn't help.\n\nI have also (just last night, for the first time) attempted to bind and tuck in the privacy of my home. I'm so so very curious. I did recently date someone else who is non binary and transitioning. I can't help but think that at first, I was researching to get a better understanding, to support. But here I am, still researching. I thought I wanted to be more like this person, that I was taking on too much of their personality. Could it be possible I am processing their transition for them or really it's just triggered a lot of repressed feelings I've had since I was younger.\n\nI'm so confused, I feel emotional and so alone. I plan on potentially mentioning this to a doctor soon. Even if I find I am cisgender, I feel l need to address why I keep coming back to this uncertainty. I believe that there's no way I'd be questioning and researching this much unless I felt something on some level.

I'm 24 and for work classified as a female. How ever I'm non-binary and I'm so happy I can say that out loud.\n\nGrowing up I was a tomboy and it never really left the older I became. I just never felt like a girl and in later years never really felt like a boy either, I was just well me, and that\u2019s how people saw me. That weirdo over there, and by the end of highschool I had come to accept it. I recall feeling pissed off and frustrated and getting into yelling matches for years with trying to explain to people that I'm not a girl. How ever puberty blessed me with curves and a very feminine body, that I hated for years. I went through the make up phase and all of it was inspired by David Bowie that man changed my life. I also would do my best to flatten my chest  so my boobs weren\u2019t so apparent, and having large boobs that wasn\u2019t the easiest thing to do. Over the years  I have come to love my body, and discovered I can be me regardless of what I look like now a days.\n\nOne summer in highschool I was watching the discovery channel about transgenders and how people felt trapped in there bodies. And I was like I feel trapped in my body, but I don\u2019t want to change what I look like, maybe have smaller boobs but that\u2019s it. My dad was convinced for years that I was going to be a boy. We have long since had that conversation and hes okay with me just being well me. This how ever never stopped me from leaning more toward masculine roles or just in my mind being in strong roles. I avoided dresses, and well all over girly clothing, because it made me feel so awkward. I did wear prom dresses and dresses for musicals but I knew I was playing so it didn\u2019t bug me, I was confused to why it was actually fun. Then again I was always confused haha. I recall past boyfriends being like you need to wear this or that and then getting upset when I didn\u2019t. I was completely confused, lost, and always pissed off at the world. Because how could no one understand what I was talking about?\n\nIt would always go well your not transgender so you should be happy with your body, well your not a boy because you have boobs and a vagina, your attracted to dudes, or blah blah blah. I would always end up in tears and sometimes very drunk It was really unhealthy. I had some shitty relationships and at some point i was like well maybe this was all stemmed from that, because i had read somewhere that people, sometimes will want to change their gender so the feel less vulnerable and wont get hurt again. But I was like nah because Ive felt like this for years. \nI went to college hoping to figure it out wrong, found my love for food though, and more hate and then depression. I had left a guy id been with for 3 years. Add that to all the other stuff and i was off in a bad way. It all came to a head when I stared playing around with make up and thinking well this is what society wants. I was miserable, all I knew is that I wasn\u2019t a girl but i wasn\u2019t a boy and no one believed me. I didn\u2019t want to tell my parent because My brother had just came out of the closet and I didn\u2019t want to over shadow him or make their lives even more confused.  Now looking back at it I wish I had try to join the LGBT club on campus, but I was also working 3 jobs so that may have been hard. However there is always more clubs to join. Fast forward a few years. I joined the military, best decision I have made so far. \n\nI was like will military manly it works, little did i know that it was going to be the changing point in my inner struggle. I was waiting to be sent to my duty station when a friend back home had sent me a video going ,i think you might like this. It was Ruby Roses transformation video. I watched it it put me in tears, i was like that\u2019s it, I have no idea what its called but that\u2019s it. So i looked up Ruby Rose and found out that she was non-binary. I just started reading articles, and books, because i had the time at the time. I was satisfied and felt really freed, it was the best birthday present I could have gotten that year. Only took 22 years for me to figure out what to call myself, and 2 years later I'm still making so many self-discoveries.\n\nNow its not been rainbows and unicorns, but Ive never felt better. I even found a partner who really care about me for me. He thinks I\u2019m a bit odd sometimes but really doesn\u2019t question it, in all fairness he\u2019s a bit odd too haha. There are days when ill dress like a girl and days ill dress like a boy that hasn\u2019t changed. Well dressing like a girl has but I really only do it when I feel comfortable with it. He has told me I don\u2019t care what you do has long as I don\u2019t have to wear a dress. Fair is fair. I have also discovered Ruplaus drag race and im in love! I want to be a DIVA like them haha\nI know I just rambled but I really hope this helps some one out oneday\n\n", "date": "2016-10-04 02:43:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/55rgbb/finally_understand_myself_or_am_starting_too/", "author": "veggiebunnie", "reference": 284}, {"title": "nonbinary eligibility for SRS?", "text": "Hello-\nI am just beginning my transition, MTF, but I plan to present as somewhat nonbinary. my question is if anybody on here has experience with surgery as a nonbinary person?

Even though I have small breasts, I feel like I shouldn't have them at all. I don't want them. And having periods and a vagina just feels... wrong somehow. Like I shouldn't have them either. I'm also terrified of (and somewhat repulsed by) the idea that I might become pregnant someday. I know that pregnancy and childbirth are amazing things that allow humans to survive, but to me they're... disgusting almost? I don't know the word. I just never want either of those things to happen to me. I just... don't want to be female.

However, socially, I still identify with womanhood because that is what I've experienced my whole life, and I don't regret it despite the dysphoria. I don't think I was a \"boy my whole life.\" I think I was a girl growing up, and one day I was like \"ok, enough of that, time to transition.\" But really, I don't care what pronouns my friends use because I feel like they understand who I am. I only care that strangers call me he/him because 1) safety 2) people generally don't understand nonbinary identities/care to understand the complexity of my gender 3) because my physical dysphoria is still so prevalent, I would rather be perceived as \"male\" because that means my body and face are changing.

Fit, athletic(ish), non-binary on HRT, trying to keep my appearance male but with aspects of female. A foot in both camps, so to speak. \n\nWhy am I here? Well, I'm hoping that someone can offer some practical and emotional advice regarding my relationship, which has been going amazingly well up till now -- we've hit a rocky shore.\n\nMy relationship with cis female has been awesomely amazing, we are really close. However, while I thought I was heading towards full transition, we both knew that the relationship would end, because that's not what she wanted. \n\nBut, lo! After a lifetime of being in the closet, then 5-years of agonising over my identity, I discovered that I did not want to transition fully and finally felt really good about myself. Yay me! \n\nAnyway, my discovery was eventually revealed to my partner in a long heartfelt discussion, the both of us breathing sighs of relief that our relationship was intact. As it turned out, some level of transition is fine. \n\nFast forward another couple of months and I get the chilling, emotion-laden \"We need to talk\". I was told that I have continued to develop physical, emotional and behavioural changes to a more female level, which, for my partner, crossed the line. Personally, I don't think the changes have been huge, so that's a little scary for me, because if it's that fine a line I'm not sure I can contain my development within such a narrow window. Then again, it's probable that both of our observational perspectives are skewed: she seeing more changes based on her knowledge of my being on HRT (I'm yet to be clocked as anything other than male), while I am likely a little oblivious to day-to-day changes and not seeing overall continued development. \n\nThe upshot of these developments is that my partner has lost some sexual attraction to me, where she says that it's not the same as before, though we are still very physical in more emotional ways. This recent development is not the end, according to my partner, as we both believe our relationship to be very special and worth working on. To be honest, I was happy with my physical development when we had our first talk about this, so any additional changes are kind of arbitrary to me and am not at all against rolling back some of my meds (but how do I regulate this to keep, more or less, an equilibrium?)\n\nHowever, I do have some doubts as to whether someone who has lost sexual attraction based on transition changes can ever get that attraction back. There's also the emotional toll on me being told that my partner has lost their sexual attraction to me, which I think is quite significant and makes me feel insecure in the relationship.\n\nSo, questions. \n\n1. What do people think of this situation generally (please ask for more info or clarification in needed)?\n\n2.

I took the plunge (hrt- Testosterone) My experience so far. (x-post /r/genderqueer)", "text": "So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently.\n\nWhen I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.\n\nFor a long time, I struggled with that big secret (\"I want to be a boy\"), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.\n\nFinally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.\n\nSo far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm.\n\nThe best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.\n\nBut suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.\n\nCurrently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the \"rules\" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.\n\nI love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had.\n\nI won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.\n\nThank you all.\n", "date": "2016-11-18 01:02:34", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5djm95/nonbinary_gender_fluid_i_took_the_plunge_hrt/", "author": "SunOnTheInside", "reference": 1755}, {"title": "Worried about being able to get HRT", "text": "I'm agender, dfab, and wanting hormone replacement therapy.

I'm desperate here and having ideations for about 4 months now. Lowest I've ever been. I am nonbinary. I have had successful relationships since high school with women. I was practically engaged just recently and we broke up because we had intimacy problems. This is the first time I have had experience with this and I'm not sure if its because I usually dated more conscious and active mates or if I have just come to a cross roads internally.  Here it goes:\n\nShe has always been gay. She is femme. She still had a bit of a princess complex which didn't help, but she constantly made me feel not masculine enough no matter how many times I would resist and say hey I am a woman too or I am very much both and enjoy being this way. She knew me when she met me, but again probably more projection during the honeymoon phase. In the late beginning we hit an issue when she told me she would like me to be even more aggressive and to hit her and choke her during sex, and for me with a history of physical and sexual abuse that was not a turn on and in fact was triggering in the moment. I had had experience giving it a try with another failed relationship, and knew myself this time. sigh. I told her that as a therapist, I can't ignore the fact that we are lacking true intimacy before I consider jumping to emotionless extremes. I already am an aggressive partner so this was confusing. I was open to her about this and we moved on but not without her constantly digging at me or cutting me down for not being a machismo fuckboi or some faux-confident gangster twat. Literally, what it felt like. She wanted me to be this unemotional object and would continue to cut down my nature, and eventually called me things like meek and soft, which I am aware that I am not. The oddest thing is I am fairly masculine and have always presented an even mix of both since childhood. I am in good shape and heck we were in love, so it was of course deeply upsetting after awhile. Eventually intimacy fell flat, I could tell her perception of me had changed. I wasn't sure if it was bc I refuse to be sadistic or its because of my abuse which I had to divulge. We talked about sex and it was a new reason each time. I have never had this intrapsychic struggle before, I've always been very comfortable letting my body be what it is. I constantly tried to initiate sex and all the different ways she requested or was expecting and she still overtly rejected me, one time she legit took her foot and pushed me away. I would leave every once in awhile for a night upset convinced she needed a different kind of partner, but she would beg and fit for me to come back. But she still tried absolutely nothing to make the situation easier or to get over the hurdle, as I tried. Zero effort, just ignored it and left me seriously confused about my self for awhile. We even went to therapy three times and the last session she came in and said she wanted someone who was more of an initiator! And yes, I was shocked and felt ambushed and responded by explaining how often I try to and she rejects me. The next day we ended it. \n\nIts been months and she handled it pathologically and told me that she wasn't getting wet and that I didn't tease her enough. She clearly does not know how to be vulnerable or intimate to even get to this stage. Maybe princesses live their lives constantly wet with a partner of 3 years, but I certainly didn't and told her this. \n\nI'm aware of her own issues here, that is not the response I'm looking for. What I am needing is some help. I feel obliterated and even asexual and not much like living. The most fucked up thing is that she dated someone who is now a FTM. I dont think its coincidental, but for me that is so against my fluid nature. Sad thing is if I was trans, I would probably take it even harder considering they truly want to present masculine... sadly sometimes toxically, which in this case they'd really not react well. I can't think of anyhting more psychologically abusive and narcissistic than to completely devastate someones sexuality. \n\nHas anyone had trouble in their relationships with their partners projecting faux-femininity or toxic masculinity on them? How did you survive times of deep and utter internal confusion and pain? How do you initiate as nonbinary and have you ever run into partners that got confused with your denial of roles? Have you evver had trouble with resistance, for instance when a partner wishes for you to be more of either gender, and you rebel by becoming even more of the opposite?

What does get to me is little moments when people really want to draw attention to the fact that you're somehow not acting \"right\" if that makes sense.\n\nFor instance, I'm currently playing a male character on Pokemon Sun. I've been playing as a guy since Alpha Sapphire and honestly wish I could have changed my X character to a guy. I am AFAB, most people in my life met me as a \"woman\" and I don't really pass most days. Every time someone sees my character, whether over my shoulder or during a battle, they're all \"YOU'RE PLAYING A GUY FILUEFOIEUF\". Even the ones I've come out to. Like, yes, you see, being nonbinary sometimes means that I often like to represent myself as the gender other than the one you \"know\" me as. Surprise.\n\nA few times I've been involved in conversations about sexism and whatnot, and I occasionally say \"as someone who is seen as female\" or \"read as a woman\", and typically people who are barely involved in the conversation will chime in with \"LOL SEEN AS?\" It's really not relevant. Why draw attention to it? I've just started reverting back to saying \"as a woman\" but I really hate it. I guess it's not an entirely wrong statement but every time I say it I feel like I'm lying to myself or about myself. \n\nOf course there's the flip side of it where people will remind me how they read me as female with every little gesture I make. \"Oh, that way you breathed? I've always seen women breath that way\". A small exaggeration sure but it sums up so many interactions that feel like nails on chalkboard to me. It feels like I can't express liking something without someone popping up to tell me how that clarifies my \"femininity.\" There are also people, even people who have known me for a long time and should at least know I'm not especially interested in most \"feminine\" things, who still try to push the extreme, stereotypical sides of that identity on me. Literally, a few weeks ago I was masculine presenting and binding and feeling great about myself and a friend of mine gives me earrings and talks about how, as a girl, I should get my ears pierced by now. That hurt, and it still hurts now, and I know I shouldn't be dwelling on it and my friend meant well but that was some real bad timing. There's nothing wrong with femininity, I have a feminine side, but when it's all anyone ever sees of me and identifies me as it makes me wilt. \n\nIt's funny, there are lots of people out there who think people who identify like I do are looking for attention. I just kinda want to be left alone. Stop trying to analyze me. I can't stop people from putting me in a box, but I wish they'd stop telling me where they're putting me. How far do I have to masculinize myself before people learn to shut up? Why do I have to do that to myself before I'm allowed to be taken seriously? I don't want to go around biting everyone's heads off with my identity, I don't even want it to come up at all, but everyone seems really eager to talk about it. \n\nI'm sure I'm not alone in this.

In addition to this, I also want to wear certain women's clothes on a semi-regular basis. :) Finally, I also want to get prosthetic testicles after my (planned) orchiectomy. (As for the HRT, I will use whatever HRT I am most comfortable with; however, as I have previously stated here, the orchiectomy is non-negotiable due to the current extreme child support laws.) Also, if this makes any difference, I myself get sexually aroused both my imaging myself having prosthetic testicles as well as by imagining myself having a vagina; of course, I certainly place *a lot* of value on things such as penis-in-vagina sex and thus certainly prefer to have a penis plus prosthetic testicles than to have a vagina.\n\nBasically, though, what I am wondering is this: What exactly does it mean when I get sexually aroused by imaging myself having my ideal body and face? Frankly, I feel that after I will sufficiently feminize both my body and my face, I would literally be able to get sexually aroused and to orgasm merely by looking at my own body--preferably with certain female clothes on myself! :)\n\nIndeed, are such feelings normal for transgender and gender non-conforming people? After all, I feel that I can get *almost* as much of an orgasmic experience and *almost* as much sexual joy from merely looking at my own body and face (*after* I will sufficiently feminize both it and my face, that is)--preferably with certain female clothes on myself--than I can get from things such as having penis-in-vagina sex. Heck, during my childhood, I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of wearing female clothes *way* before I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of having penis-in-vagina sex (indeed, the former occurred at age 9 or 10--shortly after I began hitting puberty--while the latter occurred shortly before my 16th birthday). Heck, even as late as high school, many--if not most--of my sexual fantasies involved me having a feminine body and face as well as wearing female clothes (as opposed to me having sex with women)! :)\n\nBasically, what I am trying to figure out is the *meaning* of these feelings of mine; indeed, while I certainly know what I want to do in regards to both my body and my face (as well as which female clothes to wear afterwards, of course), I also want to try figuring out the *meaning* of these feelings of mine.

My mom thought this was adorable/creative and encouraged me, while my dad low key freaked out about it. However, he was not super involved in my life and I had much more regard for my mom's opinion than his.\n\nIn second grade, I changed my name to Max. All my friends at school and my teacher were cool with it. Then one day, about two or three weeks in, I had a substitute teacher who gave me grief for it, so I went back to my girl name.\n\nMy mom was cool with the name change, though. Overall, she did a great job not strictly enforcing gender roles on my brother and me. She would never designate a Barbie as a \"girl toy\" or a Tonka truck as a \"boy toy,\" and would let either of us play with whatever toys we wanted. When other adults called me \"bossy,\" she would say that I was assertive or a leader. She taught my brother that it was okay to cry and otherwise express his feelings, and that his favorite color could indeed be pink. Once I declared that I no longer wanted to wear dresses or skirts, she accepted it and let me wear pants, shorts, and overalls. \n\nDespite the nuanced understanding of gender that she tried to foster, as I got older I saw that society regarded men and women, as well as masculinity and femininity, as binaries. I staunchly identified with everything masculine and eschewed all things feminine. All of my friends were boys, and I referred to myself as a tomboy.\n\nWhen I went through puberty, however, I started feeling more pressure to be feminine and present as a woman. I also developed a negative body image and self-esteem issues. Not being feminine no longer felt like a choice: it felt like I was too ugly to be a woman.\n\nNow that I'm older, I've become comfortable with and confident in myself. I went to a 90's costume party as Joey and felt super strong and confident adopting a masculine persona. I've recently cut my hair short, so my general look is fairly androgynous.\n\nWhen I was sixteen or seventeen, I began to identify as bisexual, and coming to that realization was a very nerve-wracking experience for me. More recently I started to identify as pansexual, and going through the questioning phase was less stressful this time.

My teacher taught it from the perspective of a feminist sci fi world construction, which it undeniably is, but I felt somehow really into this world on a deeper level. I genuinely wanted to be like the aliens in the book, where they were typically androgynous but could change gender depending on the contexts (it has been a long time since I've read the book so forgive me if I'm misremembering some things).\n\nI've also found myself obsessed with shape shifting characters as I grew up, especially if they were show switching between male and female forms. I always told people that shape shifting would be the superpower I'd want, obstensibly saying it's the perfect way to cheat into having all the powers you'd want (want to fly? Turn into a bird. Want to be invincible? You're a rock now. Super strength? Giant ant.) but even then, in my head, I'd think about how I'd probably typically use this power to switch between genders at will. \n\nObviously, this is mostly impossible. I can't exactly just go \"welp, I'm feeling masculine this week, time for some T\" to \"this week's girl's week so let's go that way.\" Clothes and presentation can only do so much, especially on my overtly feminine body (it's lovely when your boobs basically stretch your binder into a tight tank top). \n\nBut I still take some inspiration from these stories and characters. Are there stories/characters that you guys take these same thoughts from?
