Feel like I'm having a crisis with my gender.", "text": "Hey friends. Lately I've been having some really painful and scary feelings of needing to transition. I'm 21 years old and currently male. Sorry in advance if some details in this wall of text are TMI. I'm trying to just get everything out of my head and into this post. I'd really appreciate it if you have the time to read it and help me out with some wisdom. Theres a tl;dr at the end because this is a huge post.\nSorry for the throwaway account. I'm sure you can guess why.  \n\n**The story so far:**  \n\n\nThe earliest I remember feeling like I was in the wrong body was when I was 5 years old. I was in preschool and I remember trying to convince another boy that I was secretly a girl. I cringe at this memory but I guess it's kind of sweet depending on how you look at it. I also have memories of trying to invert my genitals at a very young age (like, push it inside my body). I didn't know why at the time, but I knew I wanted it to go inwards and be flat on the outside. I also remember having to explain to my mother why I picked female characters in Mario Kart, and quickly coming up with the excuse of 'I pick all of them equally'. Even at that age, I knew this was something I had to lie about. Lying about this became a big theme in my life from this point forward.   \n\n\nBetween then and the age of 13 (or so), I didn't spend much time thinking about my gender at all. I wasn't really aware that transgender was a real thing. At this point I was very awkward and occasionally got teased at school, but for some reason my confidence was still relatively high and I remained a fairly talkative, happy child.   \n\nWhen I was 14 (or around then) my family went on a short holiday. I had my own room with it's own bathroom, and one night I found myself, in my newfound privacy, looking in the mirror, fantasising about waking up female the next day. I repeated this each night, imagining myself slowly becoming more female in a number of different fantastical circumstances. The thought excited me in that special way that you can feel in your chest. This was when I started to think seriously about why I wanted to be a girl so badly.  \n\nAge 15. My research led me to a number of online resources and armed with this knowledge, I ended up coming out to my mother, who cried and tried to tell me it was a phase. I don't hold it against her at all. She told my dad, who, in her words, 'tried to act like it never happened'. When the gender psychologist she took me to said it was time to start thinking about HRT, she cut all ties with him, and I stopped seeing him. My mother and I had a really awkward argument about it and since then the topic has barely been discussed at all. I spent the next few years in and out of awkward phases as a result of never feeling comfortable in my own skin.  \n\nWhen I was 18, I got a girlfriend and stopped thinking about it for a while. I tried to convince myself I would be able to just live my life as a male. In my head, I had a choice between my career and creative ambitions (which I was heavily focusing on), and transitioning. I chose the former, because transitioning seemed almost impossible. When I was 19, the feelings of wanting to become a woman were intensifying, but I doubled down on trying to ignore them and live a fulfilling life as a male. At this point, I knew I was female in my head, but thought I'd be able to find happiness without transitioning. My relationship ended for unrelated reasons, and I met a new girl, who continues to light up my life almost 3 years later.  \n\nI'm now 21 now, and over the past few years, I've been withdrawing more and more into my comfort zone. I'm experiencing social anxiety to a stronger extent than I can ever remember, despite being happy with my friendships and my relationship. This is leading me to spend extended periods alone, often engaging in escapism through tv shows and video games. I feel really depressed lately, and often struggle to see any goodness or positivity in life. Sometimes I get consumed by a feeling of hopelessness. And I've never needed to be female more. The feeling of excitement I get when I think about transitioning is overwhelming. A few nights a week, I lock myself in my room and dress in some skirts and dresses I bought online. I actually wore some make-up for the first time tonight and loved what I saw. It feels amazing, but its so crushing knowing I can't leave my bedroom in these clothes without being humiliated.   \n\nI love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. She supports me through my moodiness and depression to a huge extent. She has no knowledge of my gender issues, and I feel like she'd have a hard time with me transitioning. If I'm being honest, I expect she'd have to break up with me, because she's not romantically attracted to girls. One night however, we were watching a TV show about transgender people in the UK, and out of nowhere, she joked that if I decided to become a woman she'd still love me. I can't tell how serious she was being, and I don't want to be too hopeful. I have a feeling the reality of transitioning would be way more dramatic than either of us could imagine. This is the number one thing which stops me from transitioning. Maybe we could still be best friends afterwards? I hate thinking about living my life without her.  \n\nSo here I am, 21 years old, wishing I were female on the outside more than ever. And yet, the thought of becoming a transgirl scares me more than anything. I honestly think I have a pretty good shot at passing, as I have a feminine face and a slim physique, but if I were to transition and not pass I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I suppose I just really really wish I could be female without having to go through transitioning. I'm terrified of the social repercussions, and at my prospects of having the career I want if I were to transition. I don't know how my family would react. I'm really scared. If I were confident I could transition successfully and pass I'd do it in a heartbeat, but I just feel petrified with fear and unable to act. And with every month that passes, I feel like my chances of becoming a feminine woman get lower and lower.  \n\n\n**tl;dr:** I really want to transition but don't want to lose the girl I love and am terrified of the social repercussions of being trans. Passing is really important to me and I'm scared that I won't be satisfied with my femininity.   \n\nAny advice you have for me is much appreciated.

I thought maybe your service had loosened it's archaic naming rules, but alas, no. Let me clue you in here, though I am almost sure you know exactly what is happening. I am a trans woman. For the less educated among you, that means I do not identify as the gender assigned to me at birth, and identify as a woman. I actually used Facebook to announce this publicly, when I first decided to do so, on the 28th of June, 2015. I was impressed, then, at how simple it was to change your name and pronouns on Facebook, to those that you prefer. It was then, that I changed my name on Facebook from Jack James Harley, my birth name, to Jacqueline Jade Blackburn, my prefered name. That is the name I use in my everyday life and that is the only name I have had for 7 months. I find it amazing, then, to be contacted asking to prove my identity. Like there is some kind of fakery, or trickery, going on. As if I am somehow lying to the world. I not only find this abhorrent and rude, but would class it as downright discrimination. You say it is necessary, in order for people to connect with me on Facebook. I find this excuse ludicrous, for I have had no problem connecting with people on Facebook for the last 7 months, nor has anyone had problems connecting with me. From family I have not seen in years to people I barely meet at parties, connecting with people has been no more difficult now than ever. You are not asking me for identification to help people connect with me. You are asking for my identity as a personal attack upon my identity. That is how it feels, at the very least. \n\n\"When we discover accounts that look fake or like they\u2019re using fake information, we ask the owner to confirm they are who they say they are.\"\n\nI am very curious about this line specifically, taken from your \"Help Centre\" (very helpful). When you discover accounts that look fake, or like they are using fake information? How do you discover these accounts? What constitutes an account \"looking fake\"? It all seems very suspicious to me. I believe that you reported my account because you know, as everyone does, that the name I use is not my legal name, and the gender I use is not my legal gender, yet. And so you feel you have the right to demand that I prove to you that I am who I say I am. Well guess what? You don't have that right. Legally, you might. But morally? You have no right to demand that of me, and you shall get no such pleasure from me. You want to deactivate my account because I am a trans young person, trying as we all are to fight so many barriers just to be ourselves? You go right ahead.

In all that time, we loved and supported each other without fail, and always communicated our issues without fighting. We've helped each other grow, we've seen each other through struggle, we've shared moments of immense joy, and we've had what could be said to be a fairytale relationship for all of 4 years.\n\nExcept, I'm a woman. And she's not a lesbian. And there's nothing either of us can do about either of those things.\n\nWe've been long distance for our entire relationship (PA/CA) and only saw each other for a week or so at a time every few months. Still, the time we spent together was incomparable happiness, and even when apart we skyped almost every night for hours.\n\nLast August, I came to terms with 10 years of feelings and began to seriously consider that I might be a woman. I told her that night, and I was met with a lot of discomfort. She supported me, but even though she was interested in women sexually, she was never interested in a relationship with one. She said if I transitioned, we probably wouldn't stay together. After a few hours of placating her and convincing her she was more important to me than that, she was okay.\n\nI convinced her that I was genderfluid, that I still valued my male identity. Over the next few months, I experimented in my free time, dressing up, exploring my true self. I occasionally sent her pictures, and got sometimes enthusiastic responses. But I never knew how she would feel when I sent her something. She would sometimes get upset, and I would try to say that it would feel different in person.\n\nEventually I got my chance, when I spent 10 days with her the week of Thanksgiving. Towards the end of my trip, I dressed up with her one night. I wore my wig and a tshirt with a pair of leggings, and she did my makeup. I was happy. We were happy. We took pictures together. When I asked if it felt different in person, she said yes.\n\nAfter I returned, I didn't dress up again for a while. I grew my beard out again so that nobody would be suspicious when I went home for my school's Christmas break. Over those 3 weeks, it killed me having to stay in my mom's one room apartment without being able to tell her. My girlfriend helped me deal with those feelings, and again everything seemed great. She was so supportive, and really helped me deal with what I was feeling.\n\nAfter I came back to school, I shaved all my body hair, and bought a dress and heels. It made me feel so right. This past Sunday, I dressed up and sent her pictures again. Since then, she's been distant. Last night, when we skyped, I got the dreaded \"we need to talk.\" We talked, and I finally fessed up. I'm a woman. It's plain as day. I can't do anything about that. After a lot of talking and a lot of crying, the 4 best years of my life ended, in the blink of an eye.\n\nWhat hurts the most is that both of us still desperately want to be together. There's nothing I can do about how I feel, and there's nothing she can do about how she feels. It's nobody's fault. But it hurts. It hurts so much. I don't know if we'll ever stop loving each other, but it just can't go on.\n\nI know this is best for me in the long term. My exploration of my identity now only has to make me happy and nobody else, and I know that's the only way I can truly be who I am. I just wish it didn't have to be this way.\n\nMaybe somewhere down the line, we can be together again post transition; I think the hardest thing for her was seeing the person she fell in love with slowly go away. But, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nI don't know where to go from here.

After being shut out by a number of other surgeons due to not wanting to get involved with another surgeons work, I was finally able to convince my original surgeon to take action. One year after my initial surgery,  my surgeon performed a revision, but failed to address all of my concerns, and outright refused to address certain ones, such as the orientation of my clitoris. Once it became apparent that I continued to have problems, I again agitated for redress, but this time they simply terminated the doctor patient relationship. For months, I searched for a surgeon willing to help me, all the while being in considerable physical discomfort and experiencing the mental ramifications of the lineage of trauma I was subjected to. Finally, I found Dr. Reed, who validated my problems and agreed to help me. Four days ago, I underwent a third surgery and while he is optimistic that he addressed my problems, I remain cautious about the results, as everything is still quite raw.

I don't mind being mistaken for one; it's kind of exciting.  Looking in the mirror though, I do have a cute fem face. I like my face. It's not that I'm disappointed exactly, but I can't stop wondering how I would feel about myself if I were male with the broader jawline and more pronounced, hardened features. \n\nSorry I can't think of a way to cut this down, and thanks so much for reading all of it for those who do.

Also, while I read Reddits regularly, this is my first attempt at a post, so I apologize if I mess anything up formatting-wise.\n\nI am a 31 year old who was born male, I have a wonderful wife, a solid career as an editor and community college instructor, and a wonderful 4-month old son. For the most part, my life is great, but certain feelings have been rather persistent now that my life finally feels in order. \n\nWhen I was younger (as young as anywhere between 5 and 10) I used to always imagine what my life would be like if I was a girl instead of a boy. I played with toys meant for both genders--I had my Ninja Turtles and loved them, but I also played with my sister's Barbie dolls. I would imagine myself as the female characters in cartoons as much as the male characters (really, more so--I preferred to pretend I was Apirl O'Neil rather than any of the turtles for instance). I would go to sleep praying that I would wake up a girl even. And, yes, sometimes I snuck my sister's or mother's clothes when I was alone. \n\nAll of that seemed to leave when I hit puberty though. I would still have the thoughts once in a while, but not nearly as much--maybe once every few months for a bit. New issues arose as I started to realize that my sexuality was not exactly the \"norm\" either. My first hard crush was on a guy friend of mine. Long story short, I discovered I was bisexual. All those child-hood thoughts were pushed aside and I chalked it up to symptoms of my sexual identity as opposed to my gender identity. At most, I thought maybe I just admired women's clothes or even fetishized them or something.\n\nNot long after, I met the woman who is now my wife, a beautiful woman that I am very much attracted to and in love with. Fast forward another decade and I have a career, a marriage, and a kid, but now my thoughts of being a woman have resurfaced hard. To the point, even, that I became very depressed.\n\nMy wife bothered me until I spilled the beans. This was only just a week ago, so my life feels like it is entering a whole new whirlwind. Strangely though, I felt a lot of relief having confided these feelings in her--especially when she said she wanted to support me. I'm not feeling depressed like I was before, but the feelings (I guess dysphoria?) are still there, and I find myself questioning my gender identity more and more. \n\nOn the outside, I am very masculine in appearance despite having a few feminine mannerisms. I had a beard up until recently (all the guys in my family do so I did too), stand 6'1\", and have pretty firm muscles. But something just doesn't feel like it fits. I don't think I could ever be \"girly,\" but I can't help but imagine having a feminine figure, breasts, hips, the whole nine yards. \n\nI just imagine I would be a tomboy--but why would I want to be a tomboy if I was born male? That is what is so confusing. I don't know what to do exactly. \n\nI come from a family that barely accepts my sexuality, so I know they wouldn't this. It's hard to experiment with it too since my wife's mother lives with us. I feel trapped and the depression, though briefly assuaged by my confession to my wife, seems like it will return. \n\nWhat I want to know is if anyone out there has had a similar experience? I am sure that is a silly question, as I am sure someone has; however, perspective from those with such a similar experience would be very helpful to me I think.\n\nMy wife agrees that I should probably see a therapist, and I would like to once I am able to find one that will accept my insurance--unfortunately my job's insurance requires I contact them first and I am afraid they are going to pry into why I need a therapist. She also wants to stay with me, and wants to try if I do end up transitioning, though we both sort of know things would not work out. She is bi-curious, but it does not go beyond curiosity. \n\nAgain, please let me know if there is a better place to post this and ask this question. \n\nTl;dr: I am a 31 yo born male, married, bi, but might be a trans-tom boy if there is such a thing; very confused and wondering if anyone else in a similar situation could offer perspective", "date": "2016-03-04 20:55:17", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/48z9h8/am_i_on_the_spectrum_i_feel_it_but_maybe_not/", "author": "RestlessForm", "reference": 339}, {"title": "Tuesday, March 8th, Sean Baker (director of last year's Tangerine, a story about transgender prostitutes hunting down their pimp) will host an AMA on r/truefilm!

The absurd part is that I spent so long in such a terrible place in my head without knowing what the problem was. Once I figured it out it was like waking from a bad nightmare. Accepting this has given me peace with the world. I get this recurring thought: \"I'll finally be a normal person once I do this and I'll be able to move on with my life\".

He's too important for me to lose. I felt like the worst friend ever.\n\nAfter the cops took me to the ER, the crisis counselor didn't seem to think there was any danger of hurting myself if they released me. I talked to my dad about it, and some of my other friends. Me and my best friend eventually made up over it and everything is fine. Everything is okay. Nothing is wrong. I'm fine. I don't understand how this is still a big deal after it's been resolved. I don't feel like hurting myself anymore, and I'm not going to try again even if he gets angry and throws this same fit again.\n\nI'm usually not like this.

I'm still stable. I just had one moment of impulsivity and pain and sadness in my otherwise okay life.

About half of the attendees are from the state. Many, including myself, are from out of state. A number of us have been discussing not attending the gathering this year, but the truth is that this is only likely to hurt the person who has already shelled out money to organize the event. Rescheduling or relocating is not an option.\n\nOur group is primarily but not exclusively men, mostly straight.\n\nSome of us had been floating the idea of finding a way to show solidarity while we are down there. We will be in Chapel Hill, a relatively liberal area of the state and were seeking an event to attend, but there did not seem to be anything happening while we were there.\n\nSome people had also floated the idea of showing up for a day of the event in drag as a lighthearted way to raise awareness for people who were local and to publicly show our support. My initial reaction is that this seems inherently... offensive? (opinions needed here). Unless we are representing something about ourselves it seems callous/insensitive for us to do this, especially knowing that we will get some laughs or eye-rolls from the situation, whatever our intentions are. \n\nI spoke to a trans friend who said, if you \"have\" to go, don't buy any of your food there or patronize any businesses. Its something worth considering but would have a significant impact in our regular plans. This is a 10+ year tradition for us, and while next year may be a fine year for a change, its too late this year to make alterations. Additionally its not as if Chapel Hill business owners are supporting the state's governor or electing representatives that authored the bill, as I said, its a liberal area.\n\nSo, what are my options? We have 8-10 mostly straight, all cis people who want to do something while they are in NC due to our discomfort travelling there but are unsure of how to approach the situation with the right sensitivity.\n\nHalp?", "date": "2016-04-07 19:21:21", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4dso3v/so_im_going_to_north_carolina_advice/", "author": "Hansgeorig722", "reference": 544}, {"title": "About medical check ups", "text": "Hello!

I want to be sure that whatever my opinion on these issues, it's based on as much information as possible. Here's how my position goes as of today: I'm of the opinion that if our current society (in the US) were more completely accepting of feminine men and masculine women, trans people wouldn't feel the need to transition, but would feel comfortable remaining their current sex while expressing femininity or masculinity as much as they want. For example, if a man feels very feminine and wants to express that, then in today's social climate he may decide to transition to female (which I fully support! Do whatever makes your life a happy one). But if our culture fully accepted femininity in men and masculinity in women, that feminine man would express himself as a feminine man, instead of transitioning to womanhood. Am I missing something? Is there something about being trans that I don't understand?\n\nThanks for your help everyone!

(which is ok I dont mind using it)\n\nShe sounded pretty ok with it, almost like she didn't really care to be honest xD. She just said she'd see me thursday and thanked me for helping her avoid writing up a new nametag. I feel kinda dumb for worrying as much as I did over this.

I have a regurgitation reaction when I try to eat vegetables.... well most of them, like broccoli, lettuce, spinach, etc.\n\nSo I guess my questions are these:\n1) Any tips on feeling more feminine?\n2) Any tips on targeting the stomach area without risking building up bulk?\n3) Any tips on how to start eating salads?\n(I figure this is going to be part of the stomach solution anyway)\n4) Any other tips/advice from trans women further along in HRT?\n5) Any questions you have for me?", "date": "2016-04-28 07:24:31", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4gsxlf/so_some_questions/", "author": "Ragnellrok", "reference": 2560}, {"title": "Incarcerated Transwomen On Strutting And Surviving \u2014 \"they feel more feminine when surrounded by men\"", "text": "", "date": "2016-04-28 17:00:01", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4guxgd/incarcerated_transwomen_on_strutting_and/", "author": "FuckApathy", "reference": 2588}, {"title": "2007 arrest of trans woman for using women's bathroom results in apology; helps change law", "text": "", "date": "2016-04-30 10:04:31", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4h3xi9/2007_arrest_of_trans_woman_for_using_womens/", "author": "pleasepeace2", "reference": 2790}, {"title": "I'm having the best day.", "text": "I'm feeling cute af.

Could I get some feedback?\n\n\"Possible incendiary post alert.  Thanks for bearing with the long post.  Lets keep it civil ya'll.  Couple of questions about bathrooms being non-gendered.  \n\n1)  As a mother generally unable to accompany your son (or more rigidly a father unable to accompany your daughter) into a public gendered bathroom, do you fear for their safety? And have you considered the ability to accompany both your daughters and sons (as is possible without gender segregation?) I ask because I have seen many a parent of both sexes nervously standing outside because of the social taboo of accompanying their child in a bathroom of the opposite sex.  I would think that the danger of an unaccompanied child makes a parent nervous, no matter the picture on the door.  A male predator in search of a female target would not lie in wait in the men's room, and vice versa for a male target.  (This applies to female predators too, but they do not seem to concern the general population as much.)\n\n2)  As for possible adult victims, I posit a similar question.  Do you not feel safer entering a restroom in a group?  A male predator looking for a lone female would not hide in the mens room, but would hide in the womens room to wait for her (same for the opposite situation, and vice versa for same sex attacks.)  So if a male and female (couple, friends, etc) had the ability to use the same restroom, would this not enable the possibility of a safer environment from predators?\n\n3)  If you have ever been in a non gendered personal environment (examples: festival showers, or ladies using the guys restroom while guys are there just because of an insane line, etc,) has that felt more or less safe than using a deserted facility that is (for lack of a better term) creepy?  \n\n4)  Do you believe that the non gendering of bathrooms is vastly more likely to encourage predators, or do you think someone who plans to assault someone may not care about a bathroom policy since they are willing to assault another human?\n\n5)  Do you believe that transgender people are more likely to commit assault? What do you believe differentiates this from the thought process that led to race segregated bathrooms, for fear that a black person was more likely to assault a white person?\n\nI believe that having friends, family, or simply more people around is more likely to discourage assault than keeping the \"potential victims\" in an isolated environment where a predator knows they have no \"guardians.\"  I personally feel safety in numbers, something present when girls go to a sketchy bathroom together but not possible when out with a male companion.  I believe families want to be able to watch over their offspring if they use a public restroom. I believe that the separation of the \"potential victims\" (women) from \"probable predators\" (men) perpetuates a dangerous rape culture.  I have used the mens room when the line was too long, and showered without fear among a room of all genders.  But thats me.  Tell me your thoughts.\n\nI am also confused where the line would be drawn, and how it is to be enforced.  What of those born with traits of both genders? What of those that have had sex changes? Does a woman with masculine dress, features, appearance have to present her \"attributes\" to gain admission to the ladies room?  \n\nOn the other hand, I don't care for my SO to overhear me birth a Chipotle baby, nor do men want to wait in line like girls have to.  So there's that.  Now go forth and fight, hordes of the web. Because we are internet, we are angry.\"\n", "date": "2016-05-02 10:23:03", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4hg45f/questions_for_those_boycotting_target/", "author": "thehydraninja", "reference": 111}, {"title": "Questions for those of you who have stopped speaking with your families", "text": "This isn't just voyeurism, I am strongly considering breaking contact with my own family.

I now help to train staff at CAMHS (started at the hospital I attended, now working with all Trusts in South West London, possibly moving to a bigger area/national later on) on how to best care for transgender young people. At this time I can only talk about my own experiences and those of two or three friends of mine, but would like to have more opinions/experiences to quote, to give the best advice I can. The more experiences I can draw information from, the better the training I can give, and ultimately the better treatment trans kids will get.\nYou can help me out by filling in this survey, or by sharing it round so I get as many responses as possible.

I already knew she's against being different in general, as dictated by her religion, but it seems that she isn't even open-minded enough to hear another side of any story. She completely glossed over the fact that I'm bisexual, and there's no way in hell now that I'm telling her I'm nonbinary, so I've chosen to ignore any comments she makes about sexual orientation and gender. And trust me, she makes a lot, mostly on the derogatory end of things.\n\nSo today, since I was already in a bad mood, she was able to reel me in. She says she has nothing against trans* but any discussion of it seems to get her goat. Her argument was that:\n1) She wants to be able to go into the bathroom without the threat of someone looking in on her in the stall. \n2) She's okay with someone that was born intersex choosing whichever gender they feel like, but if they were born with a penis, they're a man and so they can't change genders, even with operations and vice versa.\n3) There should be a third option bathroom available. (Which I agree with because why the hell not. What if a mother needs to go into the bathroom with her son, or someone has multiple kids and wants to keep them all together, or hell someone like me without kids just wants to go into a private bathroom.)\n4) She feels her rights are being violated by allowing trans* individuals to use the same bathroom as her. She feels they should have rights, but by allowing same bathroom usage, they are imposing on hers.\n\nI tried to explain that by just thinking in this way, she thinking of trans* as other and by very definition of her thinking, stating that we shouldn't have the same rights.\n\nBut I just stopped talking and listening to her after that last one.

Women and girls have experienced plenty of predatory behavior from cross-dressing and transgender males. In fact, they rape, beat and kill women at EXACTLY the same rates as non-transgender males. The problem is MALES being given the keys to LEGALLY enter women's and girls' safe spaces. They're bigger, stronger, more likely to sexually assault (98% of rapists are male) and transwomen are no different than other males in this regard. Women and girls DO NOT want naked male bodies in our showers, locker rooms, bathrooms, dressing rooms. If we didn't have a natural modesty and need female-only privacy in these intimate situations (e.g. changing into our bathing suits), we'd just rip off our clothes in the halls or next to the pool and flash the world. But we don't because we want privacy from the too-often predatory male gaze of strangers and we do NOT want to see his parts, either (thanks but no thanks, flashers!) Why have dressing rooms for women at all if you're going to introduce strange males into the rooms? Google: Paul \"Pauline\" Witherspoon Dallas Texas, Michelle Kosilek, Thomas Lee Benson Milwaukie Oregon; Colleen Francis Evergreen State College, Christopher \"Jessica\" Hambrook Toronto - there are many cases of male transwomen and cross-dressers sexually assaulting, flashing, even killing women. Please stop posting lies that hurt females.\n\n\n\nTHIS IS FROM THE EDITOR WHO WROTE THE ARTICLE.  FOR THE ORIGINAL ARTICLE PLEASE GO TO THE LINK ABOVE.\n\n\nSusan, thank you for comments\n\nWhat statement(s) is(are) falsehoods?\n\nThe data I provided is from the federal government. The claim by Dr. Jacobs was disproven via the letter from the Montgomery County Police Chief.\n\nI've never been in a dressing room, whether it is at Nordstrom Rack, Kohls, Target, Macy's etc, where I'm changing in from of all other patrons using the room. They are locked enclosures with mirrors. \n\nAs far as the items you ask to Google, \n\nIf you are suggesting these are examples of how a law providing a transgender person full and proper access to all of the fruits of life ensured by all citizens of the country, then I sorry to inform you they do not.\n\nMichelle Kosilek was married to Cheryl McCaul. Ms. McCaul was NOT murdered in a public changing room, a locker room, or a restroom nor as a result of a \"man\" gaining access to such a space because a law like this was on the books because no such laws existed in that jurisdiction when that crime was committed. Massachusetts added their law in 2011, 21 years after this murder, and it does NOT include public accommodations. Ms Kosilek transitioned AFTER convicted of her crime.\n\nColleen Francis:http://www.transadvocate.com/colleen-francis-and-the-infamous-evergreen-state-college-incident_n_10765.htm\n\nThomas Lee Benson Milwaukie Oregon is a convicted sex offender with a record going back 17+ years. It is unlawful for him to go anywhere children are congregating, regardless of what he is wearing. \"Clackamas County Circuit Judge Steven L. Maurer found Benson guilty of second-degree criminal trespass, unlawful entry into a motor vehicle and frequenting a place where children regularly congregate, which is a crime for predatory sex offenders.\" As with this law in Maryland, illegal acts remain illegal. In Oregon, laws are on the books to prevent discrimination for transgender people, and they too do not negate illegal activities such as those committed by Thomas Lee Benson.\n\nPaul \"Pauline\" Witherspoon Dallas Texas, there is \"nothing\" Not sure what you wanted to highlight, other than a tertiary source at best just repeating the same jumbled mess of words you are.\n\nNow, to Christopher Hambrook from Toronto. The ONLY information about this individual comes nearly two years AFTER these attacks occurred. \n\nThe Toronto Sun writes :\n\"Shortly after his mother died in Montreal in February 2002, Hambrook committed the first of his sex crimes by sexually assaulted a family friend\u2019s five-year-old daughter. While on bail waiting for courts to deal with charges laid for that crime, he targeted a 27-year-old mentally challenged woman, by sexually assaulting her in his home and forcing her to smoke a joint.\n\nHambrook received two years in jail for each of those crimes, for a total of four years.\n\n\u201cHe had no empathy, no remorse or understanding of his victims of his offences,\u201d Toronto psychiatrist Dr. Treena Wilkie said in her assessment.\"\n\nThis is a delusional and psychiatrically disturbed individual who clearly cannot obey any law. The presence of lack of presence of trans rights laws, did not, nor will not ever stop him as witnessed by the psychiatric testimony offered by professionals.\n\nThese laws Do not nullify laws against rape or assault. Never have, never will.

I've been verbally attacked because I'm a cis guy; I've had multiple debates (hell, one of them tonight, which led to this post!) where I've been dismissed and told 'cishet' is not an insult.

They came out as trans not long before we got together (we had already been friends for a few years), and has since been presenting very femme.\n\n A few months ago they decided to start hormones - but given the rubbish state of gender clinics here they got some estrogen from an older trans lady friend of ours (who is a general badass and kind of guide for younger trans folks in our scene) and more was to be procured online, along with anti-androgens, as a more steady supply and a higher dose. After just over 2 months on hormones (which they were feeling great about!) they ran out and customs issues have delayed more... It's now been almost a month since they've taken estrogen, and they're feeling shit about it. I know they'd been excited for the weather getting better and feeling more like dressing cute and stuff as their body changed, and they feel like that isn't going to happen, that they're backsliding and it'll soon be as if they never started at all. Coupled with their existing depression, and issues with their parents being unaccepting, this has had a bad effect on their mental health.\n\nIt was a rare sunny day today, and I woke and got up to find our housemates all in the mood to sit in our garden drinking tea. Knowing my partners insomnia and depression means sometimes they'll sleep through a fun buzz and feel shit about it later, I popped in to them in our room to see if they wanted to join us - bad call - I hadn't realised that they've actually gotten so low that they didn't want to be woken or awake (or alive really,tbh :( ) at all and have since been sitting in bed feeling like crap. I felt terrible about having woken them - and about how low they are generally.\n\nAs I said, it's warm, so I've been in shorts and a bikini top hanging about and doing things around the house, and have been also in and out to hang with them and see how they are doing.\n\nI was making some food in the kitchen when I got a Facebook message from them - asking if I could wear something other than my bikini around them today as it was making them feel jealous and shit about their body. I said ok, and am now wearing a tshirt.\n\n....but I am feeling *really* uneasy about the whole thing. I'm not going to raise it with my partner now - they're feeling so horrid and I don't want to add to that - people also don't tend to be their best most receptive selves when super duper low, so I don't think it would be productive from an \"us vs the problem\" standpoint anyway. I'm also not sure if this even is the problem I feel it might be - I'm hoping for some clarity here.\n\nI wanted to field some thoughts from trans folks, particularly transfemme folks, about the whole thing, and gather my thoughts. The thought that me being around my partner dressed in very little makes them feel horrible about their own (beautiful!) body breaks my heart - and the idea of them having to sit there feeling that way if they want my company when they're down is an awful one.... But like I said, it feels weird, and wrong. I'm well aware that it isn't *at alllll* coming from the same place as the impetus on women to cover because of the lustful gaze of men - but feeling like I should be covering my body because of anybody else's reaction to it, whatever it may be and wherever it may come from, is a profoundly discomfiting one.\n\nI'm trying really hard to be understanding. I'm totally open to the possibility that there's an element to this that I'm currently not seeing because I'm cis and my relationship to my gender and body is so different from theirs in this world, or because of my own emotional reaction to the idea of changing what I wear to suit somebody else(which I've only ever before encountered in the other form, the 'don't be slutty' 'cover your shame' form, so have a knee jerk defence reaction to)\n\nI have no clear ideas here, and no good answers.

My dad, bless him, has done his research and tries to call me by my name, but fails miserably in real life. The problem here is my grandparents. They pretty much raised me, I lived with them ages 3/4 - 10-ish, and after that I sort of became distant and it hurt them a lot. I didn't mean to, but it was because of their attitude towards everything. They're racist, homophobic and the worst bit, transphobic. When my grandmother was told I was trans she said I was having a sex change (as if it's one simple little snip) and that top surgery was mutilation (when that's the thing I want so badly) and it hit really hard. Obviously, they're old, in their 70's now. They have old fashioned values. They're from a dodgy bit of London and they don't like anything out of the ordinary. Okay, I've rambled enough about the background situation. The main problem is, my grandmother has pretty recently been diagnosed with dementia, and forgets things. She has forgotten I am trans, and my family won't help me to tell her. My dad got angry when I told him that her constant use of female pronouns, my old name, anything feminine towards me was hurting me so badly. He said if I dare blame her, he's going to get angrier. I live fully as male, my mum's side (parents are divorced and don't talk) all call me by my right name and pronouns and have been absolutely fantastic. I'm out at school and all my friends know me as male. I'm male in every situation but that phone call I am forced to do every week, where I am violently gendered and it hits me so hard. I don't know if I can do it anymore, but I know if I continue to not talk to them, my dad will get angry. Has anyone got any advice?\n\nTL;DR: My grandparents are sort of unsupportive, grandmother has dementia, forced to talk to them and be violently gendered every time when I am male everywhere else.

I say \"may\" because I'm still very unsure and conflicted over whether or not I truly am. \n\nI've always been a very solitary guy and I've struggled with social anxiety for a long time, but only recently have I started to think that this might be caused by gender dysphoria. For a very long time I've been uncomfortable and somewhat embarassed with the way my body looks, even though I know from an objective standpoint I'm not unattractive. I know a lot of people, even attractive people, are unsatisfied with their bodies look, but really I don't even think making myself look more attractive by masculine standards would make me feel any better. When I picture myself more muscular or whatever it doesn't really make me feel any better or encourage me, but when I picture myself as a woman I find it somewhat comforting.\n\nThe big reason that I doubt that I'm transgenered is that I don't think I've ever been able to point to any experience and definitively say \"that was gender dysphoria.\" I can't remember having any particular childhood memories where I felt compelled towards more feminine things (which seems to be a very common occurence for trans people from what I've read), and there's never really been a particular moment in my life where I've said to myself \"I wish I was a woman.\" I've read [That Was Dysphoria?](http://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms described there, but of course those symptoms don't necessarily imply gender dysphoria and could easily be explained by plenty of other mental issues.\n\nI recently \"came out\" to my girlfriend and told her about all of these thoughts. She was fantastically awesome about it and without any hesitation let me know that she was completely okay with it and would support me no matter what decision I eventually came to. It was extremely comforting to get this off of my chest, but more than just being comforting it just feels a lot less stressful to be around her in general since I told her. I've always gotten stressed out when being around people for too long, and while I know that's a very normal thing and I don't want to make myself out to sound like a special-snowflake type, since telling her I haven't really felt like I have to worry about acting masculine and it's been so much easier to talk to her honestly and without being stressed.\n\nAgain, I know getting stressed out around people is a normal thing, but at the risk of sounding self-important, I feel like the stress I get from being around people is more than just introversion. For my entire life I've felt like I was lying to everyone I interacted with, even my best friends and family, although I've never been able pinpoint exactly *what* I was lying about. I've often felt like I don't even really have a personality, I just mirror whatever the people around me are doing. I know that almost everyone acts differently around different people, but for me I've never even felt like I'm acting differently from my \"true self\" or whatever, but that I don't even have a true self to begin with. Only since I opened up to my girlfriend have I really felt that I'm not lying to anyone or pretending to be something that I'm not. I don't know if this is a result of telling her that I might be trans, or just generally being more honest to her about my emotions.\n\nMy girlfriend has been so supportive that she has even helped me try crossdressing a few times to see how it feels. She showed me how to put on makeup, let me try on some of her clothes, and even borrowed a wig from a friend to let me try it on. With all of it on I really did feel comfortable and calm, and for the first time I can remember I felt truly content with the way I looked (despite the fact that I looked far from perfect).\n\nNow to get to the weird psychoanalytical side of the problem; I've been struggling with whether or not I'm trans for months now and I keep jumping back between thinking \"I'm definitely not trans and it's silly to even think that I am, I just have social anxiety or something,\" and \"I'm definitely trans and I need to stop denying it.\" Based on this I think there are basically two possibilities to explain the way I'm feeling:\n\n* I'm cis and I'm just using the idea of being transgender as an excuse to have hope because I want to believe that there is a solution to the anxiety and stress that I feel constantly\n* I'm trans and I'm only denying it because I'm afraid of transitioning and don't want to ruin my relationships with everyone in my family and friends\n\nI'm not really sure how to figure out which one of these is true. I've done a bunch of research and the question of \"Am I trans?\" seems to be met by something like [this](http://amitransgender.com/) most of the time, but I can't just accept it that easily. I'm also fully expecting that the response to this thread will probably be \"Go see a therapist,\" but unfortunately due to the fact that I'm living under my parent's medical insurance that would require letting my parents know about all of this, which I'm not ready to do just yet. I understand that seeing a therapist is unavoidably the eventual outcome of this situation but I figured it might be worth posting this here, even if just to collect my own thoughts. If anyone can relate to what I've talked about here I'd love to hear about it.

It can be tricky because for insurance purposes, we need to use a patient's legal name and gender in their medical chart - otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues with billing, transfer of records and so on. My practice does a great job noting a patient's preferred name and pronouns on the chart, so despite the \"legal\" name and gender often being inaccurate to the patient's preference, we still have no trouble making sure we address the patient by their correct name and pronouns internally.\n\nWhere things can get tricky is if I'm sending documentation to another office. I think the easiest way to demonstrate what I'm talking about is with a hypothetical case.\n\nLet's say my patient Rose Smith is a transwoman whose legal name is John Smith (she hasn't gone through the process of changing her legal name and gender yet). She has a thyroid issue so we are referring her to an endocrinologist at a local hospital. She is aware we are referring her and she is fine with the endocrinologist knowing she is trans.\n\nThe endocrinologist will have to register Rose under her legal name and gender for the reasons I mentioned before (billing, etc), and since Rose has already scheduled her appointment this has already been done. In the endocrinologist's medical records, she is listed as \"John Smith.\"\n\nI now need to fax medical records over to the endocrinologist so he is up to date on her case. The printouts from the computer all list her name as \"John Smith,\" again for billing purposes we unfortunately have to use the legal name.\n\nI want to indicate on the fax that these records are for a patient who in their system will be named \"John Smith,\" but is actually Rose Smith. What is the best way to write the patient's name on the records to indicate this?\n\nOne of my coworkers typically writes something like \"John 'Rose' Smith,\" but I feel like putting the patient's preferred name in quotation marks implies that it isn't her \"real\" name.\n\nI personally have been writing it as \"Rose (John) Smith,\" which I think gives the patient's preferred name its proper place while also indicating the legal name to avoid any confusion or errors.\n\nI'm aware there are probably a lot of different opinions on this but I would love to hear from some trans folks on how they'd like this to be handled. These are documents that the patient is likely never going to see, but they can have a big effect on how the patient is addressed when care is being transferred from one office to another.\n\nThanks so much!", "date": "2016-06-08 18:18:02", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4n6hhl/question_for_trans_folks_writing_your_name_on/", "author": "AmadeusExLibris", "reference": 868}, {"title": "As transgender teens struggle, here's how one Kentucky school leads the way", "text": "", "date": "2016-06-09 02:44:13", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4n8vzc/as_transgender_teens_struggle_heres_how_one/", "author": "workerbotsuperhero", "reference": 929}, {"title": "A letter to those against the trans community", "text": "", "date": "2016-06-09 05:14:04", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4n9dab/a_letter_to_those_against_the_trans_community/", "author": "The__Panda", "reference": 946}, {"title": "I made a site for Gender Unicorn.

However, two of these issues, in particular, have been weighing on me for quite some time now.Yes, I am talking about my jugs.\n\nEver since these blasted fat sacks sprouted from my formerly flat chest way back in the seventh grade, I have been experiencing extreme self consciousness. Which, trust me, did not help with the already existing awkwardness of puberty. Part of this discomfort is from a physical standpoint, (Sports are hard when you're carrying jiggly-ass grapefruits on your body), but most of it comes from deep down inside. I absolutely hate having boobs, I hate the feeling of being sexualized by my breasts, and I hate not being able to dress in a way that empowers me.\n\nNow, I haven't really wanted to do anything about these odd feelings until recently when my well-meaning mother brought home a pair of target pushup bras and forced me to wear them. These damned things felt so uncomfortable and disgusting, especially in comparison to my normal sports bra. My mom proceeded to set me down and tell my that I had to start wearing \"real bras\" and that I had uni-boob. She told me to be proud of having boobs. This brutal honesty shocked me and brought much more of my attention to my body.\n\nTo cover up, I began wearing tight fitting camisoles, over my bra, to hold my breasts in place. Then, I would pick out the baggiest tee that I could find and slouch the rest of the day.\n\nTo this day, I hate my clothes, my body, and my outward appearance. I am sick and tired of feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin, and I am desperately wishing for a day when I can rock my favorite androgynous outfits without my damn boobs getting in the way. I long to move and dress in a way that makes me happy.

My mother was stressing this need relentlessly just so she wouldn't have to be my secret-keeper, yet when I decided to tell him, she flipped out because she was out of town and wanted to be there for him (would it really be that traumatic for *him*?) I'd already sent him a text saying that I needed to tell him something, but I recanted at her insistence. I told him I'd talk about it when she gets back.\n\nInstead, I messaged one of my sisters. I could've handled this better, but I asked her what everyone in the family (except my father, of course) already knew: \"Are you a lesbian?\" She said yes, and I came out to her. I probably shouldn't have asked this, but I asked if she could stand with me on this one. She declined, and I don't blame her. It's a lot safer and easier for her, you know?\n\nToday however she messaged me changing her mind. She'd come out with me. She'd outed me to my eldest sister, which didn't annoy me as much as it probably should. Probably because my eldest sister (a hardcore Roman Catholic) was nothing but supportive (of me at least, she was annoyed at my middle sister for not telling *her* this sooner).\n\nSo now my two sisters (I guess we're three sisters now? That's weird to think of) are coming to visit at the end of July. My middle sister is going to come out with me, and my eldest is going to stand in support of us. \n\nI'm a little overwhelmed at this. I don't know what's going to happen now.

Bro would flip his shit and tell me how stupid it is and how hard life will be for me, sis would accept it but would end up telling bro and I honestly have enough on my fucking plate to deal with than to listen to his shit.\n\nI have no idea where to start.

Let me start by saying, I'm a straight cis-male. The human in me loves everyone and respects the shit out of people for doing something about their gender dysphoria, but the scientist in me sees something wrong with our ideas about gender. \n\nSo I think that gender should have everything to do with physical anatomy and that matters of the mind should be entirely left out of it. Keep in mind these are all thoughts from my own meditation and research. Why do we insist on maintaining the male/female duality after consistently acknowledging the transgender community? I was thinking \"What if we decided to have 4 genders instead?\" Standard male/female for those with both male/female primary/secondary characteristics. But also 2 other names for those who retain their natural primary sex organ and change their secondary sex characteristics. Personally I feel like male/female have a strong purpose anatomically, but not so much otherwise. Gender dysphoria is largely a product of environmental influence on a persons growth. I can understand sexuality being a spectrum as I personally believe everyone is inherently pansexual. But I have a hard time seeing gender as a spectrum as well, since I see the two as entirely separate. The former dealing with attraction and the latter dealing with physicality...\n\nI know it's controversial, but I still feel like it could help with legal transitions for those who want to keep primary sex organs. \n\nWhat do y'all think? And if I'm entirely wrong... Could y'all help me understand gender as a spectrum?\n\n\n\nSomeone shared a video that helped explain the misstep in my logic..

Because I am only 18, they are gate keeping me slightly by asking for a recommendation letter. I don't need the full official letter, just a short note from my therapist. If I had pushed back, I probably could have gotten by without it, but to win the game you have to play the game.\n\nTotal Price including blood work (no T test): $190\nGeneral appointment charge: $100\nRequired Bloodwork (pineal, estrogen, basic panel): $90\nOptional Testosterone Test: $46\n\nRecently, I set up an appointment for an informed consent preliminary appointment at Healthy Futures for Women in Denver, Colorado. I had an interesting experience there, and wanted to share what happened.\n\nI called at the beginning of the week, and they gave me several options of when to have my appointment, 3 within the very same week. I chose one the following afternoon, wanting to expedite the process. The receptionist was very friendly when helping me schedule it, and even knew some trans terminology.\n\nI was quite uncomfortable when I walked in, as the waiting room only had middle aged women sitting around, some with kids and some without, and I am 18 yrs amab pre-transition.\n\nHowever, when I went up to the receptionist and told them my name and appt time, they were nice, and even asked if i had a preffered name (I'm sticking with my assigned name). I filled out paperwork for about 20 minutes, and the nurse came to get me about 5 minutes after I was done. I should also mention that appointment time includes check in, so you should expect to spend at least an hour and a half there if you are also doing blood work that day.\n\nI was led to a private room, and the nurse took my vitals and asked me why I was there. When i mentioned HRT, she was surprised, but just kept asking me normal health questions. Weird reaction, but she turned out to be awesome.\n\nThen Dr. Kate Weisenborn came in and asked me about my intent in starting HRT, and a bunch of doctor-y questions. When I told her how old I was, that created somewhat of an issue. she was immediately more guarded, and asked me if I was sure, and what I knew about HRT. I told her everything I knew, and about how much I wanted it, to finally stop the testosterone poisoning.\n\nShe left the room to print out the massive packet of medical information and all the consent forms. When she came back, she then asked me If I had been seeing a therapist about my gender. I told her yes, for a couple of months, but that he could't provide full recommendation letters, which is why I was going this route. Then, she told me that because I was so young, she was concerned about my decision, and wanted me to get a letter form the therapist. Not the full legal letter that's normally needed, but just a small note signed by him. Obviously, I was a mid upset, since isn't the point of informed consent NOT needing a letter? I could have pushed back, and i think she would agree if I had argued for it, but i was not it the mood, and I am pretty sure my therapist will be fine with it. She said that she would get the prescription ready, then as soon as they received the letter, they would send it to me. \n\nThen I got blood work done.

Yet I don't believe I fall under that category. Sure, there were notably strange occurrences during my early childhood that somewhat tip me off - such as dreaming about waking up as a girl, or writing about switching genders - but I usually dismiss them as childish thoughts.

I am afraid to even open my mind anonymously.\n\nAt this one comedy event I participated in, they has us dress in ridiculous outfits for a skit-like performance. So I decided to dress in drag and use the most feminine accent I could muster up. I don't know how to describe it, but I felt... happy? pretty? like I really belonged? I don't know. It just felt like I was myself, but yet I wasn't.\n\n*\"Soul of a woman was created below...\"*\n\nI identify as a straight male when ideally I would identify as a gay woman. yet strangely, I am comfortable in my current state. I don't want to be someone else because then I would be out of place. I mean, how would I even go about explaining these feelings to my parents, or others around me? How do I make up my mind in the first place? How would I start a journey that I may not want to finish?

I was born male and am currently living as a cis male but to understand my story I have to begin from when I was much younger.\n\nSomewhere around 1st grade I realized I was more comfortable being around my girl cousins I'd rather play with Barbies and doll houses than action figures and toy guns like my brothers. And my family never minded, I wasn't purchased any for myself but never scolded for playing with my cousins. And I began to realize I was different.\n\nIn second grade a new toy came out they were like mini makeup kits for girls to play with and boy did I want one. I saved up my allowance for a few weeks and asked my mom to take me to Kay-Bee toys to buy a toy. But when she saw what I was looking at she kind of harshly convinced me that those toys weren't for me. And that was the moment I not only realized that I didn't fit in with boys but felt that I needed to hide how I felt. \n\nLate in elementary school and beginning of junior high I began to understand that I had a gender identity issue but I was also painfully aware of gender norms and that if I came out of the closet I had a serious risk of being alienated so I kept it hidden. Even hiding I would often get picked on for being feminine and oddly enough the insult that was thrown at me that hurt the most was \"dyke\" because it was a reminder and a ridicule toward what I wished I was.\n\nWhat was both a blessing and a curse for me was that I was attracted to women not men. It allowed me to have a \"normal\" dating life in Jr and Sr high without outing myself. But I never felt 100% fulfilled. \n\nDating was also confusing for me because when I was younger it was really hard for me to figure out if I wanted to 'be' or 'be with' who ever I was currently crushing on.\n\nAs I got older and had serious relationships I would inform my significant other about my Identity issues and was lucky to be with people who were always accepting or at worst understanding never judged.\n\nFast forward to now I'm 29 years old living as a man, Married (happily I adore my wife) and a father(I love. While I'm happy with my life I sometimes just hurt over this. I feel I've lived as a man too long and couldn't handle the change.(I'm a creature of habit) but I always feel as if I live in a body that's not mine. \n\nMy wife wants me to talk about this stuff with her but I don't always feel comfortable. It's a touchy subject for me as it is and when she asks me things I feel more like I'm being interviewed for a mix of entertainment and self assurance on her part not for my needs.

For a long time, since I was a kid, I had this thought coming through my head every now and then. It said \"I'd like to try being a woman, I'd like to be seen as a woman, I'd like try all those ways of dressing.\" I'll admit, when I was younger I think I got a kick out of the idea of having boobs too. That's probably why it always seemed like a selfish fantasy and nothing more. So I ignored it. As I grew up I tended to pretty much rail against gender roles. I was bi, then pan. I didn't think people could fit into those boxes of gender roles. Unless they chose to anyway. Eventually I took up the term genderfluid. When something I saw was addressing women I could feel it addressing me as well, all of my feminine traits including me. It felt really nice to embrace them fully. That's where I've been stopping myself though. I keep my he/him pronouns and make firm note of the gender non-binary parts of that term. More recently I've found myself starting to think \"what if I'm meant to transition, what if that's right for me?\" I always stop myself though, say that I can't afford to think about that right now. \n\nTonight I had a dream. There was some god or magic person that could turn me into a girl and I took that opportunity. It felt amazing for a while until I triggered something that made me revert back. After that, I woke up. Then I proceeded to go back to sleep maybe eight times to go back to that dream and complete a quest to get back the body I wanted. When I finally did it, I looked into the mirror. I had my trademark unmanageably curly hair except that it was ginger this time. I worked into it with a brush for a long time until the top kept some craziness that could flow down into long, heavy, orange hair that fell to my waist. I looked perfect. I had my strange style but with.. something that wasn't there before. Then I let myself wake up.\n\nNow I'm sitting here in bed, finally ready to think about this. Maybe I really would be happier as a woman. I don't know how I would tell anyone. I have some friends who could help, but I don't really know how I would go about transitioning. I'm supposed to make it as a teacher, could I even do that as a trans person in today's shitty society?? If I started transitioning, how long would I be branded to so many as something wrong?

I finally hit that point where I am going to feel worse bottling this up than to just fucking deal with it.  I wrote my parents a 2 page letter, crying nearly the whole time, and sent it to them via my mom's Facebook.  Because of the time difference, I sent it at 3am their time and so she didn't read it til the morning.  Long story short, we talked for almost an hour and there was literally no negativity.  I'm not sure how my dad will take the news, but for now I have a huge part of this weight on my heart lifted knowing my mom knows and still loves me.  Telling them was one of the hardest things I've ever done.  I want to thank everyone who is a part of this community for always sharing and being so positive.  I'm on the road to being my real self, and I couldn't do it without so many amazing role models online.\nTLDR: I came out to my mom, she still loves me.

I'm new here and using a throw away account because I can't really risk posting from my main one. Just looking for some advice. I apologize ahead of time for the wall of text...    \n  \nSo I'm 22 and currently (outwardly) identify as male, though I've been fighting dysphoria more or less since I can remember. During highschool I 'came out' to my mother who, although supportive, didn't really understand and wouldn't help in any regard other than giving me rides to and from therapy. I only went to therapy for a few months before extenuating circumstances meant I had to stop, and me still being pretty young and frankly very scared, I stopped altogether.  \n  \nI had never started HRT but I had forms and some clothes I wore when I could but living with my parents made that very difficult. Over the years I just suppressed everything as best I could and tried to move on. I was doing fairly well (as well as I could at least) until last year when things hit me hard again. I went thru a short phase, now that I'm on my own, where whenever I was home I'd wear forms and whatever I was comfortable with for clothes but I since had a bit of a mental breakdown after a particularly difficult day and threw everything away :( Ever since I've had those ups and downs where I would get really determined and then super defeated.  \n  \nIn spite of this I'm slowly starting to try and face the problem again and work towards something healthy but when I look in the mirror all I can focus on is how 'manly' I look with my beard and being covered in body hair. I hate it. It's not me. I guess I just need some advice. Reassurance? I feel like this is an impossible task for me and I don't know if that's normal. I've never had any trans friends so I've never had anyone to share in the experience with.  \n  \nI appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and possibly give some advice and guidance. I'm just kind of flying on my own here trying to manage this and other stressful life situations.  \nThanks.", "date": "2016-08-03 04:36:22", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4vws0i/in_need_of_some_guidance/", "author": "throwaway_Aug2016", "reference": 193}, {"title": "Rocky Horror Picture Show", "text": "I want to start by apologizing if this post offends anyone, but as a cisgender gay male this bugs me; Why is Laverne Cox playing the role of Frank N Furter in the remake of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, and why isn't the trans community more upset about it!? \n\nI love the original Rocky Horror Picture Show, it's funny, its weird, and it's just horrible, but I hate that in the upcoming remake Frank is female.

Since then I've been embracing my feelings and I pretty much switch into girl clothes the moment I get home and feel happier than ever doing it.\n\nPrior to coming out I had been very depressed over the last year and really overweight. Nothing brought me happiness, I only looked for escapes and my feeling of dysphoria was worse than ever. Unfortunately one of the escapes and something that in a way was dealing with the dysphoria was watching porn. I've never enjoyed porn and in the eyes of my wife and I watching it is pretty much cheating. For some reason watching it made me feel feminine and kinda helped repress the dysphoria, but also made things worse, eventually I would just become super jealous of the women in the video for being something I felt I could never achieve.\n\nI admitted to the porn watching to my wife during an argument, as that escalated and I began to think why I was watching the porn, that was when I realized everything in the previous paragraph. It was never sexual for me, dressing up is never sexual, when I get to be a girl I feel right, more normal. I've tried explaining to my wife the porn watching was an outlet, but also a way to repress the dysphoria and now that I'm coming out I have no desire to watch porn. I'm happy that I get to start becoming a girl. \n\nI know this has been a wall of text, but I'm just curious if watching porn as a way to deal with the dysphoria is normal behavior from someone who is deeply repressed and in denial (should add that I'm from a small bible thumping town and a very conservative upbringing).", "date": "2016-08-03 17:43:07", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/4vzrgx/need_help_explaining_behavior_prior_to_coming_out/", "author": "Yourenotevenzealous", "reference": 249}, {"title": "When a person born male transitions to female, are they a trans man or a trans woman?", "text": "I'm so confused, honestly.

There's also a Pokestop and a gym there. I will sometimes walk down there, order a few overpriced drinks, and get a little tipsy as I spin the pokestop and level the gym (Go team Valor! ^_^) Anyway, as usual, I forgot my ID and this time they decided I couldn't order without it.\n\nSo I walked back to my apartment, and as I was walking I noticed a police car behaving oddly. First, it pulled over and stopped right near me. I hesitated, but they didn't roll down their window turn on their lights, or otherwise try to get my attention, so I just kept walking. This area near my apartment was a Y intersection and I was walking up the foot of the Y, with my apartment on the left arm. The police car pulled up, went down that left arm to the end (past my apartment) and I thought I was in the clear, but they turned around and came back. They stopped at the stop sign and just..sat there. Way, way too long.\n\nI was starting to get nervous by this point. I'm autistic and have PTSD from my time in the army, so someone clearly stalking me was triggering enough, but someone behaving in a way counter to expectations was driving me near breakdown. I was raised white, upper middle class, cis, and male, with \"neuroatypical\" being my only real point of marginalization. Of course this meant that I was taught the police are my friend, I should always trust the police, and if I have nothing to hide I have nothing to worry about. I've since learned enough about the world to question those assumptions, but I've never *experienced* it, you know?\n\nI took a shortcut past the police car and into my apartment complex while trying to act natural. That's easy enough because I do take the shortcut sometimes, just not often in heels. I went into my apartment to get my ID and it took me a minute to find it. When I came back out, my fears were confirmed and the police car was sitting outside.\n\nNow I'm going to give the officer credit here. From this point on he was very polite. Not perfect, mind you, but I could tell he was trying. He addressed me as...basically the original third option from Fallen London, \"Si...er...ma'...er...yes,\" which was amusing because he clearly was not referencing it intentionally. I corrected him to \"ma'am\" and he used from then on. He said that they were looking for a \"Troy\" who...again, he struggled before settling on, \"fit your description.\" He asked my name, I told him. I first told him my new name, then realized that might confuse the information he'd already gotten off his computer so I gave him my old name (I don't consider it a dead name).\n\nHe asked me if I lived here, and then asked me for ID (thank God I'd just gotten it!) It doesn't have my current hair color, let alone my real gender (2 years, 4 months respectively). To break tension I joked that \"The license is a liiittle out of date. I dyed my hair since then.\" He laughed, gave me back my license, thanked me, and we were both on our separate ways.\n\nI've been thinking about this incident and decided to post about it not as a complaint about being hassled by the police, but just an observation that this has *never* happened in my entire privileged life to this point. I've never been stopped because I fit a description. Up until now, I've been nondescript. And I can't shake this feeling that the Troy they were looking for probably looks absolutely nothing like me except being a trans woman. Probably black, just for irony's sake here.\n\nWhen you're used to privilege, it feels like oppression to be treated like everyone else. Is my sudden ability to \"fit a description,\" oppression, or just lack of previously held privilege? I don't know, but now I'm more wary of police cars. If it happens again, and I have a sinking feeling it will, next officer might not even try to be polite.

We have been together for almost 8 months. He has been on T for 18 months. Before I met him I had considered myself a lesbian for the last 15 years. I'm currently unsure what to consider myself now I am completely in love with this guy. I'm not usually one to label but I do have a rainbow tattoo that means Pride on my arm very visible to anybody who shakes my hand. I met him and my whole life has changed. We have both been married and divorced myself once and him twice. I have met his family and they are amazing I have never been so welcomed  by family before my whole life. He has three brothers and his mother and father. He has adorable nieces and nephews. And we have huge plans for our future.\n\nI have a question for anybody out there who is with someone who is trans or has advice... or just anyone with advice. I fell in love with him almost instantly. Even though he is nothing like anybody I have ever met before. I am very protective of him and his feelings which may seem a little odd. But one of the things that gets me the most is when people call him by the wrong gender or the wrong name. I know that for most it is still routine from the life he used to have. But when I heard today that his co-workers who have only known him as he is now... They have called him she. Even though he has been on T for 18 months he hasn't exactly grown as much facial hair as he wished he had. I know that he will feel much more masculine when that happens but until then how do I keep myself from wanting to kick the ass of someone who offends him.. knowing how he wished to be addressed and still going against it. (Not his family however when they still call him by his birth name or say she or sister I don't correct them but I don't change how I address him) \nI have never worn so many girly shoes girly pants and outfits and makeup and done my hair so much before I met him. But I have found that when I do he is called Sir more often and is gender dysphoria isn't so rough on him. He claims it's because they are paying more attention to me. And not so much to him.\n\nI know this is kind of a long post and thank you for taking your time to read it. I have a bit of a hard time with this stuff sometimes just because it is new to me 8 months is not a very long time. I am so in love with him. I just want to make it easier for him.

However, through all my years, I've become more painfully aware of the fact that steps toward aligning more with my gender identity (facial hair removal/body hair reduction/etc) are relatively impossible with how my body is. In short, I generally loathe my body, and it makes me very uncomfortable to be seen in it because I don't like the fact that people automatically associate me with masculinity when they see me.\n\nFor this reason, as I've grown older, it's become more and more difficult to actually get OUT there and do things. Being constantly aware that my body is not what I want it to be has led to an enormous amount of awareness of several things, but particularly, my issue here is this: I take up space and am ashamed of doing so because I don't like the way that I occupy that space. For my whole life I have done my best to make myself small and gone out of my way to never manspread or anything like that because I am all the more spatially conscious and want to be perceived as small, but being 6'2\" makes it very difficult to not be noticed, and it makes it exceptionally difficult to be seen as anything but male when everything about you screams \"MAN!\" \n\nI have attempted to lessen this masculine presentation numerous times through different measures, but my body seems to have some kind of vendetta against any kind of process that would make this easier for me. Laser hair removal and other processes like that do not work on my hair type, and despite all my attempts at minimizing body hair by other means, I've been \"blessed\"/(cursed) by remarkably fast growing hair that is noticeable even when I shave. (In addition, every time I shave I break out with ingrown hairs and acne flare-ups, but that's just because I have godawful genetics that lead to sensitive skin). In short, no matter what I've tried (clothing-wise or physically), I cannot minimalise my masculine presentation to a point where I am comfortable in my body.\n\nFor this reason, I have a great deal of trouble being in public spaces, because the more people there are around me, the more aware I am that I am taking up space that could be used for someone else, an the more aware I am that people actually notice me. I can't go with my boyfriend to clubs anymore because whenever I go, I immediately have to escape the crowded atmosphere because my self-consciousness paralyzes me. I would pursue less crowded situations, but in those cases, I tend to simply feel lonely. This has led to a worsening of previous depressive habits of hiding away and trying to not be seen or to go places where I will be seen, which is really hard for someone like myself who is enormously extroverted in nature.\n\nWhat I want to know is whether other people have gotten over issues like this before, and perhaps how I can work toward being more comfortable being in public.

We are even planning to start going to the gym together, anyway last weekend we went out in Boston, club caf\u00e9, and boy oh boy was he popular getting woofed at and bought drinks, proposed to (yes he's that cute) it was surreal, I stopped drinking after Cuba libre 2 and decided I had to drive and started eating pizza, FF to end of the night he's saying bye to a sweaty bear and passing out in the passenger seat, and hour drive back home. \n\nOn the drive I was using his phone for GPS and he's out like OUT, out.

My question is, \"By supporting the transsexual community, are we not also supporting the stereotypical gender norms that feminists protest?\"\n\nThings like how a women or man should act, feel, dress or think. That one must drastically change their appearance to conform to socially acceptable ideas of masculinity/feminist. I'm sure most do it for themselves and not to please anyone or get attention. As a fellow human I truly wish to believe that. But to say you identify as a woman or a man... What does that mean? Does saying, I want to look like a woman or feel like a man make any sense if you disregard the act of sex? \n\nI don't believe anyone who says they understand what a trans person is going through who isn't trans or a mental health specialist. How could they? I admit I don't understand what gender identity is and based on what I've read, you would need a degree to even begin to.\nI can understand homosexuality on a level to where I'll defend it. However when one gender says they want to live as another, isn't that purely aesthetic? \n\nHypothetically if a father comes out as trans and their child asks why their daddy looks like that, is it appropriate to say because that makes him feel better? If the child asks why again what would you say.\nI am in no way trying to say trans people shouldn't be parents or live a life they want to. A good parent is a good parent. I'm just calling into question the affect of a person changing their appearance to feel comfortable with themselves and accepted by others. Is one dependent on the other? If you truly did not care what people think, why would you care what you look like?\n\nShoot I'm all over the place. I have nothing but love for people who show me the same.

I absolutely cannot stand them and he has to have a label for everything. He's very much the \"out and proud in your face and if you mis-gender or call me by the wrong name I will wreck you\" kind of person, where I am more \"meh\" about the whole thing. I don't care if someone mis-genders me, or calls me by my birth name. Neither of us have started to transition and the way I see it is I'm not going to force my friends and family into this if they aren't ready for it yet, yeah it feels pretty damn good when they call me by my chosen name, and I was a damn near crying puddle on my birthday last year when my mother got me a card that said Son on it but I don't feel the need to enforce it until I start making the physical changes. My fiance though is on the complete opposite side of the spectrum from me, he completely cut off family and long time friends because they didn't \"snap to\" and start calling him by his chosen name the moment he came out (which I thought was utterly ridiculous). And I honestly can't stand a good portion of the LGBT community because of their \"in your face\" and \"oh you're not going to do this for me because I'm [insert label] well I'm going to blast you everywhere because you're a bigot for standing up for your own freedoms as a business owner\" attitude.\n\nNow my main question has to do with the fact that I HATE labels with a passion, so when I transition I will pretty much live a \"stealth\" (I think that's the term?) life. For me I DON'T want that \"trans\" title, I will be a man and that is all I have or ever will see myself as.

Nobody can debate that.  Personally, as a cis woman, I am proud to be female and embrace eveything that comes with our gender #feminism.  For a trans woman (and the inverse applies to trans men) you identify as female just as I do.  We are the same there.  Obviously you must feel the same solidarity to the female sex as I do.  But when you think of yourself and your solidarity with our gender, do you think your feelings are any different from mine?  I can elaborate: when you think of being female and being proud of being female, is it different because you are trans?  Do you feel pride in the fact that you are specifically a trans woman, or are you (just as I am) simply proud to be female?  Is there that (awesome) added level of identity pride bc of the LGBT community?  Does feminism feel different to the trans community?\n\nTell me if I am not making any sense and I can try to explain.\n\n&lt;3 &lt;3 Thank you for all thoughts if you feel comfortable sharing them!", "date": "2016-09-08 18:10:45", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/51soxv/a_question_i_have_for_the_trans_community/", "author": "Crentist_the-Dentist", "reference": 662}, {"title": "What are your opinions on Blaire White?", "text": "Just saw her on youtube.

I've suspected myself of having gender dysphoria for over two years after the recommendation of a friend, but have only recently begun to look into it and actually seek help. \n\nToo little too late. \n\nI went behind my command's back because I didn't want anyone to know, and have been seeking out help for the last few days. I had a psych evaluation on the 26th (still do I think). \n\nUntil yesterday my mom and a few close friends were the only ones that knew I was possibly trans. I say possibly even though it's there without a doubt in my mind after much consideration over the last two years only because I haven't been properly diagnosed. Gender dysphoria may not be the only thing that's wrong with me, as I have plenty of anger issues, and anxiety issues. Something along the lines of borderline personality disorder. Something that i personally (though I'm not a doctor, so this is just opinion) believe is not directly related to my dysphoria, while there are a lot of things that are associated with my dysphoria. \n\nAnyway the past few days have been really hard for me. Starting with my attempts to seek out help, I first went to the active duty chaplain, which took me two months to finally find the courage to go see. I didn't feel comfortable mentioning my dysphoria to someone religious, but I did understand that he was there to help regardless of the problem, so while talking to him, which was over hundred percent guaranteed to be confidential, I explained most of my issues regarding possible BPD. Fourty minutes in and he resorted to recommending me to mental health professionals, and I had only just began to touch on my issues. \n\nThe thing that had finally driven me to seek out help was urgings by the only friend I really consistently talk with anymore, who has had to deal with these kinds of things before with their trans sister. My other friends were all driven away by my out bursts recently. One of these friends, who I cared for deeply, was driven to suicide by my hateful words. Someone that cared for them was telling them to kill themselves. That's where I drew the line. Luckily they didn't go through with it, but they were staring down the barrel of a gun because of me and my instabilities. \n\nI went to see military mental health specialists, but unfortunately I was unable to see an actual doctor because as you can imagine the Navy and the military in general is filled with fucked up people, thus all the doctors were booked until the 26th. Life creeps up on you when you barely make 30k a year working more than anyone else will their whole lives over the course of a few years. \n\nI joined the Navy to \"man up\". To get stronger, mentally and physically. It's only served to do the opposite. I've always been a bit of a weakling, especially in my own eyes. My lack of masculinity was a crippling self esteem issue. No matter how hard I tried no matter how thin or bulked up I would get, though, I never was any happier with how I looked. Even dressing nice as a male was never really ever satisfying. \n\nSorry to change topics out of no where but I've been playing video games online via the PC since I was a teen. I've played girl characters the whole way. Not because I was a pervy kid and liked tits and ass as much as I tried to convince myself that was the reason, but it was because that's who I wanted to be. Video games were a huge source of escape for me. I was your typical computer nerd, as anti social as they come. In game I was bubbly and happy as could be though. If it weren't for my tendency to push people away I think I would have turned out to be a rather popular person. \n\nAnyway back to the main point. Maybe I'll edit this later and put more in. \n\nThe reason I'm on a hospital bed tonight writing this on a throwaway account is because I attempted to take my own life the night prior (the 14th). I didn't actually go through with it. All I had  to do it with was a knife, and when I went to cut my wrist open the long way, all I could do was scratch myself. I had lost all the strength in my body. The worst cut barely went into the skin and there wasn't even enough blood to be a big deal. My strength is actually still really questionable. Every day tasks are really hard for me, it's like when you're sick and your whole body just aches, and even just breathing is a chore. I tried to take a bandaid off the EMTs had put on my finger and I just couldn't do it. Or open a can of soda, for that matter. I'm not sure why this happened, and I sadly can't say that I feel fortunate that it turned out this way. \n\nIt's taken a while to get through my head and actually turn into something meaningful, but my co-workers and friends were up all night searching for me. I had utterly trashed my room and written in mustard (as I'm writing this it's hilarious thinking about it in hindsight) on the walls and floor, my suicide note. \"Fuck my command, I'm going to kill myself\".\n\nBy the way the reason I flipped my shit is because I had failed room inspection of my barracks room. Not that big of a deal. The room wasn't necessarily dirty, just could be touched up here and there. Not a big deal. I've failed one before for less, like not having my closet locked up properly. In hindsight it was really ridiculous to flip out over such a thing, and to the level that I did. \n\nI threw cooking ingredients all over, broke a lot of stuff including mirrors and drawers, and slammed holes in the walls. Then I sent pictures of the mess to someone that was actually at work. I took two of my old iphones, one 4 and one 5s, threw them in the microwave and took off to get some McDonald's, it wasn't but a minute or two before the fire alarm went off, but luckily nothing bad happened. I looked in the kitchen area of the building and the microwave was still there, so luckily nothing bad came of it. Anyway I bought like fifty dollars worth of McDonald's and gorged myself. Oh and while I was trashing my room I downed like an eighth of a bottle of Smirnoff that I had been drinking over the last month or so, pretty much just finished it off. Didn't even show up in the blood work. \n\nAnyway I went out into a field where there is an obstacle course and hid there. Had my fifty dollar meal, and subsequently tried to kill myself, but couldn't. I was exhausted from the experience, and opted to just go to sleep. Slept for a couple hours on rocks dirt and dead grass, woke up a couple of times and heard people looking for me, even saw a helicopter do a couple passes. Guess I had a pretty good hiding spot. Wasnt until about one or two in the morning until my co-workers found me. The guy that I sent those pictures to had made a pretty big deal about all of this. For which I hope I can find it in myself to thank him but right now I just wish i was dead even more than before. \n\nSomeone part of the LGBT community in our command, who I had reached out to anonymously in attempts to figure out tge Navy policies on transgender issuss, had even found out who I was (they knew who I was but didn't know my number and allowed me to stay anonymous)  and was also sending me texts throughout the whole thing. \n\n\nThe only person I really talked to through all of this was my friend I mentioned with the trans sister. They were worried. Everyone was. I hate myself for doing this to them. Over something so pathetic. And acting so childishly. \n\nIt was ridiculous how much they all cared. And how supportive they were of who I actually am. \n\nAnyway. \n\nIdk what the point of this was really. \n\nI'll answer questions if anyone has any.

We have ordered binders online. It isn't just a gender roles thing.  \n\nI think that it is trying out various aspects and is part of self exploration and discovery.  \n\nI try to reiterate that we are fine with whatever. Either gender. Neither gender. Bouncing about. But it feels like we need to do more.  \n\nWe do know that a childhood best friend (now a significant other) is FTM. We are pretty open. I grew up with someone who was transexual and had reassignment surgery (MTF). I have friends in many aspects of the LGBTQ continuum, but strangely not FTM. Her mother (not my wife) has a more diverse friend group than I do.  \n\nThat is a lot of detail. Most largely unimportant. Ugh. Sorry.  \n\nSo I am asking for any resources you could recommend. For any of us. Online as there isn't much in this area.  \n\nAny recommendations on how to make this something we can talk about. Talking in the car so we aren't facing each other seems to help a bit. Reiterating love and acceptance seems to be something she appreciates, but doesn't change her desire to not talk.\n\nLastly, binders are expensive. Daaaaayuum. Any advice on what brands or retailers would be great. Any advice on other things that might increase comfort would be great. So far just shopping for clothes I would have bought 10-20 years ago seem to be very popular (as does the resulting layering).  \n\nSorry it is a bit uncoordinated. Not sure what to ask, but I could use some help. Trying to let her take her pace for the last few years has not been productive.

We are both male; he identifies as straight and I identify as bi. The thing is we both have feelings for each other but feel incompatible due to our genders, and he stated that the only thing he felt was in the way was the fact that I am a guy rather than a girl. The dynamic of our relationship is very unusual. We've known each other for 7 years, going on 8, and I've always felt really close to him and like I could trust him. We tell each other everything and I feel safe with him and like I love him. From our conversations I've learned that he feels these same feelings, but our genders are a deal breaker. He told me if I wanted to become a girl he'd be interested, which brings me to my next point.\n\nAs a kid I remember feeling like a girl in a guys body but I kind of dismissed the thought because it didn't make sense. I never put too much thought on it but I am aware that throughout my life I've always wanted to be a girl. These feelings have been increasingly prevalent recently, but I understand that could also be because of the situation I previously described. I believe that my personality is also very feminine. So when he said that he would be willing to date if I could turn into a girl I became interested in exploring this further.\n\nI guess I'm really unsure of how to fully explain the situation. I am happy to provide more details if needed but I do have a few questions.\n\nWhere can I find more resources about undergoing MtF surgery?\n\nIs this a bad idea?

Whilst the argument seems fair in principle, its completely invalid because children aren't allowed to take Hormones.

I'm quite concerned about this whole thing because a majority of people watching that video will have come out thinking that kids are allowed to take hormones which just isn't true.

Ask yourself before you start hormones \"how do I deal with my feelings?\" Hormones are gonna change you sister. Tough doesn't stand a chance against estrogen. However as you break down and pick yourself back up will be stronger, emotionally. \n\nIs your partner straight? Your partner may love and cherish you, hold you close and promise you they'll always be there but they may not be able to change the orientation they were born with any more then you are able to change how you were born. If they leave, get ready to greave like you have never grieved before. Tears will flow.\n\nAre you ready to change? There are in fact some aspects of your personality that are gonna change as you transition more and more. Weather it be a reaction to your change in environmental response from coming out or your physiological presence slowly reforming, you will act some what different.\n\nYour probably gonna ask your self over and over if your trans, wondering if this is right for you.

I think most Transgender (that I've met) people have questioned hard if they're trans or not. \n\nIt's up to you to educate your health care professionals.

If anything I say or ask comes off as rude or insensitive, please let me know.\n\nI have a hard time buying into the concept of a gender identity. When it comes to sexual orientation, it makes sense to me that a human being can be inherently attracted to the opposite sex. Sex is a natural function and although homosexual sex is an evolutionary dead end, it makes perfect sense to me that a man can inherently be attracted to other men (and the same for women) without the influence of society affecting that feeling.\n\nWith a gender identity, however, you must first come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct, otherwise you'd be admitting the notion that gender is a natural state, which implies that there is a normal for gender (the normal being Man and Woman since those correspond with the two natural sexes). And if you say that Man and Woman are the natural states of gender, then you invalidate any idea that being transgender or nonbinary could be seen as a normal thing.\n\nHowever, if you come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct then you must also come to the conclusion that being trans is not something you naturally are, but rather an idea that you got from deviating from society's norms of gender. The reason I bring this up is because there's so much struggle that comes along with being anything besides the two popular genders. Why assign yourself as a label like \"Transwoman\" when you could instead just be \"A person who's a male that happens to like things society deems feminine\". It seems to me that there's no reason for there to be as many labels as there are when it comes to gender, since gender is a totally fabricated idea to begin with.\n", "date": "2016-10-26 04:38:19", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/59fpx9/a_few_questions_to_the_trans_community/", "author": "Kessiter", "reference": 2404}, {"title": "A few questions about gender fluidity", "text": "(General note: in no way am I trying to offend, I am willing to consider opinions of all, and I'm trying to understand.

I'm not the best at wording.\nBut almost every time I've seen/heard/read about etc people talking about what it means to be gender fluid, they basically say something along the lines of \"sometimes I wear guy clothes, sometimes I wear girl clothes, and sometimes I wear both\".\nBut those same people also talk about wanting gender neutral things and want to remove the idea of assigned gender at birth, and to stop dressing children in clothes that fit their 'birth gender' because they cant communicate their feelings etc.\nAnd isn't that entirely contradicting?\nMaybe I've just completely misunderstood and or I'm hearing information from the wrong people, but it seems as though the entire identity is based on gendered things, even though you/they don't believe in gendered things. How can you wear girl clothes and boy clothes, if they are neither? If you bought them, arent they just your clothes? Seriously correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm trying my best to understand it, but I find it difficult to undertand personally, because some days i wear dresses and some days i wear baggy shirts and jeans, but I don't feel as though I'm gender fluid.

In the past, with cis guys I've been with, the latter was really hot to me. Though I only get turned on when he sends me butt pics. His full frontal chest and v pics don't do it for me at all. I tell him he's sexy, which is no lie; objectively he has an amazing biologically female body. But he asks if I like/love his pics and I just tell him he has a hot ass. I don't know how to say that I would be much more turned on if he left a little to the imagination by concealing his chest and v creating the illusion he is cis. When it comes to the former, it turns me on more when he's got a shirt on and his briefs on with his packer in. When we hang outside and cuddle like that, it really, really turns me on and he loves turning me on, like a lot. When he's completely naked all the time inside the house though it takes physcial contact for me to get turned on. Even if he were cis, I find it sexier for a guy to wear underwear than to just be naked. But in his case, it would be sexier if he had a shirt and packer too. So my question is how do I broach the subject of what my preference would be without making him feel bad or screwing with his dysphoria.

He wants to satisfy me in everyway and physically he does. Visually, however is another story. I love him and don't wanna hurt him but I also want to be honest so that he can please me.

I hope this is right. Please let me know if somewhere else is more appropriate for this post. It's been on my mind since I first saw the show, and my upset hasn't gone away. The first night I was so furious I couldn't sleep.\n\n**Background:** I have been watching the A&amp;E show *The Killing Season*, which revolves around a series of bodies found on Long Island in New York. There is at least one suspected serial killer for four of the bodies, and all the identified women seem to have been sex workers. It's a secluded location, and the perfect place for dumping bodies, especially since most of them hadn't been found for several years. The viewer is led to believe this is hard-hitting journalism that does the work the police are too callous to do. This should be an expose, but falls flat on many regards (mostly the shoddy detective work and sloppy accusations). This particular failure, however, really got under my skin.\n\n**How this relates to this sub:** One of the bodies is identified as \"Asian Male\", since that body was the only non-white person found, and they had external male genitalia (hence the body's identification as male). I will use they/their pronouns. The whole show revolves around solving the cases of the white sex workers, and \"Asian Male\" is likely unrelated to the other bodies. \"Asian Male\" was dressed in women's clothing and was badly beaten, leading some to believe they were killed in a fit of rage by a john (It reminds me of the tragic epilogue to *Paris Is Burning*). At a certain point in the show, there is a promising lead for \"Asian Male\", but there is no sincere follow up. The show's hosts, who are supposed to do the investigative work that the police won't do for these bodies, just continue the cycle with their treatment of \"Asian Male\".\n\n**My problem:** My first issue is the continual referral to \"Asian Male\" as male. Add the possibility that they were a runaway for potentially being trans really breaks my heart, given that even in death, they are not being respected.  The investigators describe the likely murderer as angry at being \"tricked\" really pisses me off. When it comes to identifying the body, the sketches represent \"Asian Male\" with short hair and make no mention of the fact they may have identified as a woman. \n\nI don't know why I'm writing this, I guess I just want other people to commiserate with. Has anyone here seen this show? [Here](http://www.websleuths.com/forums/showthread.php?283332-The-Asian-Male) is the websleuths page about \"Asian Male\".

I DO NOT KNOW. At least if I had disphoria I'd have clue. So what is my situation. I'm 25. XY chromosomes. I feel fine with my body. If tomorrow someone would cut what is between my legs, I don't think I would be much affected by it. As it seems I never had depression, I never hurt myself (how could I anyway, it would have requiered my being receptive to my feeling bad. My parents trained me well, I was very cautious to behave as they expected, and I successfully ended up unable to listen to what I feel, like an empty shell, only receptive to anxiety and instant pleasure. \nA that time (15yo), I remember not considering myself as real person (feeling like an actual human being wasn't a privilege I had, I had to focus on my task of not bothering mom and dad anyway). \nWow I wasn't expecting to go that much offtopic, anyway let's keep on rolling, that closing bracket will come eventually, right? So yeah, my parents. You know they've never really hit me, I may have been slapped once or twice, but that's it. Nothing much physically hurtful, it was more of the degrading kind. God I was so scared to be yelled at. I was constantly yelled at. My mother denies it today like she doesn't remember, but I remember the feeling, the anxiety when I was hearing the door opening down stairs (meaning my dad was coming home), I didn't know if I was gonna be yelled at for something I did wrong or not. And you think what? That I would put effort not to get yelled at? Wrong! I could never do my homeworks. How could I? I was feeling like if I ever did my homeworks, my parents were gonna glorify themselves for having yelled at me to a the point that I did my homework. And everytime I was given detention, the anxiety was raging inside, because I knew I was gonna be bawled out. The degrading things I did or say to people, to avoid having my parents yelling at me. Respecting myself or other people was not something I had been taught. What I had been taught was focusing on behaving properly and fearing repression... except the rules were random, and thus behaving properly had no sense, so we can say that I've mostly been taught to fear repression thanks to my good friend Anxiety! So much abuses of power. And although I knew something was not quite well, I was not beaten up by my parents, that meant things were good, right? That's how you differentiate good from bad parents: bad parents beat up their kids. Therefore, mine were necessarily good parents, so things were ok. They're not evil you know, it's just that, my mother feels insecure and fears rejection (who doesn't) and thus needs to controle things a bit, and my father... well, it's complicated, I don't know much about his past, but he's certainly very concerned with his public image. And for the yelling very loudly, I don't why they did that, I don't think they were taking much pleasure out of it, they just didn't realize how destructive that was. They didn't congratulate me much. When I was bringing good marks, my dad was only saying: \"you could have done better\". Chasing after the admiration of a person who degrades you, how unhealthy is that? And about self confidence, that wasn't pretty, not many healthy friends around. About physical affection? Well not much. I mean, I don't remember my mother ever hugging me anytime, and I surely remember my being repulsive to my father touching me (no wonder where my today's urge for physical touch comes from). Still today, I don't know how to put words and talk about it. Also, I have a brother and a sister, and they suffered their own way of that education and are not fully willing to admit it (they are in good relation with our parents). The irony is that they used to make me cry all the time, and now that they put so much effort in locking up my heart, I cannot cry anymore. Okay, enough with background story, CLOSING BRACKEAAEAEAT). Just as a (self) reminder I was listing stuff that was making me doubt being cis, so let's carry on.\n\nI enjoy being around girls (I sometimes reach some ridicilous pick of urge to be surrounded with feminin energy). I find girls' cloth very aesthetic, I like them, I watch girls in the street and enjoy their taste and their way to dress. And about sexual orientation (let's put romantic orientation aside for now), I'm so confused. I'm so attracted to women (in a non sexual way)! With the girls I like, I want to share affection and huging and say sweet words and being kind and telling them that I love them, holding their hands. With boys.. that's the exact opposite. I would theorically enjoy sexual intercourse with a man (with me being penetrated), but when I'm around guys, I'm not that much attracted to them, or just a little, and if they touch me too much, I'm scared it sexual signals.\n\nI'm not sure I'm happy with my social status of man. I sometimes feel it when interacting with a person, the feeling that my being myself is limited. Let's say interacting with that person (let's call him Hector) is metaphorically walking. So, we walk for some time, and we arrive in front of the sea, Hector continues along the sea. Not me. I freeze and look at the horizon. There's something over there. I can feel it. It appeals me. I can't reach it, I don't have a boat. Then I realize that I'm awkwardly standing still, and I follow Hector.\n\nI originally just came to say that if I am transgender, I don't see how I could ever accept it, I don't feel disphoric enough to find the courage to make such a massive change in my life, and I find it a bit sad.\n\nAlso you people are very brave for stepping that step and for doing what it requeries to be yourself!\n\nCheers&amp;love ", "date": "2016-11-29 00:41:56", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5ffi1a/i_perceive_some_feminin_feelings_inside_but/", "author": "whyisyourskinsosoft", "reference": 2740}, {"title": "Hormone effects", "text": "", "date": "2016-11-29 02:44:49", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5fg4r8/hormone_effects/", "author": "ShaunaRocks", "reference": 2748}, {"title": "Hormone effects", "text": "Hey all, just wondering about the effects of hormones and when you will start seeing major results.

I grew up in a farm shooting guns, chopping farm wood, herding cattle and breaking in horses. \nI competed at state level for martial arts. I enlisted into the army and I'm a big, burly, muscular guy. I can defuse IED's, I can kill you with my bare hands, I can kill you from 1100 meters away and I can handle a guy thirty kilos heavier than myself. \n\nBut reddit, here's the thing. I don't know if I'm actually a dude. \n\nIt started off with realisations of small things. When I was a kid, I used to wear my shirt collar around my shoulder. You know how girls sometimes have shirts that reveal their shoulders? Like that. Or I'd sit like a girl, or I'd get ashamed for sitting in the toilet when I had to piss. Or in front of my dad, I'd say 'I want to be cat/wonder/bat-woman' and he'd be like 'son, superman.'\n\nSo I shrugged that off and was like 'alright, dad.' And went and did what he said. I want to be clear, my dad is a great guy, he was in Vietnam and he has taught me a lot about work ethic and helped me become who I am, but he's very old fashioned and probably doesn't even know what transgender is so don't judge him to harshly, please. \n\nSo reddit, it went a bit further from there, if you're still reading, thank you. But when I got older, I grew my hair out, I tried on chicks bra a few times, I used to make female gestures and cross my legs, walk sometimes, and even imagine being a female. \nI'd do this in private obviously. But my family started noticing my feminine qualities I think and started bullying me for being gay. And I came close to an emotional break down. \n\nI stopped, I 'manned up' and joined the military. I got my ass kicked into a man and I felt... out of place. Like when the boys are talking about girls and the girls they fuck and their carousing and shite, I just didn't connect with them. It's hard to explain, but it's like the voice in my head is a girls, not a dudes. \n\nEven now, I have a missus, and I love her - I'm going to marry her in the next two years. But, sometimes, I like to lay down in bed like a female, or stand like a female, or something like that. And it feels better. I imagine myself with a chicks body and it makes me smile. I like to use female avatars in MMO's and I'm writing a book with a female lead that I can kind of see myself as. In the first draft, I write her as a lesbian, I don't know why. I just did. \n\nIf you're still reading this, I have information that could lead to Hillary's arrest. \n\nBut here's the thing, reddit, I don't know if I amtrans.  If I was, wouldn't I be attracted to dudes? Or if I do trans, won't I stop loving my gf? I don't know if I have body/gender dysphoria so how could I be trans? \n\nI'm upset, I'm confused, I'm ashamed. I feel like I should do ... something. I didn't cry when I lost my grand father. I didn't cry when my family lost their family home. I didn't cry when I left home, or when I left the army, I didn't cry when I lost a string of other relatives or when I turned my back on my mother for being abusive when i was younger. I didn't cry when my father walked out when I was younger, but I want to cry now. \n\nIf you're still reading this, thank you. \nIf you reply, I don't know how to thank you. \n\nYours, \n\nThrowaway.", "date": "2016-11-29 13:54:39", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5fiqxt/i_think_i_may_be_trans/", "author": "throwaway34481", "reference": 2792}, {"title": "My friend is marrying a transphobe and I don't want to go to the wedding, but she's angry.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2016-11-29 21:26:06", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5fldzr/my_friend_is_marrying_a_transphobe_and_i_dont/", "author": "[deleted]", "reference": 2829}, {"title": "[Rant] Caught In Between", "text": "Recently I've been reflecting on how in so many aspects of my life I'm caught in between two things, specifically in relation to my gender identity issues. It's like when I try to hop over to one side I hear the other side calling my name. When I go to the new side I hear the first one calling me back and I just go back and forth like a pendulum swing. I was hoping to open up a discussion with others to see how their experiences relate and what they did about it!\n\nMost of them are physical issues. My body type is tall and skinny/athletic. While I'm certainly not muscular, I do have fairly good muscle definition and a somewhat broad skeletal structure. My shoulders are wide, my hands and feet are of good proportion, but I certainly don't feel manly. In fact, I feel quite small and feminine, which is why I suppose I have these trans thoughts and feelings.\n\nWhen I'm wearing men's clothing, this becomes uncomfortably obvious to me. I don't fill out my shirts because while my shoulders are wide, they are not big and muscly but small and bony. My hips and legs are small, and so pants either accentuate my skinniness or I wear baggier pants that don't look like they fit right. All of my long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts are too big by the cuff, and because I'm so skinny I usually can't roll up my sleeves without them eventually falling back down. Nearly everything piece of men's clothing I wear results in the disappointing realization that I haven't quite \"made it\" (as far as society is concerned) as a man. I've been able to, in the past few years, correct some of this with adjusting my posture, but that only fixes so much and it still just doesn't feel all right with me. I still don't feel like I'm in the right clothes. I don't feel comfortable.\n\nWell what would be the obvious answer? It would seem to be to wear woman's clothing. While I love the way I look most of the time in women's clothing it isn't always quite right. I feel comfortable, but not completely. I feel sexy, but not always. When I wear woman's clothing the exact opposite thing happens as when I wear men's. In men's clothes it seems all the feminine properties come shining out, but as negatives. In women's clothes all of my masculine properties come shining out, again as negatives.\n\nIn woman's clothing my shoulders are too broad, I have to cover up my arms from shoulder to wrist because suddenly they look like I've been lifting everyday for the past three years. My body hair comes spilling out of every spot not covered by clothing, even poking through my stockings. My feet are too big for woman's shoes, my hands too big to comfortably fit through the sleeves I need to wear to cover up my arms without stretching the cuffs. I feel like a big hulking mass trying to squeeze down into these tiny clothes. Maybe it's because I wear my girlfriend's clothes and she's a bit smaller than I am, but I know if I got slightly larger clothes the same issues would arise.\n\nOther issues I'm stuck on are things like facial hair. I grow enough for it to be noticeable, but it's not a full beard. When I have my \"beard\" I look much more masculine, and when I shave it I feel way more feminine, but never quite making the cut either way. Same goes for body hair, but who can keep up shaving your entire body. It's so time consuming and usually ends up uncomfortable so I abandon it until I hate the hair enough to Nair or shave it off.\n\nWhen I'm with other men, especially if they're not close friends, I feel small and meek. I feel in a sense younger than everyone else. Timid. Like they're all bigger and older and just more of men than myself. It makes me feel like I should be a woman, that I've no place in this world of being a \"man\". But when I'm with a group of women, I feel like the man of the group. I find my voice drop down low sometimes. I can't participate in a conversation how I think I'd truly like to, because I don't feel comfortable showing that part of myself. I feel like I don't belong, similar with how I feel with men, except there's nothing I'd like more than to just be one of the girls and join in in their fun and do girl stuff.\n\nAlmost everywhere I go, whoever I hang out with, I don't feel like I really belong. I'm currently working on being myself in every moment, and not feeling like I have to belong to a group or a clique to feel secure in my own being. I'm trying to not react to other people's energy that sway  me into behaving one way or another, but it's difficult because I'm afraid of the judgment that comes from people who don't get you. That's why I love communities like this, because while we're all different in many ways, we share many similar experiences, and so I thank you all for being here for each other when we really need it.\n\nThanks for letting me rant!\n\n~Christina", "date": "2016-11-30 19:32:37", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5frm43/rant_caught_in_between/", "author": "CallMeChristina", "reference": 2938}, {"title": "SILLY QUESTION: FTMs and MTFs of r/trans if you could swap your bits with someone else's would you?", "text": "Imagine if a list existed where ftms could partner with mtfs (and vice versa) to 'swap'!

I come here, after reading a bit, with some questions.\nIn advance, I would like to apologize if any of my views or arguments come off as offensive. This is not what I mean with this post.\n\nFor some background, I am cis-male, 25 years old.\nI'm not sure(As many other users on this subreddit and other sites) if I may be transgeder, or if I just like the idea of crossdressing, be it because I find femenine clothing more appealing, or because I maybe want to be a girl.\n\nNow, I don't have any kind of dysphoria, and I am quite happy with my body. But I always liked better the idea of being a girl. Traditionally girly things were always more appealing to me(And still are). Whenever I get to pick a character, I go for the girl, be it in videogames, LARP, tabletop RPGs...\nThis alone could mean literally nothing, and I know that. But since I hit puberty, I've been feeling a sense of longing, wishing I was born female instead. And the feeling doesn't go away.\nI crossdress whenever I'm home alone, and I love every second of it(Although I'm affraid to go outside wearing skirts/dresses and such).\n\nThere's one thing that keeps pushing me back from even considering transitioning, and that is that our current medicine and technology wouldn't allow a full transition, as I'd like it to be. Some sort of brain transplant, for instance, where my mind is fully realocated within a female body. That would be perfect, although unrealistic.\n\nNow comes the problematic part of this post, but please, bear with me. And if I'm wrong(I'm pretty sure I am!) please, do tell me. As I see it, transitioning is incomplete. No one can fully transition from their physical sex to another one.
