Like those scene boys from 2007, you feel? Take away the \"rawr lol xD\" part and I shamelessly wish I looked just a *bit* more like them.\nBut of course there's a certain inherent genderqueerness in that that makes me not a \"full\" boy.\n\nThen there's the body dysphoria. Frankly, right now, its the most present kind of dysphoria I have and it won't go away. As for my breasts I'm torn between keeping them and working towards a mastectomy but I'm not sure; I already bind pretty much all the time so it's not like there's much of a point in keeping them, but sometimes I still want to keep them and I'm not sure if it's real or if I just like how they look or something else /shrug emoji\nTheeen there's the bottom dysphoria and that is *much* stronger. I want a dick, and its really as plain and simple as that. Out of this whole mess of confusion I've been dealing with for a year, if there's one thing I can wholeheartedly take from it it is that *goddamn I wish I had a dick.* A lot of the time I pack and honestly its a little embarrassing to admit I like to shove a sock down my pants but for me it's pretty helpful. That and pretty much whenever I think about having any kind of sex with anyone, like ya do, I imagine myself with a dick almost all the time.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I'm not a boy. In terms of my *body* I might have leanings towards something more male, but in every other aspect I'm pretty much entirely androgynous.\nWhat I want to know if I should try going on T. Maybe not now, maybe not for a long time, but if I'm going to do it eventually I might as well start working towards it now (especially since my country supposedly might have just taken away my healthcare what up lmao)\n\nedit: words\n\n", "date": "2017-01-01 15:13:45", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5lfhi3/should_i_do_t/", "author": "aspenfires"}, {"title": "Questions about Kaiser California's HRT", "text": "I've heard kaiser california uses the informed consent model for HRT.

I'm a little old to be questioning things now but whatever, it's happening. I was born female and always liked more \"boy\" things growing up. I liked more gender neutral clothing and liked to keep my hair short. When I was in middle school I got asked a lot if I was a boy or a girl and I started feeling ashamed. I kind of just accepted I was a girl and tried my best to conform to femininity. I was never very good at it though. I always had my best girl friends dress me up and put makeup on me. I never liked any of that but I did it to fit in. \n\nAs far as my sexuality, I would be into girls when I was growing up but always called it \"girl crushes\". I suppressed my sexuality as well as my gender through my teen years and my 20s. Growing up Mormon would do that to you. I married a man when I was 22 and I'm still married to him now. I told him a few years ago I am bisexual (actually ended pansexual in nature) and we opened our marriage so I could explore that. Currently I'm in relationship with another man as well as a trans guy and I'm in love with all 3 of them. \n\nMy trans boyfriend has opened my eyes to finding my own gender identity. I still identify as female (it's just easier that way at this point) but I don't feel feminine at all nor do I feel masculine at all. I'm somewhere in between. I could care less about what kind of genitalia I have and half the time I love my boobs and half the time I don't. It's weird going through this in my 30s. Shouldn't people know who they are by now? Also my husband is cishet so I'm worried what will happen there if I start presenting more non-binary. Luckily he doesn't expect me to wear makeup and wear dresses and he likes my short hair. \n\nI wish I didn't care what people think so I can explore my gender or maybe lack of. Any advice at all?

About a year and a half ago I came out as trans and ID with male pronouns and am now read as male in a lot of my interactions in public. We've been through a lot together and we both see how we are similar and different that we thought (we've been together 12 years and still learning new things every day). People used to see us as a couple or arty-butch lesbians, though we both just kind of saw ourselves as non-gendered and would rather not think about it much.\n\nOne problem that we run into a lot these days is that people are adapting to my new pronouns and identity but my SO's NB identity is getting made more invisible in a way because people place them as the \"she\" to my \"he,\" something that makes my SO extremely uncomfortable. For example, we get introduced or referred to in a binary pair, such as \"aunt and uncle,\" or \"mr. and ms.\" While I get my gender affirmed, they get mis-gendered and they feel it more directly when its put in binary contrast like that. And besides, its downright silly for anyone to think of us as straight.\n\nIt's hard to know how to correct people because familial terms and honorifics are still so gendered. For me, when I get \"ladied\" or \"ma'amed\" I just say, \"I'm a guy\" and that works for me, but that isn't a meaningful option for my SO. So if we get \"ladied\" together, and I only correct the person about my pronouns/gender, I feel like I'm leaving my SO out to dry.\n\ntl;dr I'm looking for advice about ways I can help affirm my SOs non-binary identity when they or we get mis-gendered by friends, family, or in public.

I like my body a lot as it already is, buuuuut... I was thinking I want it to look a bit more feminine. I've never been too concerned about fitting into gender norms, personally, as I've never felt like I've fit that great into them anyway. I've pretty much considered myself as a guy, but about a year ago I started crossdressing as a sexual thing, and I started really getting into it. In fact, the thought of going out dressed as a girl sounds like it would be a lot of fun, not just something sexually arousing. Edit: I also started shaving my body hair about a half a year ago. Again, it started out as something sexual, but it just feels... right. So I do it on the regular.(edited) At the same time though, I normally wear boys clothes, and those feel right on me too. In fact, I really love wearing suits. I find that my body looks good in both suits and skirts and blouses, which is something I love~ Basically, I think I might be androgynous, or bigender, or something, but I'm not really sure. Maybe I'm just a girly cis guy? I dunno. My second question is this: what would you guys recommend for someone who wants to have a body shape that's a bit more feminine, without putting myself at heavy risk of becoming sterile? Is that something I'd just have to live with if I started taking estrogen? Is it possible to take it in small doses and not risk any of the issues with my testicles? Or, at the very least, to keep those down to a minimum? Also, would the supplement pueraria mirifica be something of a good in-between for me? If anyone wants to see pics as a reference, or to evaluate me in terms of masculinity/femininity (because i'm not good at explaining :P) please let me know. I'm 5'5\", 180 lbs, and about 44\" on my hips. I look ridiculous with facial hair. My main goal is to get more feminine hips, but I'm not that interested in breasts, although I wouldn't mind a bit of breast growth.

I have severe dysphoria surrounding my chests since they started developing in puberty. I am finally starting to come out as trans to people and am planning to have top surgery in the next few months. I have a fairly small chest, 32B. However, due to congenital scoliosis one breast is a B the other an A. My boobs also have literally zero sagging and I have only been binding (not that often either) for a few months. I have been assuming i would be a good candidate for peri or keyhole, especially my smaller breast. \nI have a friend who is a transman and he recommended I see his surgeon, Dr. Dulin. I went with him to the free consultation. I liked Dulin but man he did not want to do ANYTHING but DI. He also admitted my smaller breast was perfect for keyhole but just wanted to go ahead and chop off that nerve anyway. They acted surprised I cared so much about nipple sensation and like it was just no big deal. Here's the thing, I don't care about scarring but I REALLY don't want to lose all sensation in my nipples by having them grafted back on. Like it terrifies me and also seems so unnecessary due to my chest size. When I kept asking if there were other options I got little response. He said I probably wouldn't like how my chest looked if he left tissue anyway. But what does that mean? Sounded like he's only used to transguys who want like beefcake pecs or something? Anyway, I left feeling a bit disappointed...\nI want to consult another surgeon. I feel like it was a good learning experience though. Seems to me if a surgeon specializes in a certain technique, they seem to only want to use that technique, regardless of whether it's really appropriate for the patient or not.\nMy question is any nonbinary folks who've had top surgery? Who did you go to? Did you retain nipple sensation? Did you like the experience? Did they understand how nonbinary top surgery could differ from top surgery for a transman?\n\nThanks", "date": "2017-01-15 06:42:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5o2kvr/agender_shopping_for_top_surgery_advice/", "author": "ceruleannymph"}, {"title": "My boyfriend put makeup on me for the first time!", "text": "", "date": "2017-01-16 00:08:48", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5o7fzh/my_boyfriend_put_makeup_on_me_for_the_first_time/", "author": "MercenaryPsyduck"}, {"title": "Assholes", "text": "", "date": "2017-01-17 08:21:22", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5ogxda/assholes/", "author": "LordStudz"}, {"title": "A New Gender", "text": "", "date": "2017-01-17 17:47:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5ojhwv/a_new_gender/", "author": "scottambrose10"}, {"title": "NB in the workplace ?", "text": "What's your experience as a non-binary person in the workplace ?

I'm a very performatively 'bro-y' guy sometimes and have a lot invested in the masculine friendships in my life. That being said recently I had an experience where there was a college drinking game type thing with a team thing split along gender binary lines (boys vs girls) and to make up the numbers some of the guys had to be on the girls team. I don't consider myself to incorporate any feminine aspects to my gender identity, and being lumped in with the girls was definitely incorrect, but I was hit with a sudden \"Whoa\" moment where being separated out from the guys along gender lines felt \"right\" in that \"Holy shit, I never realised I'd been carrying that heavy thing until I dropped it\" kinda way.\n\nTBH it was a weird situation all round, and alcohol was involved and I was more than a little fucked up by the experience so I did the oh-so-healthy thing of burying it for months and months but it's one of those \"You can't un-know it once you know it\" things that's been bubbling up for a while.\n\nSo my feelings on the whole thing: I don't think I'm female, but if all my bros are 10s on the \"how male are you?\" scale I am definitely (probably? I don't know, this is confusing) not. I'm not 0 either though, and I'm pretty sure on the \"How female are you?\" scale I'd be a 0. So... is that a thing? Anyone got a clue what I might be?

She basically said that *she* felt uncomfortable with *me* being uncomfortable around \"other men.\"  She said that she's friends with guys who are way more masculine than those people at the party, and that me being uncomfortable made her feel bad for having friends like that...\n\nShe basically wrote off my discomfort around these guys as me being uncomfortable with myself, as if she thought that I didn't feel \"manly enough\" in comparison.  But that's not at all what was going on.  \n\nI feel like I should end this post here because I'm ranting...if I can clear anything up about the situation, please let me know.  I would really appreciate some feedback, so let me know if you feel similarly or know what I mean.  This has been bothering me a lot recently.

It first started with noticing how uncomfortable I was having a feminine gender expression. I forced myself to be somewhat high maintenance. This to me was wearing long weave, doing my nails, wearing makeup, dressing up etc.\n\nWhich was nice and sometimes I felt okay. But underneath it all, I had terrible self esteem. I was convinced I was huge in terms of size, felt really self conscious and didn't really see what people saw in me.  I was also diagnosed with body image distortions by a therapist (which I wonder at times if that was actually body dysphoria?).\n\nSo I realised how tired I was with how I presented, something was making me tired. I decided to make a decision to not conform to societal norms for women. Something I really advocate. But my questioning and conclusions didn't stop there. \n\nI dated someone recently, who was transgender. During that time I used to compare myself to them, was really curious about their transition. I watched and researched people who were transgender, thinking I was doing this to be a supportive cis friend. \n\nHowever, I subconsciously started to apply these ideas to myself. Would I live as male? Would I identify as male? Which my answer at the time was, \"well, yeah\". That night I concluded that I was a trans guy with little dysphoria. \n\nSince then, I have been having this constant internal conflict. There's not a day gone by that I don't think about my gender. Am I am a man or a woman. Am I comfortable being perceived as either or both? What kind of discomfort do I have gender wise, and in what ways etc. \n\nI have since presented more masculine, immediately my being self conscious has reduced somewhat. I now have a healthier relationship with my body, possibly because I contemplated taking testosterone (and still do sometimes). This forced me to contemplate my body a lot. \n\nI've been researching a lot of gender identities and think that non-binary transmasculine fits me. I feel that my gender identity is mostly neutral but also masculine. In that, I feel I identify as a person (agender) and a guy (male). I have thought about how my personality does not reflect my gender, neither does my gender expression. Despite behaving and dressing more masculine, it feels like something is still missing somehow. \n\nI constantly have doubts. Am I doing this for attention? Is my depression (which I am getting better with) causing me to want to reinvent myself somehow? Am I doing this to deal with the rejection of a break up for some crazy reason? \n\nI have these doubts even though I educated myself on the consequences of what this all means, how my life and relationships with people would change if I came out and if I am right about this. \n\nAny advice would be great, as you know, it is hard sometimes to work through something alone.

But I'm really struggling to figure how I want to identify, because it seems pretty essential to the whole \"coming out and living your dreams\" kinda deal. I'm AMAB and have really never connected with masculinity. Thats not to say that I didn't connect with my male friends, because I did have lots of cis male friends growing up many of whom are still good friends of mine. But masculinity as a whole has always seemed like something I don't want to inhabit, for instance I've had penetrative sex once, and I really didn't like filling that role. Currently my partner is the only one  who knows that I'm gender queer, I dress en femme with her quite frequently and sometimes we even go out and party when I'm dressed up, which always leads to an incredible night for both of us. I think at this point she thinks that I'm a trans woman, I'm not sure she's right, but I'm also definitely not sure she's wrong.\n\nI don't have the worst body dysphoria, I think my issues with my gender is based more off of the way my body causes me to be perceived and therefore how I interact with the world as opposed to how it feels on my body. I've been thinking about coming out as non binary and using they/them/their pronouns, but I kind of want to reach the point where I'm perceived by strangers as female. I think that I still want to take hormones, but use they/them/their pronouns and identify as genderqueer. I've spent so much time and energy trying to end my subscription to masculinity, why would I immediately pick up another subscription?\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with this kind of identity? Maybe you thought you were trans at one point but identify as non-binary now or vice versa? Does anyone have any experience taking hormones without identifying as trans? Is it reasonably possible to be prescribed hormones without having horribly crippling body dysphoria?\n\nThanks everyone, I look forward to hearing your response! &lt;3", "date": "2017-02-15 21:34:01", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/5uag2b/at_a_pivotal_point_in_my_life_and_i_need_some/", "author": "__River"}, {"title": "Good Internet sex dating with a lot of girls.

Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel.\n\nIf you do decide to transition, please don't feel pressured into doing things you don't want to do.

I think I mostly just need to ramble, but if anyone wants to share similar experiences or offer opinions that would be great!\n\nBasically, I've had dysphoria since I hit puberty. But even before that, I was weird about gender. Reading trans stories, I never felt trans, but I wished I was because that would give me a reason to want to get rid of my boobs. I've never liked them, and for the last couple of years I've also wanted HRT. I actually learned of puberty blockers when I was like 15, but I never really asked my mum about them?? I was so depressed already, I think I just thought \"oh, she'd never agree\" then went back to my 24-7 brain fog (not to mention I was already pretty \"developed\" and felt it was too late).\n\nNow I'm 19, and I live with my mum, who makes unintentionally hurtful comments but would never kick me out. I live in Australia, where transition is affordable for me. There's a good-sounding clinic that could be closer, but is reachable. But I'm just too scared to make an appointment? I wish I could just go there once, get a HRT prescription and be done with it. But it requires a GP referral, then several therapist appointments, then blood-work. The sooner I get it started, right? But to get it started I need to call the place, which terrifies me. I keep trying to tell myself it's my subconscious telling me not to transition, but I know it's not true. I'm autistic, I have severe social anxiety, I've had no friends since I was 12. It's the idea of calling.\n\nBut I feel like calling would be a mistake? There's all these tiny reasons that add up. Just when I reached 18, I finally liked wearing dresses and stuff (I'm afab). But I'd be too scared to wear them if I looked like a guy. I'm already hairy as fuck and don't want to be hairier, or bald (but I like all the other effects of HRT). I'll spend hours looking at binders online, then chicken out (\"I've never bought anything online, and they take so long to ship anyway it's not worth it\"). And since 18, I've hated my boobs slightly less. I think I may be genderfluid? Although I only feel like my assigned sex like once every few months, for half a day at best. Mostly I feel neither male or female. I think I'd be okay to pass as a guy, but paradoxically I don't want to bind, even though I want my boobs gone. As my mum's said, I'm a \"pretty girl\" but I'd be a short, ugly guy... which I wouldn't mind if I'm really trans, but what if I'm wrong?\n\nBeing trans is also embarrassing! I had the whole \"maybe I'm a trans boy\" convo with her when I was 15, she now knows I'm nonbinary, but I really can't discuss it with her because of the disgusted way she speaks of it. She thinks she's supportive, but her most supportive advice has been \"try dressing as a girl for a year, since you've never really tried being a girl, then try being a boy for a year!\". She's always there for me, but she is the opposite of what I need for trans matters. The idea of trying to talk to any family, or even a stranger who's a doctor is so embarrassing.\n\nI constantly feel like I'm running out of time. I feel the days go by without me while I browse the internet mindlessly, ignoring my problems. I've always ignored problems rather than solved them. I leave work to the last minute. I take literal hours to get out of bed, even after I've woken up. I wish I had gone on HRT younger (all my immediate afab family are tall and big nosed! Not me!) I used to write stories all the time. Now I have heaps of stories in my head of nonbinary characters that struggle with acceptance but realize they're trans. My brain trying to tell me something? Or my brain trying to fill the friendless, empty-of-personality gap? Have I taught myself to be nonbinary, or am I living vicariously through my characters?\n\nI'm autistic. My mum says I'm young for my age. When I was younger, I said repeatedly I didn't want to grow up - a fear of adulthood, or womanhood, or both??? I spent a year at uni, hoping I would feel like an adult and gain the self-knowledge to know if I truly am nonbinary. I joined clubs, didn't really talk to anyone, still feel like a child. The idea of all the paperwork of name changes and such exhausts me. I spend hours mindlessly browsing the internet about non-trans things. Then I spend hours reading other trans peoples' stories, or name lists, or binder websites.\n\nI always leave schoolwork to the last minute, but the work stays on my mind constantly. Being trans feels the same way? But I'll think \"ugh, my boobs feel weird today\" then I'll go \"do I really think that? Or am I just trying to convince myself I'm nonbinary? One time I wore a great bra that made them look big but also held them securely so that if I didn't see them I didn't feel them at all, and I felt great!\" I just want a personality outside of being nonbinary.

For context, I'm AFAB. \n\nThe first time it came up was when I was 14 and found out about androgynous fashion - I thought it was cool. I started dressing more androgynously, and started wondering if I was transgender. I thought about whether or not I wanted to be perceived as a guy, thought about transitioning (and wasn't sure whether I wanted to or not) but eventually it just left my mind. I didn't force the thoughts out or anything, I just stopped caring and was content with being seen as female again.\n\nAbout a year and a half later, (and this is going to be a bit embarrassing) I was reading a yaoi fanfiction and thought, \"damn, I wish I could do that\" (in regard to penetrating someone) and then the thought crossed my mind, \"well shit, what does that mean?\" and thence started months of gender questioning and intense anxiety. \n\nEventually it mostly went away again, and I was starting to feel more comfortable being seen as a woman, but then it came back again about a month ago.\n\nThroughout this whole period, 'non-binary' has probably been what seems the most likely, but even then, I have doubts. Am I cis? Am I non-binary? Am I ftm? All these questions surround my mind and stress me out.\n\nI'm pretty sure that I'm not FtM for a few reasons - whenever I get gendered as male in public, it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I've spoken to my doctor, my psychologist and my FtM friend about all of this, and from what I've told them, none of them feel that I am a FtM transgender person. Before all the questioning started, I was quite comfortable with my body and even wanted larger breasts. I was excited when I got to wear a proper bra for the first time because it made my chest appear larger. I would also try to achieve this through aloe vera gel massages. Additionally, I have always connected more with female characters in tv shows and video games, especially tomboyish ones (in recent years).\n\nI'm not sure how I want to look physically and it stresses me out. I don't know what genitals I want. I want either small boobs or a flat chest (I'm not sure on this either). I'm attempting to lose weight so that I have a more androgynous figure. I'm really not sure about taking hormones because although some aspects appeal to me, like more muscle mass, I'm quite apprehensive about body and facial hair growth - I don't think it's something that I want.\n\nA whole other can of worms is that I have had, and still have, issues with internalized misogyny. I've never had a decent female role model and all the happy/successful people around me have always been male. For reasons of jealousy, I kind of wish I had been born male - I'm aware that this might be a 'grass is greener' situation, but I feel like it would've saved me so much trouble growing up. Women have given me hell throughout my life, whether that be classmates or family. But although I get quite jealous of guys and kind of wish that I could've been born a guy, I don't think I want to be seen as one. So, a big question here is whether these feelings are caused by internalized misogyny, or gender, or both. It's also worth mentioning that sexual topics in my house were not talked about. My mum always made me feel very embarrassed of my body (unintentionally). I would go to my friends' houses where their mothers would openly talk to them about things like bras and periods and it was so foreign to me.\n\nAnother note: I am not a maternal person. I don't like kids, and the idea of becoming pregnant is repulsive to me. I feel like my first and secondary sexual characteristics are a constant reminder of my fertility, and I really don't like it.\n\nThis whole thing is incredibly stressful and I feel like I'm isolating myself because of it. I know that I'm overthinking it, but I just don't know what to do. I don't know what I want to look like. I don't know how I want to be seen.\n\nFortunately, I'm seeing a gender therapist for an assessment in three weeks, which I hope will be hopeful (by the way, are gender therapists typically aware of non-binary genders?).\n\nThanks for reading this wall of text and I would really appreciate your perspective/opinion on what you think is going on.\n\nEDIT: Something that I thought I should mention. I actually miss dressing feminine. I used to love wearing makeup. I remember how pretty I would feel wearing dresses. I loved feeling pretty. But there's just embarrassment and fear in it now.

They also feel like identifying as trans would be appropriation.\n\nIf you identify with a neurogender, you shouldn't dismiss your gender feels. Your identity is just as valid as an NT's. Gender is something you feel, and what you feel is perfectly valid. You're allowed to change your life based on how you feel. You're allowed to identify as trans.\n\nWhether you identify as trans or not, if you do decide to transition, please don't feel pressured into doing things you don't want to do.

In this case though sex is male/female and gender or gender identity is masculine/feminine. \n\nDiscussions of non-binary genders, genderfluid for example, seem to describe a gender identity. That is, one who feels more or less connected to their gender/sex (male/female) at different times. This is similar to how saying that a person is masculine is not identifying whether their gender or sex is male or female, it's simply describing some aspect of how you perceive them. I'm wondering in what way the term \"genderfluid\" and other non-binary terms are actually genders, and not merely an aspect of how one is perceived in relation to gender (i.e, gender identities).\n\nThe only way that this makes sense is if the term gender is equivalent to and synonymous with gender identity and the two are distinctly different from sex. If such is the case then I think this is a point of great confusion for many people. Saying that there are more than two genders is very difficult to understand without a clear definition of what gender is compared to biological sex and then also what gender identity is in relation to just gender.\n\nIn the case that gender is the same as gender identity and both are distinctly different from biological sex, then we must stop using the terms male and female as categories of gender, because they aren't. The word male is a noun that refers to a member of a particular species that possesses one X and one Y chromosome. This is completely unrelated to any form of identity at all. In fact the phrase \"I identify as male\" really makes no sense. What does it mean to identify with your DNA? In contrast, the phrase \"I identify as masculine\" does make sense because the word masculine is an adjective that corresponds to the typical traits of human males. By this logic, the slew of non-binary genders, are indeed forms of gender identity, distinctly different from biological sex, and the fact still stands that there are two sexes. \n\n**Yes, there are anomalies, where chromosomes are not exactly XY or XX, but there are also people born with no legs, yet we still claim that humans have two legs.  \n\nAnyway, I'm curious on your thoughts on the matter, open to any and all opinions.

Being talked over.  Mansplaining.  Being condescended to.  Negative assumptions of my competence and intelligence.  Body image issues.  Pressure to diet and to be hyper-aware and hypercritical of my own body.  The weight of gendered expectations of my behaviour and demeanour.  Assumptions about my reproductive plans.  Being socialised that particular way.\n\n\nNothing good.  But *there is a connection*.  Because I am AFAB and was raised on the assumption of womanhood, I have had all of these experiences and more.  They have all been a part of my life.\n\n\nI never feel connection or like I identify with the positive things women say about their experiences of womanhood or femininity.  My perspective as an Enby person has always been a case of accepting that those experiences were true *for them* while feeling and sounding utterly alien and unimaginable to me.  Even before I knew I was enby.  Even before I knew enby was an option.\n\n\nAll of the experiences and perspectives I\u2019ve found I share with women are the ones that exist because of gendered stereotyping and misogyny.\n\n\nWhich leaves me in a weird position this Women\u2019s Day.  Because people I know are posting Maya Angelou poems about phenomenal womanhood and praising each other and celebrating their identities as women.  And I\u2019m so happy for them and so pleased that they\u2019re getting to celebrate this and feeling this connection with each other.  And it's lovely to see and I want to participate to help raise these women up and celebrate the historical women who fought for equality and who pioneered advancements in art and science and medicine.  But it\u2019s only making me more aware of how much of an outsider I\u2019ve always felt in women\u2019s circles.\n\nI mean, I feel that way in men\u2019s cirlces, too, albeit in different ways.  But I was never *expected* to fit in there.\n\nBut IRL all this week women I know have been offering to send me the poems they\u2019ve read that connected to their womanhood and recommending books to me and wanting to share womanhood with me, because IRL I\u2019m not out about my identity.  And I don\u2019t want to ruin it for any of them.  So I\u2019m just sort of\u2026 quietly\u2026 pushing myself a little deeper into the closet so I can nod and pretend I feel it too.\n\nI guess I'd probably have an easier time celebrating this day as *a non-woman who wants to celebrate women* if I didn't feel like my participation was assumed to be based on membership to the club?

The thought of people looking at me and being confused about my gender makes me really happy.\nI don't think I have physical dysphoria either, I have some body image issues because I have an eating disorder. But I believe that's a separate entity. \n\n\nI'm into body modification, and plan to become heavily modded in the future, primarily things that make me look more alien (tongue splits, magbe a bellybutton removal etc.). But for some reason I have been thinking about gender on and off for the past few years.\n\n\nI talked to my boyfriend, who told me he assumes I lean towards being NB. Aparently I talk more about wanting to be genderless alien more than I thought. \n\n\nI don't feel comfortable identifying as non bianry though? I don't have uncomfort with my body, I don't mind I'm physically female, I don't have issues with my breasts (they are quite small though) and I wish my hips were less wide, but I'm not like... very upset about it or anything.\n\n\nI'm sorry, I'm not even sure what I'm trying to get at here.

Maybe it is, and I'm moving in that direction, but there are enough things that I'm not dysphoric about or that I like about my body that I just don't know if I'm ready. \n\nBut I feel like I don't fit in anywhere. I miss feeling like a part of the lesbian/bisexual woman community sometimes, because I identified strongly with it before I realized I was non-binary, but I don't identify as female and don't feel comfortable implying that I do. I'm bisexual, but I feel like men will never find me attractive as anything but a woman, and dating men makes me feel more dysphoric because I feel like even if they're bisexual/pansexual, I won't be attractive to them in the way I want to be attractive. But I also don't feel like I fit into a lot of masculine communities, and I worry that if I do transition to a point where I pass as male, I'll feel out of place. Even among trans men, I feel out of place sometimes because I don't pass. \n\nIf I'm honest with myself, I probably have some internalized transphobia that's making me be harder on myself about not passing. But to some degree this is also just my dysphoria being weird and vague.\n\nMaybe I'm too focused on the idea of labels or being a member of a specific community, but that's always how I've felt. I like feeling a sense of belonging and community. I hate feeling like I don't belong anywhere, and because of that, when my dysphoria fluctuates, I'm prone to trying to convince myself that I can identify as a cis woman or a binary trans man even though I know that eventually, the pendulum will swing again.\n\nI've been questioning things and identifying as non-binary for about a decade, now. I'm not new to this, and at this point I don't want to hold out for my feelings to change. But it's still frustrating.

I'm just a person who has been doing a lot of reading (from sources as diverse as AVEN and The Federalist, which has been interesting) and questioning lately.  Yesterday, things started to make a little more sense and I wanted to share that experience, since I've been relying on subreddits like /r/NonBinary to help me figure out what I'm even doing in terms of gender.\n\nSo many of the resources I read talked about gender as a sense of self, which generally also had some relationship to masculinity/femininity/manness/womanness.  Up until I tried to think about my gender specifically as my sense of myself, I was extraordinarily confused and frustrated (instead of just ordinarily confused and frustrated, which is how this gender adventure has often made me feel) because I felt like I probably had a gender but I didn't have any idea how to figure out what it was without relying on gender roles or expression.  When I finally considered who I saw myself as, I was struck by the number of times in recent memory I've accidentally thought I was a guy (for example, not even realizing that I was one of the girls in a class group until I thought to myself that it was half girls, half guys and then remembered that I counted as a girl).  Although everything is still kind of weird, it made a certain amount of sense to consider myself masculine of center.  When I wrote down some gender terms that seemed to roughly correspond to my feelings, it felt surprisingly good to write \"transmasculine\".  Maybe that isn't the best word for me, but I like it a lot.  It was nice to finally grab onto something that gave me some sense of rightness, because my gender questioning journey hasn't given me a lot of \"aha!\" sort of moments.\n\nI'd love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions you have about me.

I felt different from everyone else and I had no idea why.\n\nThen I heard about transgender people. I wondered if I was FTM. I thought about it a lot. At the time I didn't feel like a girl, but I didn't feel like a boy either. So, I continued identifying as female. Mostly because my family hates transgender people, and I think deep down I wished this was just a phase. I was afraid, so I continued to deny my feelings.\n\nThen I heard about a different gender identity. \"Agender\". It was the first nonbinary identity I heard of. It was exciting, realizing I could be whoever I wanted to. I didn't have to decide if I was a \"boy\" or a \"girl\". So I clung to it. My strategy for awhile was \"just identify as agender, try not to think about it that much.\" I didn't know who I was, so I tried not to think about it. I didn't want to think about it. So I tried to slap a label on myself that didn't fit quite right, but I decided it was close enough.\n\nThen I thought about what name I wanted to go by. I tried using some gender neutral names for myself, but none of them felt right. But then I tried going by a masculine name. I don't know why, but it just felt perfect.

Once we were face-to-face I told him that my gender identity had been changing over the last several years, and that I am genderqueer and my pronouns were they/them. He said something to the effect of \"That's great, is there anything you need from me?\" I told him that all I needed was for him to use my proper pronouns and back me up if necessary.  I told him that I had prepared a short email to send out to the rest of the staff, and asked him if he wanted me to share it with him first.

It actually took me a while to come to terms to the fact, that thanks but no thanks, I had no desire to turn into Mr.Right. First it was \"I'm not FTM enough, hence a coward\", now it's more \"it would have been easier if I was actually was FTM\" (without disrespect to the challenges our FTM brothers face). \nCurrently I socially manage my gender identification by using both female and male pronouns, a gender neutral first name, male clothing and mannerism. My rationale is simple: if I'm striving for ambiguity, undecidability, neutrality, and I was AFAB, I need to \"counterbalance\" such assignment by \"adding\" some masculinity. I'm now looking into T therapy in order to further reach such balance as well as some specific effects that I hope would mitigate body dysphoria (i.e.: voice lowering, fat redistribution).\nThe practical problem I face is that I live in a EU country where transgender standards of care are quite behind, and doctors won't prescribe T to a person who does not come forward with the conventional \"wrong body\" narrative seeking a full-dose treatment with the goal of \"perfect passing\".

I've been questioning my gender for a while now. It started after my best friend came out as genderfluid, and this made me look more critically at my own gender and I've been kinda confused... \n\nSo, I've always been masculine (I'm afab). Even since I was little I always preferred \"boy's\" clothes and interests associated with boys and masculinity. I vaguely remember thinking that I wished I was a boy back then too (although I no longer feel that way now that I know NB genders are a thing) though I think that was because I didn't like the things usually associated with girls, or act \"like a girl\". \nI had very long hair until two years ago and I always hated it so after I cut it was much happier and more confident in my appearance because I looked more like how I envisioned myself. \n\nDuring puberty I hated having boobs. I tried to ignore it but I could only do that so long. When my mum took me bra shopping for the first time I just started crying afterwards. Like, proper sobbing.

I'm planning on getting a binder at some point. My voice is quite deep for someone who's afab (If anyone has played Batman: Arkham Asylum, I can reach Batman's pitch fairly easily) which I really like. I used to dislike having a deeper voice than other girls but I've grown to really enjoy it because I feel like it suits me more. I still find myself wishing I had a more masculine figure however. \n\nThere's days when I identify a lot with being a woman and days when I feel weird about the term being used to refer to me. I don't feel like a man, just really masculine or somewhere in between when I'm not feeling so much like a woman on those days. I'm cool with most pronouns being used and when people mistake me for a boy I'm not *too* bothered by it, and if I confuse them about my gender then that's perfect. I really like looking androgynous most days. Sometimes not, but most days I do. Sometimes when I've had to count how many girls are, say, going to a friends house, I'd be like \"oh yeah, I'm a girl\".

I also noticed that my voice got deeper.\n\nI mentioned this to one of the guys afterward and he said he'd noticed my voice get deeper too.\n\nIt just made my gender identity seem more real to me.

My ignorance protected me. Non-binary was barely known or acknowledged by the psych world at that time, and treatment (even HRT) was denied to any trans person who wasn't binary AND planned to have only hetero relationships once transitioned.

Secondly, I wanted to make a post regarding my own gender and journey so far in a bid to offer a bit of personal advice to anyone in a similar situation as me. I think as we are such a unique community, it is really important we be transparent with one another as speaking from personal experience, I think we truly need as much help to dispel our own fears, misrepresentations and misinformations as possible.\n\nSo, to start at the beginning, I am transgender and am currently transitioning from what I believe to be a non-binary male form to more of a non-binary female form and what does this mean exactly? Well, the way I see it, I have never felt like a man. My sex is male, I have all the bits and anatomy of a masculine, buff clich\u00e9 but I have never felt comfortable thinking of myself as, referring to myself as or even just 'being' a male.\n\nAnd strangely enough, when I start to think and dare to believe myself as being more of a female, suddenly some things become a little more comfortable. Emotionally, physically, sexually, all these areas that I now see changing are somehow congruent with how I have always felt inside. But not everything it seems, is so black and white. Because even though my breasts are starting to develop, my hips are widening and my body is going through the puberty I felt I never had, there is still much of me which feels confident in my original biology. I feel natural in my unnatural, a complex combination of masculine and feminine traits portrayed imperfectly through my being.\n\nThere are days when I wake up feeling masculine and sometimes even mere moments where this aspect blends through my personality. It could be a song, a smell, a memory or a feeling which has me react in a certain way which feels more manly than anything else. It could be the people I am with, the time and place or even for no reason at all, that all of a sudden I project and experience a masculine version of myself.\n\nThen the same goes for the feminine. A touch, a whimsy, an embrace or a taste which has me feeling so comfortable in my soft, feminine skin and I react outwardly and inwardly as any other mother, sister or daughter would.\n\nAnd then I am reminded of how I am supposed to choose. One or the other, Adam or Eve. They don't make bathrooms for people like me, we don't exist except in futuristic dystopian novels about robots and bio-mechanics. So I feel confused and undone, not knowing where my man should stop and my woman should begin. For if I have to choose I must only be half of myself and doom the unselected version to be only my shadow. I cannot do this. It is not a choice, not one I am willing to make for myself. Because no matter how much 'easier' it might make my life externally, internally there is death of the being, of the self and then I would lose what it would mean to be human. So don't you dare, you beautiful person.\n\nDon't ever feel as though you have to choose. Your life is yours, your feelings your own, we ask ourselves who we are, but very rarely do we ask ourselves who we are not. So, TLDR: here is my advice, to everyone our there non-binary, binary or questioning.\n\nDare to live. Be who you are and learn to reject who you are not. Nobody can tell you how you feel and it is up to you to discover where you are most yourself!\n\nI would love to share more of my experience and discuss what it means to be ourselves with anyone who wants to reply to this post.

I am unsure), and my boyfriend at the time who, after spending months telling me that people who ID as genderqueer and nonbinary were just doing so to be unique and special snowflakes, started referring to himself as these things (which, was incredibly ironic). I think he even told a woman that he was \"a cis nonbinary male\" or something, which seems contradictory? Anyway, I told him that I was having a bit of a crisis, and in my mind, whatever constitutes \"womanhood,\" I felt like I was on the lower end of that scale, but definitely knowing that I was *not* a man. I figured someone who is now calling himself nonbinary would surely be understanding and compassionate about what I was experiencing?\n\nI was wrong. He laughed at me, thought I was being cute/adorable. I never brought it up again.\n\nSide note: He ended up being exposed on Facebook for being abusive and predatory. This was actually not the first time that he had been accused of this, but this was the only time where it stuck. I think the post is still up there. Has over a thousand comments and hundreds of shares. It turned out that he, like many other men it seems, use certain labels to gain women's trust, enter their spaces and start harassing them. Among other things, he claimed that he was autistic and couldn't read \"social cues\" (though honestly when someone tells you that your persistent calling and texting is making them uncomfortable and that you should stop, that's not a cue. That's pretty blatant), \"intersexed\" (allegedly had a genetic test done and claimed he had like 10% female chromosomes), queer (despite being hetero), panromatic, etc. etc. He was extremely narcissistic.\n\nAnyway, fast forward a few months, and I come across this guy on Facebook. We talk for a little bit and then our interactions fizzled out a bit. We start talking again and I notice his profile says that he's nonbinary. So I ask him if I can ask him a somewhat personal question. He says yes. I ask if he's an enby (I didn't know too much about it at the time, but figured that if he at least knew what that meant, then perhaps he's not bullshitting). He says \"Yessum.\" So then we spend about a whole hour talking about this. The crux of my position was (and this will sound extremely silly) but I often feel like there are these \"women meetings\" that women seem to go to, maybe it's very week or every month or whenever the Moon is full or whatever. And they go to these meetings to swap tips or give lectures on how to be a woman. And either someone has deliberately given me the wrong address or I keep missing out on these meetings.\n\nHe basically feels the same way. I did mention to him that I am a bit weary of \"men\" who describe themselves as enby as a foil to being predatory or pulling the whole \"I'm not a man!\" when they are accused of sexism/misogyny. But he told me that my experiences are my experiences.\n\nFast forward another month and I come out to him as an enby. I think I feel somewhat more comfortable describing myself as that? He tells me he's proud of me and I can't stop smiling. it just feels super nice to be understood.\n\nSorry for rambling and my scattered thoughts. Perhaps my comments will provide more clarity? I also had some thoughts on what it means to be a nonbinary femme ", "date": "2017-04-17 18:46:00", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/65xhcz/not_sure_where_im_going_with_this_but_here_goes/", "author": "MxZaari"}, {"title": "Should I come out now or wait?", "text": "Hello you lovely people!

I've been trying to figure out my identity for as long as I can remember.\n\nSorry, this is gonna be disorganized and all over the place. (Also, it might get a tiny bit sexually descriptive at points, though I'll try to keep it as tame as possible.)\n\nI can't remember exactly when my gender dysphoria started, but it definitely wasn't any later than early adolescence.. I actually have a very bad long term memory for childhood memories in general though.\n\nBut yes, I've struggled with varying levels of gender dysphoria during my life.\n\nI grew up as the younger of two brothers in a semi-dysfunctional lower-middle-class family. Not great, not absolutely terrible, maybe average. I've always been very weird, borderline autistic-like, antisocial, etc. I wouldn't say I'm super close to either of my parents, but I probably bonded a little more with my mom than my dad. They divorced when I was 13. My brother and I continued to live with our dad.\n\nThere were times growing up where one thing would lead to another and I'd get hit by my older brother, or by my father. I was never savagely beaten to a bloody pulp or anything, but it was enough to engender a lot of rage in me, feelings of angry powerlessness.  I feel like it may have been a contributing factor to a bit of a negative outlook I developed of masculinity.\n\nI think I sort of ended up constructing in my mind something along the lines of: Male = large = powerful = dominating = stupid = brutish, solves problems through force rather than intellect. I kinda rationally know it's a bit garbage, but.. it's kinda a feeling that formed.\nIn my adult years I do regularly rebel against these stereotypes wherever I find them, perhaps due to whatever small part of me that feels some connection to my biological maleness, or because I don't want these things assumed about me because of the body I have.\nI don't know, it's like I rationally understand, or have been trying to convince/teach myself, that there isn't anything gross or barbaric about maleness, that I just need an attitude readjustment, but the feeling of \"yuck\" towards maleness remains.\n\nAlso, my mom was an evening alcoholic. And that may have caused me to lose some respect for femininity as well, perhaps. I probably have just a tiny bit of internalized misogyny.. I can admit.. at least under a throwaway account.. Ideas like: Woman = childlike = immature = emotional = stupid.\n\nNote that both genders have \"stupid\" in common, in my little messed up brain. I've been a bit of a misanthrope at times in my life. I'm trying to become a more positive person though. I'm a work in progress.\n\nSorry I'm rambling.\n\nSo, when I was a young boy, there were a few times I sorta did \"gay stuff\" with my young male friends during sleepovers. And to this day, I consider myself \"(barely) bisexual\" and occasionally do it with men. But I am (with men) exclusively a bottom, and rarely find males visually attractive at all. To me, it really seems that my forays into homosexual behavior are a way of feeling more feminine, and that may be really all it is - that I may otherwise \"supposed to have been\" \"straight\".\n\nNone of my gay experiences were ever about me wanting to see or touch someone's penis. It has always been more like.. I want to get naked and for this other person to become aroused by me. I wanted them to fondle me. Etc. I want to feel feminine.\n\nI'm ~95% attracted to girls, but I have difficulty with them, not in general interactions but I mean in terms of trying to pick them up sexually or romantically. I find it easy to pick up gay top men, because I feel more natural in a feminine seductive role. I feel dysphoric when I have to \"chase\" girls. It makes me feel more like a \"guy\", it makes me feel unwanted, it makes me feel like I'm some worthless vermin hunting for something beautiful. When really inside, I feel like I am a beautiful thing worth chasing myself, but as I'm in a boy's body, a boy's role is expected of me. That's kinda where the gay comes in, I can get that need satisfied in a way by being chased by gay men.\n\nSwitching gears slightly here now..  Though I considered I may be MTF trans for a time around age 14 or so, I then decided \"no, I don't want to transition, I don't want to be an imperfect girl through surgery. if i could make a wish and magically be a girl, i'd do it. but failing that I'd rather try to girlify the \"boy\" that I am as much as possible without surgeries and medications, be a \"boy\" but be girly, buck the expectations, be unique, whatever.\"\n\nMy gender dysphoria would end up semi-dying down for a while while I was in a 6 year relationship with a girl who turned out to be a sociopath. We were mostly doing drugs and not having a real life during that time.\n\nCut to after that nightmare which I won't spend any time on here, I start going back to school and studying singing. My gender dysphoria starts coming back a bit because I want to be able to sing higher / more girly. While I'm studying singing, I meet this girl and fall madly in love with her, she doesn't like me the same way back. My gender dysphoria gets even stronger.\n\nSo, quick pause to say, up to shortly before this point, I don't think I was aware of non binary. I had been living several years of my life basically thinking \"I feel gender dysphoria, but I'm not quite a 'real' trans person, so I guess I have to just get over it by acting kinda girly where I can.\"\n\nNow I discover the gender non binary stuff. I'm a very skeptical person, so I was very suspicious of it at first. Still to some degree am, but it's growing on me. Yet there does somewhat remain this fear of, \"what if I decided to come out, identify as non binary, then 5-10 years later, some real scientific research comes out and it turns out we really ARE just snowflakes coming up with bullshit? Then I'd look like an idiot.\"\n\nBut.. anyway.. yeah.. umm..\n\nSo.. I'm grossed out by body hair. I'm grossed out by bathroom humor. I have never in my life felt any desire to be larger, taller, older, etc. I (irrationally) see tallness as some sort of opposite to intelligence. I am not tall myself, but when I see a tall male, I secretly in my head sometimes think something like \"Jesus, look at that huge behemoth. If I were that tall, I'd kill myself.\" I know, not healthy thoughts.\n\nI trim my body hair down to almost nothing (easier to maintain than shaving, and I have light hair). I shave my armpits. I paint my nails. I wear colorful clothing and scarves. I wear make-up. Sometimes I skip around daintily. I like games like Mario Kart and Zelda over Grand Theft Auto or Mortal Kombat. I like Taylor Swift and Sia. I thoroughly enjoy the company of girls. Though I always kinda feel like my ability to present as feminine as I want is limited. I would wear skirts and dresses if I were female, and I lament that I can't pull them off so well as a boy, and so am generally not so daring to do so. I regularly feel limited in my clothing options for events and feel envious of the girl's and all the options they have.\n\nAs I mentioned before, my vocal range brings on dysphoria. Luckily I am not a low bass or anything, more like a high baritone or low-ish tenor. But still, it is a male voice. I associate a deep voice not with more respectability as seems to be the traditional association, but rather with stupidity, cave-man-likeness, etc. Hearing a female do that exaggeratedly low pitched impersonation of a man voice is very triggering to me. (\"Is that how they see me? Some deep voiced retarded behemoth monster?\")\nI want to sing the melody, not the bassline. I want my voice to sound smooth and pure and high and light, not low edgy heavy and brassy.\n\nBut.. so.. well.. I'm non binary. I've considered the terms: agender, gender-fluid, demi-boy, demi-girl, transfeminine. I don't think I'll ever be able to pick one. I think the concept of non-binary genders in western culture is still very young and primitive, and we need a better set of classifications... I feel like there are duplicates, I feel like some of the genders that have been invented are ridiculous. Genders having to do with the phases of the moon? Come on.\n\nI feel like I am biologically male, but have a gender identity not conforming to either male nor female, although probably a tiny bit closer to female, but that many of the people talking in favor of the gender non-binary are going a little crazy with it. I feel determined to find the sane way to understand all of this. I disagree with the people who say there are only two genders, and I dislike the disrespect they give the non-binary community. But I think some of the people in the non-binary community are kinda making us an easy target with the easy-going way we've approached labeling these nonbinary genders so far.\n\nI don't want to fight with anyone. I don't want to make anyone feel disrespected. I am indeed on your side but I have some reservations due to my skepticism is all. I am a nice person. I don't bite.\n\nI just don't know what to make of all this. I wanna find a better way to be myself, but I'm afraid of being wrong. I want to be reasonable, and I don't want to be a \"trans-trender.\"\n\nI don't know what I am. I am relatively ok with \"he/him\" pronouns, and will also happily accept \"they/them\" although I won't ask for nor demand it. It does NOT bother me when someone calls me a \"boy\" - in fact, I almost kind of like it.. - but I HATE the word \"guy\". Same with \"dude\" and \"man\". I don't think I am a girl although I do think I should have been a girl.\n\nI know what body parts I have, what chromosomes I have, and I know how I feel, but I don't know how to identify myself. I have told a few close friends and family members that I have gender dysphoria and have been considering the gender non-binary thing within the past year. And I live in a pretty liberal area. But, I still have reservations about coming totally \"out\".  Although there are times when I feel like if I was totally out, I wouldn't have to secretly feel hurt by certain things people say, not meaning any harm.\n\n\nUgh.. I feel bad, like I'm just rambling a huge wall of text without asking any simple primary question. I guess just.. I needed to vent, express myself and my thoughts and worries without a filter with the aid of online anonymity... and just.. if anyone has any general advice, or ideas about what terms might best fit me? Lately I'm leaning toward \"transfeminine\".  I've thought about demigirl or demiboy, but honestly, I have no idea which one I'd pick.\n\n\nSorry if this is way too long.\n\nTL;DR version:  I am AMAB and questioning my gender identity and the entire concept of gender and non-binary genders. I have gender dysphoria about being male, and wish I had been born female, but do not wish to transition to female as things stand, and do not identify as female, and can't help but feel it's my knowledge of my own biology, at least in part, that prevents me from feeling right identifying as female. I feel more drawn to identifying as non-binary, but I feel dissatisfied with the definitions and terms and such.. And with all the confusing choices, I just really don't know how to identify.\n\n\nThanks for your patience.", "date": "2017-04-25 09:10:56", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/67ff2r/amab_transfeminine_struggling_with_gender/", "author": "Birl42"}, {"title": "Anyone have tips for maintaining femme appearance while on T?", "text": "I am bi-gender, and going on T starting in two weeks mostly to get  simple meta, which is important to me.

Also this is hella long so apologies in advance, there's a lot to get off my chest.\n\nI have C-PTSD, depression, anxiety, disordered eating, and BPD as a result of a shit upbringing. No shocker there. I've also displayed gender nonconforming behavior my whole life starting at age two -- I speculate that my NB identity is a product of both nature and nurture. Nonetheless, I am astutely aware of how much my PTSD and BPD in particular intersect with this facet of my identity. I've experienced a loooot of sexual trauma starting in childhood continuing through my teen years and adult life from multiple abusers, and I still actively experience covert incest perpetuated by my father. I've come to realize these things over time:\n\nI think a lot of my gender identity was formed as a defense mechanism. I probably would have been much more okay with femininity, or even with being AFAB, had I not grown up with sexual trauma, incest, and parents who berated me for not fulfilling my role as a daughter to their liking. So I rejected all things associated with femininity both as rebellion and as a means to protect myself from my father being inappropriate.. essentially, I wanted to neuter/desex myself, and I also internalized the idea that being a girl meant being a victim. I believed boys were strong; they didn't experience these things because they were the ones with power (obviously incorrect). Puberty was horrifying to me, naturally, and I IDed as transmasculine from ages 12 to 20. (That was influenced by a LOT of internalized misogyny and feeling like I had to pick one or the other.) I've experimented with performing traditional femininity, too, and liked some parts of it.. others were traumatic because of shit relationships, so I have a more positive relationship with my femme side now, but still very messy. \n\nAnd my BPD just makes it all muddier. I have incredibly low self-worth and a weak/guilty sense of identity, and I \"shapeshift\" a lot in many facets of it except those most integral to who I am. I've struggled my whole life trying to decide who or what I want to be and do. That's thankfully improving with therapy and building my independence, but I'm also very attuned to the fact that this plays a role in the maddening amount of gender fluidity I experience. I feel things intensely, sporadically, and fluidly, and my gender identity is unfortunately no exception. The eating disorders love to play into this too; not only do I get body dysphoria sometimes, but I also get body dysmorphia! It's insane trying to identify them and figure out how much of my body hate is societal conditioning and resultant dysmorphia vs. how much of it is disliking my body for being AFAB. Still haven't really managed to untangle all that. Doesn't help that I experience a lot of dissociation too, so feeling connected to my body? Yeah, that's a joke.\n\nSometimes it feels like I have several gender identities: One that's cis female, one that's trans male, and the androgyne in between. Most of the time I identify as nothing/in the center; other times I love my AFAB body and all that comes with it; sometimes I get enamored with the idea of how I'd look if I had a masculine presentation. The last one mostly happens when I see/look at a picture of/read and write with characters who are cute men, and I want to be like them. I want to have facial hair, a deeper voice, throw on a t-shirt without worrying about how it lays over my breasts and hips, and be perceived as masculine. This was pretty rare for a while but I've noticed that I'm feeling it more lately. When I revel in being AFAB it often coincides with enjoying traditionally feminine clothing and wanting to be seen as delicate, small, young, and desirable. I do occasionally feel genuine empowerment/strength/joy from my identity as a woman, though-- sometimes I feel guilty or ungrateful for wanting to \"abandon\" it because it feels like I'm betraying women and the hardship they face and thus my own experiences with that, which I know is a common feeling among AFAB NB folks.\n\nWhen I picture myself as androgynous it can kind of fluctuate from either left or right of center, but it usually just feels.. comfortable, I guess? When I want to be cis or transmasc it happens in short and exciting bursts, but picturing myself as how I'd ideally look as an androgyne is a slightly different flavor. I'll get euphoric at the thought of going on T and all the body changes it could provide -- nervous, too, but mostly curious and happy. I'm positive that I need to at least *try* it, if I can wrangle my counselor and doctor into giving me a referral, but I'm also scared. The thought of giving up cis passing privilege is terrifying. I place too much of my self-worth into my appearance and being perceived favorably by other people, too, so self-love and acceptance are things I'll have to work hard at to achieve a healthier relationship with myself and my queerness. I've internalized so much body shame, transphobia, and binarism, though. I'm sure everyone here knows how much of a struggle that is. I am also petrified by the thought of regretting T, even though I know that a low dose for a short amount of time won't usually have too negative an effect if you decide you don't like it; I'm afraid I'd be \"damaged goods\" then more than I already am now. Part of me hopes that as I work through all of this with my counselor I will learn to just be comfortable as a cis person, honestly, because it's so much easier. And safer. And less expensive. But rationally I know those are all the wrong reasons for me to want to be a woman.\n\nI try to remind myself that my gender identity may be partly \"symptomatic\" of my abuses and disorders, but it's still me. That doesn't take anything away from it; I'm still nonbinary and queer. I am entitled to that and I have the right to be happy in my identity and my skin. I think I know the answers, I just haven't been ready to fully accept them. Every time I make forward progress (I've come out to my immediate family, friends, and health practitioners, and I've decided to change my middle name to a masculine variant) I doubt myself even though it feels right to do. I need to follow that gut feeling and stop letting my head get in the way.\n\nThank you if you read all this. Mostly I just needed to say it with the chance that somebody else might be able to empathize. Does anybody else struggle with how their identity as an NB person intersects with mental illness and/or trauma?

I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.\n\nI also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend. Whenever I'm around other women/female friends I feel uncomfortable and like I'm missing something and don't work properly as a \"woman\". Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words \"woman\" or \"girl\" to myself. I hate having \"good girl\" said to me but I like \"good boy\". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.\n\nBut I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man. I'm afraid of men. But my closest friends in life (ie the people I've felt most comfortable around) have been androgynous or feminine leaning men.  \n\nI used to say I wouldn't mind being reborn as a boy but now I don't really feel much of either. It would be really nice if the world suddenly became genderless and everyone were somewhere in between, because those are the people I'm most comfortable around. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns but I think it'd be nice if they were just implemented for everyone. \n\nI definitely feel like I'm in my own awkward not-real-woman corner, just a person. I definitely don't want to identify as \"both man and woman\", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming \"prettier\". \n\nWhat am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently. I'm also a victim of intense lifelong child abuse which may be giving me the confusion but that means I have trouble handling the idea of people being angry at me. Thanks for your patience.

Suffice it to say, I'm afab, have more or less identified as a woman my whole life probably mostly because it never occurred to me I could be anything else, then in recent years felt more and more distant from my assigned gender. I've never felt like a guy, but I often don't feel like a woman, either. I think I fluctuate between female and, like, neutral.  So there's that. \n\nThing is, I'm fine with she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my name (it's a gendered name for sure), and about half the time I dress pretty femme. So I've never really felt a need to \"come out\" as NB or anything. I don't have dysphoria, I don't think. At the most I feel kind of apathetic towards like my body and how people gender me.\n\nI recently started a new job where I have to dress more professionally, and have entered a world of frustration with women's office wear being dumb but being too small to fit into men's clothes and uhg, so that's a whole thing. I normally prefer to dress pretty casual because it feels more neutral to me to just wear tees and jeans. I guess it's triggered like...an examination of my gender, along with some discomfort. I've been thinking about it all the time and reading on here and r/genderqueer and googling things. And I've been watching Kaitlyn Alexander's videos on YouTube (bless them), and can't decide if I have a giant crush on them or just want to be them. Ahaha. \n\nAnother thing is that I've been kind of referring to myself in my head as NB/gender fluid for maybe a week or two and honestly I really like those feels. When it occurred to me that I didn't actually need to make a big outward change this revelation around (flashback to the billion other times/ways I've \"come out\" in my life), it started feeling like this kind of cool personal thing I don't have to share. Like, for the first time I'm taking control of my gender internally rather than letting people's assumptions define me. I don't do that for anything else, why should I do it for gender?\n\nBut I don't know. I've been feeling some kind of way about my gender, sometimes happy and sometimes confused and sometimes frustrated, but don't know if it...changes anything, exactly. I talk to bae about it a lot and she told me something I somehow hadn't learned in almost two years of dating, which is that she came out a few years back as just her - not a man or a woman, just her name. She's super laid back about gender and only gets bothered when people aggressively/rudely assume she's a she. And I kind of feel the same except I also have this, like, need to address it in some way. But I also don't want to make a big deal about it. Maybe it's more of an internal thing for me. But...like...gah.\n\nI also don't want to be one of those cis people who just dislikes gender norms and conflates being a different gender with just defying expectations of their expected gender. Like, do I not want to be a woman, or am I not actually a woman? I feel more like it's the latter I'm just not sure. I don't want to take up space that isn't mine to take.\n\nGuess I was gonna rant anyway.

I had an orchiectomy 2 years ago.  I began estradiol shortly before that, and gradually increased from 1mg to my current 4mg (2mg morning and night) sublingual each day.  The goal has been to change my body to become more neutral-toward-feminine, and I've had some success with that (some breast development, erections very rare, body hair thinning and hope it thins more).  I feel good on the 4mg daily, though I'd be happier if I had more sex drive and stronger fingernails.  I've done all this through private \"civilian\" physicians.  My most recent estradiol level was 212.3 pg/ml.  I do not consider myself \"finished\" with physical transitioning, and I eventually want further bottom surgery once I lose enough weight to get it done.\n\nThe Veterans Administration has worked with my civilian doctor and provided my prescription meds.  Recently though, I moved to a new city, and the VA hospital here insists on reviewing everything with their specialists.  They now insist that I see a VA endocrinologist.  The primary care doctor there referred me \"electronically\" to one of their endocrinologists, and he returned a treatment note that was frustrating---both for misgendering and for oddball recommendations:\n\n\"Would start with baseline fasting AM total testosterone, estradiol, LH, FSH and prolactin. As patient is S/P bilateral orchiectomy, she should not require high dose oral estrogen therapy and no spironolactone. Generally, transdermal estrogen patch therapy is recommended to provide adequate circulating estrogen (30 -70 pg/ml range) while at the same time avoiding first pass hepatic\nmatabolism and theoretically lowering iatrogenic DVT risk. Will still require screening mammograms every 2 years (is a generally recommended frequency).\"\n\nSo, clearly this endocrinologist missed the notation that I'm non-binary, NOT female, just for starters.  The fact that he wants me tested for testosterone level is bizarre, given that I'm nearly two years post-orchiectomy.  I'm all for reducing the risk of DVT, as I'm overweight, etc.  HOWEVER, dropping from 212.3 pg/ml estradiol level to a 30-70 pg/ml range sounds like a TERRIBLE idea, especially if I'm still seeking further physical transition.  As I understand it, this would place me essentially at the level of a postmenopausal cisgender woman.\n\nI am getting the blood tests per their direction, and I have to see their endocrinologist soon.

I'm amab, non-binary, and 19. I'm looking for opinions and advice about how much I should tone down my presentation while taking the subway back and forth to my classes this summer. \n\nA little bit of background, I go to a very liberal art college where I feel pretty safe presenting however I want to. I also live in a pretty liberal area as well. I've been out and presenting as my queer self for a while, and i've been on HRT for eight months now. It's to the point now where unless I take steps to hide my breasts I look visibly trans. This works for me on a personal level, because I'm non-binary and my ideal presentation is a pretty inherently queer one. I've been able to present this way because I lived in the dorm at my school, and the dorm is right across the street from my classes, so I never felt particularly vulnerable. I dress pretty feminine or androgynous most of the time, often with makeup, skirts or cute socks and things, though mostly I just wear whatever I feel like at the time.\n\nWhen I needed to go out on my own to other places on errands and such I would just dress normatively. However, this summer I'm back home and I'm taking summer classes a few times a week for about a month. I have to ride the subway for a fair ways in order to get to my school. I'm really worried about being harassed or targeted for being visibly trans on public transportation. It doesn't help that I also have pretty bad anxiety, and public transport completely terrifies me on it's own even without the added stress of being trans.\n\n I've gotten used to being able to express myself openly at school. While I know that's a huge privilege, I really don't want to go back to hiding my real self. I also would have to stop painting my nails for a whole month while going to classes, and having that fear interfere with my presentation in my normal personal life sucks. Toning down my presentation doesn't erase my queerness. But because I have anxiety my presentation is often the only way I can make myself visible and express myself to other people, and it's also one of the few things that gives me confidence in social situations. Plus it just hurts every time people gender me as male. Trying to \"Pass\" in public as female would be closer to my desired presentation than my assigned gender is, but I don't know if I could, and I've never really attempted it.\n\nSo what do you people think? Should I dress completely as my assigned gender on the train, or should I just present how I want anyway, or is there a viable compromise between expression and safety. It's really hard for me to decide because a combination of my anxiety, and inexperience presenting in completely public spaces prevents me from realistically assessing the situation.\n\ntl;dr - I'm amab and present pretty feminine.

I'm glad we did, because it made clear to *both of us* that this provider is NOT comfortable with non-binary trans presentations.\n\nShe was completely professional, but when interviewing me she was subtly aggressive and quite negative about my \"reasons\" for wanting T. She was very \"concerned\" about my conflicts and wanting to retain my feminine side (I told her of course I have conflicts, I'm non-binary.) She put me on the defensive, defending my reasons and understanding of the medical process and the permanent changes, etc, way beyond just \"informed consent\" issues. \n\nShe was completely dismissive of my questions (which came from serious research) and when I asked about the possibility of a bit of estrogen to feed my female side she nearly freaked and never explained anything.  I asked also about vaginal atrophy, and she offered an estrogen ring. I explained that the research shows the cream is more effective, and she shrugged and said \"I wouldn't know\" in a still professional but almost snarky tone.\n\nWhen she turned to my husband her entire body language and attitude changed, along the lines of, \"I'm here to take care of you and what can I do for you.\" There were zero questions of why he would want HRT and didn't mention ANYTHING about informed consent issues. \n\nBut then she dismissed questions/concerns of libido and loss of penile use, especially regarding spiro and wanting progesterone to help with function, she dismissed progesterone saying \"I don't prescribe progesterone. In my experience it causes depression.\" Never mind it's a standard prescription for MtFs in the Standards of Care.\n\nWhen he mentioned he wants an orchiectomy, she immediately launched into a spiel about how he didn't need one to get rid of his testes to get rid of testosterone because \"this is how HRT works\" and went into a spiel about the mechanism. I had to prod him to explain that his want for an orchi was because his testicles very existance is his primary physical dysphoria. Once she finally let him speak she changed to \"oh, I can give you a referral for that.\" When I spoke up (I kept my mouth shut for most of it, my silence may have been a record for me) to say we were hoping for preservation of function, her response was \"there are other ways to have sex.\" Completely dismissing our desire as a couple to continue having PIV sex. \n\nWhich set me off and I went full snark on her and came very close to telling her off. She insisted that I would change my mind about preferring PIV sex (to me everything else is just foreplay) and that I had to learn new ways of enjoying sex. Oh, bullshit.

Help me sort out my thoughts?", "text": "Hey all,\n\nPosted this to r/lgbt and someone there suggested I might get better responses and insight here. Feel free to let me know if there is a more appropriate space in another subreddit for this discussion. :) tl;dr at the bottom.\n\nI've recently begun exploring my gender identity and I'm not too sure where I stand or am uber familiar with gender discourse and terminology, but here are some details about me:\n\n* I am gay/am attracted to masculinity\n* AMAB and do not feel enough discomfort with my assigned sex to the point where I'm seriously considering transitioning\n* I feel neither exclusively male nor exclusively female in gender\n* I don't fully subscribe to either of the traditional male or female gender roles\n* I mostly dress in male clothes, have a beard, and short hair\n* My natural inclination is to act in a feminine manner\n* I tend to associate more/feel more comfortable socializing with those who are neither super feminine nor super masculine\n\nI go to a dance studio and take classes that are very femme in style; e.g., femme hip hop/jazz funk, waacking, vogue, heels. Recently, I started taking a heels class where the instructor is a cisfemale and I'm feeling excluded/like the odd person out. Most of her students are also cisfemale and I am one of the few \"males\" there.\n\nI'm not sure if she does them consciously or subconsciously, but the instructor says/does things that seem to favor cisfemales and come off as microaggressions to me. For example, in one class where I was the only one who wasn't cisfemale, she praised the ladies for doing a good job, but then said \"Oh and gentleman, too.\" I'd actually feel much more comfortable and included if she had just left it at \"Great job ladies\" than her singling me out. In fact, when dance instructors separate students to perform in groups based on their gender, I often (half-jokingly) say \"I'm a lady\" because I don't quite feel like a \"man\".\n\nShe also has parts of the choreography where she has us whip our hair, but then tells the guys: \"For you men, you can do this instead.\" I do have short hair, so I guess this is somewhat understandable.\n\nI also notice that she directs her attention and individual praises toward the cisfemales. It somewhat feels like she is affirming cisfemale gender performance and doesn't quite know what to think of my femme non-cis style.\n\nI suppose what I need help with is unpacking my reactions to her actions/words. Is this just insecurity talking? Has anyone ever felt excluded in female-centric spaces where \"female\" seems to mean female in physical sexual characteristics, gender identity, and gender presentation?\n\nI'm also trying to fit my thoughts into a context of feminism and female empowerment. I understand that as an AMAB, I am unable to quite identify with the experiences that these women share together, but I don't think that should preclude me from feeling empowered in female-centric spaces. I fully embrace being femme and feeling sexy and powerful in a feminine manner in my dance classes, but I can't help but feel boxed out of these identities and boxed into being male in situations like those above.\n\nWould truly appreciate any thoughts y'all have. Thanks so much.\n\n**tl;dr I am a gay non-binary/genderqueer person who presents as mostly male on the outside but is really into feeling/being femme. I feel excluded in a mostly all cisfemale dance class with a cisfemale instructor.

What are yours?", "text": "I've been thinking a lot about cultural gender associations. I see transfeminine types wanting long hair and smooth skin, and transmasculine types wanting hairy bodies and beards and short hair. And maybe it's just the way I grew up, or the way I look at life, and I'm perplexed.\n\nMaybe it's just the micro-culture I grew up in (San Francisco Bay Area), but I've never seen these as *gendered* associations.\n\nI see hairy bodies not as a male trait, but as a hippy thing. Granola moms. Back to nature types. People I associate with either not wearing a bra or using natural organic deodorant (and never antiperspirant). And Birkenstocks. My mom is the hairiest person I know (she formed my idea of hairy as a hippy trait), except for my younger son, whom I think is part gorilla.\n\n When I look at pictures of hot guys in magazines, stuff like that, they're either clean shaven or, often, straight up waxed. They're never hairy. Do you see body hair on The Rock? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Any shirtless guy on a romance novel? Hairy men tend to be associated culturally with low intelligence and \"cave man\" (regressive) attitudes, or at least that's how I interpret the cultural message I see. So why is hairy a sought-out masculine trait among transmasculine folk?\n\nLong hair is similar. I don't see long hair as a masculine or feminine trait. I see the style in which it is worn or cut as masculine or feminine. Thor (Chris Hemsworth), anyone? Maui (from Moana)? Any Viking warrior type? How about Jamie on Outlander? Where's the femininity? And again, look at romance novels. The guys' hair is often as long and flowing as the women on the cover.\n\nSimilarly, short hair. I often see it as an \"older woman's cut\" or a young woman's edgy cut if they have the bone structure to pull it off. It can be the sexiest feminine thing on the right woman. \n\nMoving on to skirts. Kilts. Sexiest, manliest thing on Earth. What is the difference between a kilt and a skirt? Not much, except for a bit of styling. All they did was give it a different name and suddenly no one has a problem accepting it as a masculine fashion. \n\nSo, that's my thoughts on cultural gender associations.", "date": "2017-06-13 21:17:30", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6h2y15/unusual_cultural_gender_associations_what_are/", "author": "CailanJade"}, {"title": "One of us", "text": "", "date": "2017-06-13 21:43:57", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6h341s/one_of_us/", "author": "give_me_a_break_"}, {"title": "Why I'm hesitant to come out to my new friend.", "text": "Hey everybody!

I told her I have gender dysphoria. I've been stuck in this toxic relationship for a year and a half, and I am considering leaving her.\n\nShe's hurt me countless times. In the past, she has:\n\n-lied to me multiple times, getting me in uncomfortable situations.\n\n-blackmailed me into doing things for her that I didn't want to do. \n\n-cut off all communication with me after asking for a huge favor, and only talking to me when she needed another favor done.\n\n-isolated me from all my friends so I would only have her.\n\n-made herself look like a victim and almost having a huge dude break my neck.\n\n-made false claims that I was stalking her, and threatened to put a restraining order on me.\n\n-called me her puppy.\n\n-left me stranded with no ride home.\n\nI did everything for this girl, and when I asked for something in return, she abandoned me. But I loved her. I couldn't leave her. I'm not sure if I can even leave her now. I still love her. She's my best friend.\n\nI've made a new friend a few weeks ago. They're genderfluid.

I don't know why. Although my gender dysphoria is mostly gone, and I identify as a demiboy, there's still feminine things I want to do, such as try on girl clothes. My \"best friend\" promised we would try on girl clothes together, when she had changed her mind about my gender dysphoria and said she'd help me. Of course, this was a lie, and she only said this to shut me up. \n\nI realized not too long ago that I don't want to be a girl. I just didn't want to be a boy. Not completely, at least. That's why I identify as demiboy. Partially male, and partially genderless.\n\nI want to tell my new friend that I'm a demiboy. I know they'll accept me, but I'm still scared.

I'm a 25 year old AFAB person and I've dealt with gender dysphoria since I was a kid, and it has been particularly bad since I hit puberty at ten. It's so severe sometimes that I dissociate or have panic attacks. I even identified as a binary trans male on and off, mostly on, through 12 to 21, with phantom penis and everything. Working through a lot of internalized misogyny and having a few toxic relationships with dudes has landed me more in the nonbinary range. Some of that's because I experience gender pretty fluidly and most of the time I no longer identify strongly with either end of the binary, and some of it is probably because I've developed a fear of men - I'm working through that as best I can, but being seen as one is quite likely if I stay on T for the long haul. Sometimes I feel positively about it, other times negatively. I'm afraid of being seen as predatory, dirty, broken, ugly, and unlovable (which, as someone who presents as a butch lesbian currently, would be nothing new). I'm afraid of social rejection from both heternormative society and the LGBTQIA+ community. I'm afraid of facing violence for being trans, I'm afraid of losing housing and job opportunities for being trans, and I'm afraid of the cost of transition, because I'm a broke ass motherfucker and I'm pretty sure Medicaid wouldn't cover this.\n\nI do relate a lot to womanhood at least in the sense that I was socialized into it, and it's colored pretty much all of my lived experiences so far. Sometimes I don't even mind my body as it is. I still pick apart what I don't like and wonder to what extent I'll be able to change it with exercise (although it's worth noting that no amount of restrictive eating and exercise have alleviated my dysphoria in the past), but I don't mind being read as small, soft, and feminine. I would still be seen that way on T too, I'm sure, but I'm afraid to lose that view of myself. I'm afraid of seeming predatory if I go into spaces and communities meant for women. I'm afraid I won't be able to talk about my alignment with womanhood anymore. I'm even a little afraid of no longer identifying with it. I feel like I've finally reclaimed my relationship to womanhood and femininity after having a very difficult relationship with it, so the thought of losing that makes me sad, even though rationally I know there's more than one way to practice those things. However, I also want to re-address my relationship with masculinity, because I practiced it poorly in the past and it's been dealt a lot of damage too, and I feel like T would give me a good avenue to do so.\n\nThis is all so confusing and frustrating and I find myself wishing I could just \"pick one.\" I've identified as everything under the sun.. trans, butch, nonbinary, whatever. I don't really know the right words for me anymore - hell, maybe it's a little of all - I just know I have this dysphoria and fluidity, I have always struggled with them, and they're all-consuming lately. And that I'm tired. I'm tired of giving myself whiplash, constantly trying to talk myself out of it. I get so close to begging my therapist for a letter to start T, walk myself off that ledge, and then repeat on a weekly basis. It's kind of messing with my ability to function.\n\nSometimes I think I should stick with the cis-presenting butch thing  a while longer and just try to alter my body through working out, or that I should just try to practice radical body acceptance more. Other times I think I should just bite the bullet and try low-dose T because it seems like this obsession will never wane if I don't.

My father is homophobic and thinks trans people are just \"so gay they think they're women.\" or bitter feminists who are too ugly to get men. My mother, while slightly more excepting in a, \"I'm happy for *those* people,\" sorta way, would probably just accuse me of wanting to be different (because there's nothing I want more than to want to tear off my face because clearly it's not mine\u2014not me) and act as if I'm placing a huge burden on her because I want her to use the correct pronouns or not call me her fucking daughter.\n\n\nI'm pretty sure my mother won't kick me out if I came out, but I can't be sure on my father, and it's a solid 4 years until I'm (hopefully) able move out for college, so if I value having shelter, I can't tell them.

The worst part is, I was raised with a more amab view on crying; that it was weak, and nothing more than a character flaw, and because I can't just stop feeling sad, I just twist it into anger. So every time they misgender me it feels like being stabbed only to feel nothing but pure rage, which really puts a strain on our relationship. The other day my mother went into a rant that revolved around the \"fact\" that I was a girl, and I don't think I've ever hated someone more than I did in that moment. (I'm still not sure if I hated her, for not letting up for what felt like an eternity, or myself, for not being able to live up to what everyone clearly thought should be a basic fact of my existence.)

I'm amab, a few weeks short of 32 years old, and I don't know what I am exactly. Can you help?\n\nThroughout my life, I've always been seen as rock-solid heterosexual male even though I'm not the least bit the macho kind of person. To quote a gay friend (who doesn't actually know about all this), I'm the kind of person who he would guess \"has a wife waiting at home\" right at first sight. Not sure why that is but the sentiment is almost universal.\n\nHowever, I've always harbored a mild interest in female fashion while I myself used to dress poorly - and now only passably decent - as a guy because I just couldn't be bothered with boring male clothes. The curiosity built and built until 2014, when I stumbled upon a community of crossdressers on Facebook. Later that same year, I ended up meeting a member of the group who was a serious expert at MtF makeup jobs.\n\n[This](https://imgur.com/quRIuu3) was the result. In the space of a minute (she wanted me to just see the final result instead of gradual change), my mind basically crashed and I went from \"ha, I'll never even look slightly feminine\" to \"now that's a version of myself that I can be proud of\".\n\nAfterwards, she told me there was a small but visible shift in my demeanor while dressed. This sent me into a tailspin of confusion. What am I? Why do I have a female side if I still liked women and only women? Is it some kind of kink?\n\nThe only clear answer I could come up for myself at the time was for that last question. Sexual gratification wasn't even on my mind that day. It was just pure *joy*. It felt right without making my male self feel wrong.\n\nThen I just had to let it out. I had a girlfriend and I didn't want her to misunderstand. Parents were right out since I didn't want them to deal with anything this complicated - at least not before I figured myself out. I ended up telling a female friend after much dillying and dallying.\n\nHer first response was that I should try a different hair color next time. A wave of relief crashed into me. At the very least, I have this tiny safe space for myself.\n\nNot long after, I ended up leaving my job for a year as a freelancer. This meant a lot of staying at home and little to no safe private time or space. The freelance year did wonders for my financial and career prospects, but my girl side was simply locked in a box, half forgotten.\n\nA year after I first told my friend, I admitted to her that I was still feeling a kind of twinge every time I see a well-dressed woman - one part generic admiration and one part jealousy that I can't go for the same look. This was about a month before my wedding.\n\nWe talked and talked. We reached an agreement. She would help \"set me free\" for a day as a girl so I have a shot at knowing for certain what I really feel. This would be the whole shebang - full-body waxing and dresses and going outside.\n\nThat was January 9, 2017. It was the single happiest day of my life. It was actually petrifying at first - letting a friend see you as... something different for the first time, stepping outside in a dress for the first time, the works - until I went into a women's restroom and *nobody batted an eye*.\n\nSince then, I've rented an apartment close to my house as a kind of vault for my girl stuff. That closet is filling up at a pretty good pace. My marriage is still in fine shape. I'm still attracted only to women.\n\nSo... that's my story. Sorry if it was overly long and rambling at times.

Someone come over plz.\"\nSocks jumped on the opportunity and headed over.  We hung out, but things were different this time.  We ended up making out and things escalated from that point, and soon we were in a relationship.\n\nSome background info on Socks: they identify as a trans woman / genderfluid.  I'm going to be using they pronouns for Socks throughout the story, although they also used she.\n\nMaybe it's because I was high pretty much every time we hung out for the first few months, but I missed (or willingly ignored) A LOT of red flags.  Socks's chaserness was insidious.  I guess it's worth mentioning here that, at the time, I was identifying as a trans man (but getting less and less binary as time wore on).  Socks had a whole folder full of art of naked trans men saved to their phone, which they showed me.  I was more than mildly skeeved out by that - I guess it's also worth mentioning that I'm demisexual and ergo really not into porn at all.  But it gets worse.  \nWhenever we were doing sexual things, they would call me names like c*ntboy, tr*nny, f*ggot...I would tell them not to, they would apologize...and do the same thing next time.  It was their attempt at ~sexily humiliating~ me, which I thought I was into, but not like that.  (I've actually realized that I'm one of the most vanilla people I know...Socks literally fetishized everything, to an absurd extent.)  Just thinking about it is making my anxiety ramp up rn.  I think that's why I need to keep writing.\n\nIn addition to using shitty slurs toward me, despite my repeated attempts to get them not to, Socks would also straight-up insult me.  Socks derogatorily called me fat all the time (I'm thick, nothing wrong with it, and if you weren't attracted to me, why are we banging anyway?) and told me that I should work out, get more muscular.  They would tell me they wished I were more manly, more aggressive.  They would try to pressure me into starting T (at this point, I had decided I didn't want to medically transition, although previously I had been considering it), telling me over and over again how hot I would be if I were manlier, etc.  If anything, all this pressure just served to further convince me that none of this was what I wanted at all.  But Socks couldn't take no for an answer, and kept trying to pressure me to be someone I wasn't.  It was creepy as shit.\n\nDown the road, we broke it off because Socks wanted to be poly and I had explicitly stated that I am not poly, yes I've given it a shot before, no I don't ever want to try it again.  They said this was stifling them.  Fine.  Be free.  We honestly were together way longer than we should have been.  I mean, besides all the shittiness, we also had very dissimilar life goals (they wanted to have kids, I didn't, etc.) and honestly didn't get along if we weren't completely obliterated (like I said, I've drastically cut down on all substances since then.)\n\nA few months later, I'm hanging out with my friend...let's call him Shoes.  Shoes and I go way back, and we have a lot of mutual friends, including Socks and this really cool trans woman who we're gonna call Sleeves. (I'm so creative, I know.)  \nShoes and I are talking late at night and somehow the conversation turns to Socks.  Shoes mentions that Socks has made some really creepy advances on Sleeves, i.e. telling her that she \"needs to let [Socks] try on her panties because [Socks] thinks that's hot\".  Socks also made advances on Sleeves right after we broke up, which Sleeves told me about because it made her uncomfortable.\n\nIn that moment, I realized...fuck, Socks is really predatory.  Socks is a chaser.  Socks has a fetish for trans people.  And from that point on, I wasn't sure if Socks is really trans or is just taking their fetish too far.  A harsh judgement?  For sure.  But it's possible, and there's no way to know for certain, I guess.\n\nAnyway, let's skip to the present day.  Recently Socks texted me, after not having talked to me for months (we did still have mutual friends and had been invited to the same parties, so we would be civil for the occasion) about \"returning\" some item they had given to me during our relationship.  I told them that, no, I would be keeping it.  They then proceeded to basically accuse me of stealing.  This was all weirdly traumatic for me and caused me to have a panic attack, and I blocked them everywhere and told them to not talk to me again.  I actually wrote a call-out post for them, which, hopefully I'll never have to share that with our mutual friends, but at least I'm prepared if they want to try and start shit again.\n\nSince then, I haven't been quite the same.  I think it was the randomness of the event, and the extremeness of the accusations, and the fact that they were reminding me of their shitty presence all at once, but I have a lot of anxiety since the text conversation.  And since I can't afford to see a therapist, I hoped writing it out would help.  So I guess that's why I'm making this post.\n\nHas anyone experienced something similar?  Want to talk through it with me?  It would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading this, and I hope you have a great day.", "date": "2017-06-22 18:55:37", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6ivmj3/when_a_chaser_from_the_past_randomly_reappears/", "author": "hocicodelkronen"}, {"title": "Just wanted to drop in to share some good news from DC!", "text": "", "date": "2017-06-22 19:31:47", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6ivv3x/just_wanted_to_drop_in_to_share_some_good_news/", "author": "cjax1694"}, {"title": "AMAB/ taking female hormones/ presenting androgynous", "text": "So I've been taking female hormones for close to about 3 1/2 months now.

One of my major hangups has been feeling like I don't \"deserve\" to have people acknowledge my gender identity and that I can't expect them to understand or see me the way I want to be seen. However, I've been fortunate to be able to be able to volunteer in some theoretically trans-friendly environments, and that's made me start to feel more comfortable.\n\nBut I had an awkward experience recently. I do some LGBTQ-related volunteer work, and we often start events and meetings by going around the room and introducing ourselves with our names and pronouns. I actually have some mixed feelings about this. When I initially started this work, I felt awkward because I wasn't really out yet and felt pressured to either out myself or lie. Now I am more out, but it feels weird when I'm often the only person in the room who uses non-binary pronouns or who doesn't pass as the gender they identify with. It really puts me on display. And while I understand that a lot of the intent of this exercise is to challenge the idea that you can assume someone's pronouns just by looking at them, I don't feel like I can take for granted that the environment is really going to be inclusive toward non-binary/gender-nonconforming people if it seldom comes up. When all the male-passing people use \"he\" and all the female-passing people use \"she,\" it's hard to actually know if people are good at remembering and respecting people's pronouns when they're not \"obvious.\"\n\nThe other day, I was doing a volunteer event with a cis person who's one of the leaders of our trans outreach projects. In the context of the event we were doing, we actually talked about trans issues and the value of not assigning a binary gender to someone based on how they look. I was vocally out as being non-binary and using they/them pronouns. And yet the person I was working with *consistently* used female pronouns for me. It was very awkward. Ironically, I'm not actually that concerned about what pronouns people use for me. But if I'm in a setting where sharing is actively encouraged, and I state that I use they/them, it's *really* noticeable if someone disregards or forgets that. And it was awkward that some of the others in our group, who were a lot less familiar with trans people, made a much bigger effort to not misgender me than the person who was supposed to be an expert. I didn't say anything, and I didn't really *want* to say anything. And I don't want to be unfair, because I know that realistically, it can be hard for some people to remember pronouns and get used to non-binary pronouns. But I also feel like if we're creating settings where there's a lot of emphasis on using the correct pronouns and not misgendering people, it looks bad if those principles aren't followed well in practice.\n\nSorry for the tl;dr. This was just a discouraging experience for me, because it made me feel like non-binary inclusion is a joke.

My fianc\u00e9(MTF, male pronouns ATM) came out to me as trans last year and since then, I've learned a lot about gender issues in order to support him through his transition and understand more about how he feels. However, his emotional perception of gender is a very binary view: male, or female (part of this is his fear of hormones changing him enough he doesn't look like his natal gender, but not enough to look his actual gender). As a result of learning some stuff from him, I feel I have as much of an understanding of that aspect of being transgender as is possible, given that I am cisgender. However, I have many gaps. \n\nIn a way, viewing things from a binary perspective is more simple. If you're unhappy with your natal gender, then transition to living as the opposite gender. I can begin to guess at how this might feel. One of my friends is nb and they realised this after they began transitioning and realised that presenting as female didn't feel right either and they liked the small changes brought about by hormones in the early stage that game them a body that wasn't strictly male nor female. This sentiment is sort of echoed by the word \"nonbinary\". It isn't defined by what it is, but by what it isn't: neither male nor female. It's like the concept of cold, cold doesn't exist, only a lack of heat. \n\nFrom speaking to my fianc\u00e9, it is clear to me that he feels not just a dislike of his male features, but also an overwhelming wanting of female features. He has been happier since starting to see changes of HRT, not just because of relief of the removal/minimisation of male features, but also a feeling of rightness of the growing female features. \n\nI'm probably not making much sense.

I\u2019m the head of [Scottish Wedding Directory](https://scottishweddingdirectory.co.uk), a wedding magazine and site.

For example, I instinctively dislike \u2018bride\u2019 and \u2018groom\u2019 as general terms across heterosexual and GSM groups as they feel heteronormative, and yet of course even if a marriage has two brides or two grooms, the terms are in theory valid. Things do get trickier, though, not so much with trans people who may have a very clear identity, but with, for example, people who identify as non-binary.\n\nWe want to be inclusive with our language, but of course we also want it to read smoothly. We would usually refer to \u2018couples\u2019, but sometimes, such as when gathering information about our audience, we want to be a bit more specific so that we can target advertising and marketing (and of course \u2018couples\u2019 doesn\u2019t account for the polyamorous!). In that example, we might simply ask for gender, gender of partner (male, female, other, prefer not to say?) and an on-off \u2018I\u2019m one of the people getting married!\u2019 checkbox, from which we can infer some broad targeting.\n\nI don\u2019t have a specific question; I\u2019m just keen to throw out to the community and see where the discussion leads us!

Sorry for the rant, it might be a bit too long and messy but I really need to talk about it right now.\n\nWhere do I start ?\n\nMost of the times, I feel \"female\" or, at least, I'm not bothered by my body and I can go on with my daily life without any problems. I have bought feminine clothing, have a wardrobe full of dresses and skirt and cute cleavage tops. I like to feel sexy and beautiful. I like my curves and my long hair and wear makeup.\n\nBut sometimes... It's the contrary. It happened several times on my life, periods where I would feel more male and these periods could last many months to one year, I think. During these times, I bought clothing from the boy stores, bought binders and wanted to present and be seen as male (even though I didn't say anything about it so no pronouns or short hair or anything, it was just how I felt in my brain and I was happy with every steps I took to look more masculine.)\n\nI am in one of those \"phase\" right now, it has been like this for ... 3 weeks I think ? I don't really now what started it (I never knew). \n\nI'm thinking of cutting my hair short. I'd never done that and I'm SO scared because I don't want to regret it later - as I seem to be running in and out of phases, what will I think of myself when I won't have this desir to look male again ? I'm sure I'm gonna cry about my lost long hair. But in the meantime - when I look at the mirror now, I can't see \"myself\". I don't... I don't know how to say this. It's like I'm looking at a picture on a magazine. Like \"yeah these hairs look great on that face but whatever these are not mines\". I already cut like 10cm to see if a fresh new cut would change my mind, but no. \n\nI'm also beginning to hate my chest again. I have a big cup (34C) and even with a binder on, it's not awesomly flat like I would want it. I'm also hating on my curves (54kg for 1m60) that make me look feminine even though I wear boy clothes - or I would need to wear baggy ones and I don't like that, plus they look shitty on me because I'm short. Frankly, right now, I'd have to have them gone. \n\nI'm also concerned by my height. I'm so fucking short there's no way I could pass as male - or maybe a fifteen y.o. boy, ahah. That's bugging me a lot. I tried to wear insoles lifts when I went out three days ago and the feeling was fantastic but I had to take them off because it hurt my foot. The euphoria was gone.\n\nAlso, when I was a child, I was always with boys and girls found me strange haha (not sure if that's relevant). I had a hard time during college to fit in. During high school, I felt out of place too. All the time. Felt like a zombie... After high school, I think I learned how to be \"pretty\" in a girl way and that made everything easier (felt accepted by other and there was no bullying anymore). I learned how to look and act to feel like I was like the other - not left alone.\n\nAnd about my body...\nYesterday, I was talking with my girlfriend through messages and she teased me like \"i want to touch your breasts/belly\" and I just... Started crying and I think I let out all of that stress from the last weeks. Going to try boy clothes that doesn't fit even in the XS size the same day sure didn't helped me either. \n\nMy GF herself says that she feels more masculine and wears boy clothes and such, too.\n\nWhat I'm wondering is...\n\nAm I feeling like this because I am influenced by her ? (But I had theses phases during years before, so... ?)\nDid I start crying because I didn't want her to touch my \"girl\" body or my \"fat\" body ?

I remember how pretty I was in a dress, and how pretty I could be in a dress. I know I get dysphoric wearing one, but I can't stop wondering if I still should try to be a woman. I want to look attractive. Also I feel attractive in a dress. It's just that it always feels like a show, and I'm tired of people believing in that show. I've tried on some dresses with my binder, and it really helps with the body dysphoria. It's a shame that most dresses have such an open neckline that they don't really work with binders. At one point of my life I wore womens' suits because I was too dysphoric for dresses. I could't do that any more. \n\nI've never tried on a (proper size) men's suit. The idea of having a suit is somewhat intriguing, but as I'm pre T I'm just terrified because I know I would just look like a woman in a suit, a butch lesbian, and a 12 year old chubby boy because of my soft skin, chubby cheeks and curves in the wrong places. I'm 29 and athletic feminine gay/pansexual man/non binary (?). I don't want to look like a chubby 12 year old boy or butch lesbian. The idea of wearing a suit just feels so uncomfortable. I want to be handsome.\n\nMaybe it's just because I've been trying to repress my feelings for so long that I still feel shame for wearing a suit. I feel just so stupid, because I know many of my female (?) friend also wear men's suits or part of men's suits. I also can't stop wondering if I'm not really trans. \n\nAlso the approach: \"you do you, wear what makes you comfortable\" isn't really helping, because wearing a dress makes me dysphoric because of my body and because everyone assumes I'm a feminine woman. Wearing a suit could be better regards to the body dysphoria, but it still accentuates all the details that show I don't have the body made for a men's suit, and uncomfortable because I assume I look fat and ugly.

Now, for like the last 5 years or so, the main thing that's been keeping me from living as myself full time has just been fear about being out at work, and in my professional life in general.\n\nI work in academia and have colleagues at different institutions all over the world, who have known me at different times and in different contexts. Many of them follow my twitter, and I've been quietly out on twitter for a while now with no notable consequences.

I don't know how to describe the feeling other than...meh. It's not so much feeling discomfort with being identified as a woman, but rather a lack of feeling like a woman.

I feel it in a bad way, like i'm not good enough to be a girl. \nWhen i was young i didn't entirely believe i was a girl, i felt alienated from them but saw the possibility of me being a boy as a bad thing. I think i wanted to be a girl but didn't view myself as one. It wasn't until i got my period that i fully believed i was genetically female. Also, sometimes i wonder if i was a hermaphrodite. I would understand if my parents hid this information from me as they are very conservative. As a kid i couldn't relate to other girls and in my more recent years I've seen myself as not enough of a girl, like too inadequate to be one.   \n\nI've always felt alienated from other girls/girl stereotypes. I've never fully understood makeup or fashion, and i often feel insecure about my femininity. That being said I feel insecure about my masculinity, too. That may sound weird. What I mean is I feel a need to be tougher and reject girlish traits, to obtain respect from others, but primarily men. Female gender roles disgust me and make me feel nauseated at times. I hate them. The small stuff about looking good i like, but don't understand. But the other imposed female roles of inferiority and sexualization make me very upset. I hate them so much. My father had anger issues, and often called me little girl as an insult. this, I think, may have created the pressure I put on myself to reject these roles, as I know in my mind (and i hate to say this, though I know it's just how society has molded me) I really do view women as weaker and inferior, and resent that i am viewed and treated as such.  I don't want people to think about the fact that i'm a female when i'm talking to them. I want to be treated like a man, but not be a man. If i had a penis i'd be miserable, i don't identify as a man. Really, I just don't want to be viewed and treated as a woman, just as a person. I don't want people to think about my gender when they talk to me. I often wish that gender did not exist, and feel that humanity would be so much better if gender just didn't exist. If we still had different biological sexes, but didn't acknowledge it, and just defined people as people, never distinguishing them with genders. \n\n I worry that identifying as agender or nonbinary will make it harder to get boys to like me. Im pansexual, but with a strong romantic preference for men. sorry i know this sounds so shitty.\n\nI do feel like I don't have a gender, but at the same time i think maybe i could just choose to identify as a girl. I just don't understand what I am. The more I think about it, the more i really do feel like i don't have a gender. I also remember reading something in the bible that kinda says gender isn't real, which validates it more for my kind of religious self. I see other kids my age (pretty much all biologically female) who are trans, typically to identify as boys or nonbinary. Anyways, i see these kids, and I feel like they haven't researched it at all, and that it may be the result of internalized sexism, which i regretfully experience. (We are sophomores in hs) I don't want to be like these kids. I want to just know what i am so i can carry on. The teenage years seem kinda crucial into developing into who you are, and i don't wanna squander them by not knowing who i am. \n\nI also have done this thing for a while where in my head i refer to myself as my parent\u2019s son. I am very quiet and distant around them, and i feel like they are currently disappointed that i'm so abnormal. that i'm not just a regular girl. I often feel inadequate and ashamed for not being able to just be a regular girl. \n\nSo uh, to restate some points: i feel different from girls, like im not good enough to be one of them. At the same time, i often resent being viewed as a girl, i sometimes view them as inferior and don't like being lumped in with them. Im not uncomfortable with my body. Im good with having boobs, but i like the idea of binding them down occasionally. I view the word girl as a compliment or an insult, depending on the context. If it's a hot person, it's a compliment. Like they\u2019re pretending i'm better than i actually am. If it's my parents or a teacher i really respect, it feels demeaning, even wrong and rude. \n\nI\u2019d like any advice, please tell me what you think.  I just want to know who I am, or steps I could take towards figuring it out. Gender therapy isn't an option for me, my religious conservative parents would never let me, and freak out about me even considering it. So please, any input is appreciated. also im really sorry i feel like i sound like huge sexist jerk by saying all this stuff.

I've never wanted bottom affirmation surgery because I'm perfectly happy with my genitalia and would actually prefer to keep it.

I am pansexual/panromantic and an extreme demi (only attracted to my partner, regardless of gender or gender presentation). Partner is AFAB if that matters, so am I.\n\nI'm a binary guy but fully supportive of NB folks. My partner's gender is very fluid, on the other hand, and I'm having trouble showing support. Not because I don't want to be, but because I don't know how and when I ask my partner is not sure. My attempts to be supportive usually result in arguments and frustration. I obviously have no idea how to show support and am screwing up all over the place, so I need guidance. \n\nSometimes their presentation is very femme, sometimes andro, never really \"masculine.\" They identify as male most of the time but other times say they don't care or don't really have an opinion on what they are. I've asked before if any specific gender identity matches up, so I can research that and get a better idea as my partner more or less just shrugs when I ask about it and doesn't know how to put it into words, but they don't like any of the terms like pangender/bigender/agender/etc. because they don't care for labels. I'm still holding out hope they'll find a label they do like because then I would be able to read and figure out how they feel; even after a few years they don't know how to explain. Even when I ask if they're nonbinary the response is either \"yes,\" \"probably\" or \"nah.\"\n\nFor example, I took my partner to the mall to get some new clothes as they had lost some weight and wanted a reward. They got all \"women's\" clothes. When I complimented their picks and said they were very nice, they got quiet and sort of shut down. In the car on the way home, they said they were worried I wanted them to \"stay a woman\" because I thought the clothes they picked out were nice and hadn't encouraged them to get \"men's\" clothes. I reassured them that that was not at all the case, and that I thought they looked nice in everything they wear.\n\nFast-forward to a shopping trip a couple of weeks after that. Partner said they wanted to get some tank tops. I had to go to the \"men's\" section anyway so I picked up a pack there. I showed them to my partner and asked if they were good. Their eyes narrowed and he said \"why would you want me to get men's tanks?\" I was a little bewildered since just before that they had been upset with me for NOT suggesting masc clothes, and this was my attempt to show support for their fluidity. I dropped it and got them \"women's\" tanks instead, but they were irritated about it for the rest of the day.\n\nI guess I just don't know how to show support to someone who is this fluid. What's also complicating things is that because I'm only attracted to my partner and no one else, my sexuality tends to swing towards however they're presenting. According to them I seem \"gayer\" when they're more masc-leaning and \"straighter\" when they're more femme-leaning. Which does make sense and I think that stresses them out. My sexuality is as fluid as their gender. On the other hand my gender is not fluid at all, and their sexuality isn't fluid at all either, so I think that lends to us having trouble understanding each other.\n\nAny help would be very much appreciated as I'm at a complete loss!

So I present as male and use male pronouns and feel more or less comfortable continuing to do so.\n\nAnd yet I don't see myself as a \"man.\" The phrase \"man up\" makes me shudder and I can't think of anything about masculinity I really enjoy.

I rarely wear any kind of make up besides sometimes  lipstick. hell, I use high heals more often than make up and that happens with as much frequency as a plane crash. \nHere in the thing though, I don't feel quite comfortable identifying as female, but I also don't feel comfortable identifying as gender neutral or non-binary because I feel somewhere in between those, which is ridiculous because you're supposed to define a label, not the other way around. I feel like, because I'm close to feeling female I don't deserve to use the non-binary label and I've never felt affinity towards queergender. Also, I live in Mexico and my first language is Spanish, which has no neutrality in anything, even inanimate objects have gender, so I feel lost.\nAnyone else feels like that or am I just drowning in a glass of water? Because I do like to be girly sometimes but I don't feel any diffetent as to when I feel more masculine (not male, just masculine). I don't know if I should just suck it up and keep identifying as female because it's the gender I feel closest to without being an exact fit. Like, if I applied the Kinsey scale on gender with 6 being woman and 0 man I'd bee a fixed 5.\nAny advice? Or just, you know, any experiences you could share so I don't feel so alone in this dilemma. It would be much appreciated. Thanks.

I'm getting my top surgery letter soon, and hope to get the surgery itself over winter break 2017/18. \n\nSo, my first question: I'll have until January 23 before I'm back in classes and living that student life, but I'll need to fly from Orlando to Chicago on January 10. I can pack minimally, or keep everything in a roll-on suitcase, whatever is best. How late do you think I can get the surgery and still be okay to travel? Anywhere before December 29/30 gets really tricky because I have family coming to the US from Europe and we never see them, so I need to be around\u2026but I've heard 2-3 weeks is standard before returning to a desk job, so I'm really pushing it. Winter break is the only time before summer 2018 when I can get the surgery without missing weeks of school, and I want to be fully recovered by summer because my sister is getting married. I have a very important meeting on the morning of January 11, 2018 that will last about an hour, but I'll just be sitting there. Thoughts?\n\nSecond question: My full legal name is Caroline. I've been going by Cara for 5 years, but as I feel more masculine I start to feel like Cara is too feminine. I've been playing with Chase as a nickname for Charles, since Charles is how my parents came up with Caroline (Charles is a family name). But Charles is super masculine and Chase is decently masculine, and I'm not sure if I want to go through the hassle of asking everyone to call me a different name. A few people have been calling me Chase at my request, and I really like it. My question is, which name strikes you as more gender-neutral: Cara, or Chase?\n\nI welcome your honest thoughts. Just typing up my top surgery woes is making me anxious, but I have to make it work somehow. Thanks for listening.\n\n(EDIT: I cross-posted in /r/ftm and someone asked when my winter break started, thinking I could get the surgery earlier, which isn't something I'd considered. My break could begin as early as December 18 or as late as December 21, depending on when my finals are. But my European family is coming in on December 21 and I don't want to be super out of it while they're here.

But, i didn't like it. I disliked doing my hair, wearing makeup, and even more, I DESPISED my boobs and still do. Bras are like torture devices. I always liked dresses and super girly clothes though. Anyway, I eventually stopped caring about gender roles and all that and just started being myself slowly. I quit wearing the little makeup I had and am now all natural. Then, I cut my hair super short. Now, I don't even shave at all. I'm happier being this way, but people often think I'm a tomboy or being Androgynous, which makes me question myself for answers.\n\nI don't really know where I stand. I know I'm definitely NOT male. And I'm not quite female either. Sure, I love cute things and my favorite color is pink, but everything else doesn't quite fit. If I could be a perfect version of myself, I'd have a completely flat chest, ether female or no genitals at all and wear lacy dresses everyday with boxers or shorts underneath.

I\u2019m new here, but I\u2019m still not quite sure if I belong.\n\nGrowing up, my parents encouraged me to develop my individuality from a very young age. I pursued whatever interested me, whether it conformed to traditional gender roles or not. I had a vague impression that some things were \u201cforbidden\u201d to me because I was a girl, but my gender didn\u2019t influence the way I saw myself for the most part.\n\nWhen I was seven, my parents and I moved to another country, and the culture shock, homesickness, and stress of moving made me very insecure. I began behaving and presenting very femininely in order to ward off my poor self esteem and negative body image.\u00a0\n\nMany things changed while we were gone, and once we returned home, I felt out of place once more. I wanted to be graceful and elegant, but I wore baggy, androgynous clothing in a futile attempt to conceal my insecurities. I wanted my body to develop in a feminine manner, but once it did, I was too awkward to talk to my parents about it, and they were too awkward to talk to me either. Consequently, I began to associate my female anatomy with shame, secrecy, and distress, feelings which persist years later.\u00a0\n\nI met my girlfriend (who\u2019s MtF) when we were fourteen. Before she began transitioning, I automatically took the submissive, traditionally feminine role in our relationship, but now I naturally gravitate towards a more masculine role. I realize that not all relationships require the traditional masculine-feminine dynamic, and ours certainly doesn\u2019t conform to \u201ctraditional\u201d standards. Yet, her transition prompted me to reevaluate my identity, and I\u2019m beginning to realize how many parts of myself don\u2019t exactly fit within the gender binary: partaking in ultrafeminine things like putting on makeup induce a feeling of intense wrongness that borders on dysphoria; I dress androgynously as much as I can, and I prefer to dress as male characters for Halloween/ComicCon; and although I enjoy working with little kids, the notion of my own potential maternity seems strangely foreign and wrong.\u00a0\n\nI know that I\u2019m not a trans man, and I\u2019m fairly sure that I don\u2019t quite count as a cis woman. I get a warm, fuzzy feeling whenever I think of myself as a nonbinary person. It just feels somehow *right*. Yet, I fear that I don\u2019t fulfill many of the traits associated with nonbinary identities either. I don\u2019t mind having a feminine body, and I don\u2019t expect that I will ever want to pursue a medical transition in any capacity. Female pronouns don\u2019t bother me, although I mostly use them for convenience rather than because I feel some profound connection to them. My name is quite feminine, and I don't want to change it either. Most troubling, I still have severe anxiety and self esteem problems, and I fear this might be just another coping mechanism. I genuinely can\u2019t tell if I actually belong in the nonbinary community, or I\u2019m just a confused cis person who\u2019s trying to be more \u201cspecial\u201d than they actually are.\u00a0\n\nI'll be going to university in another country soon, so I'll have the opportunity to change the way people perceive me, and I'm not sure how I want to present. I'll likely still dress androgynously, but should I actually come out to people there if I'm still not sure? I don't know. \n\nI\u2019ve told my girlfriend and one of my closest friends about my concerns, and they\u2019re both immensely supportive and understanding.I\u2019m immensely grateful to have such a wonderful support system, but frankly all this is still somewhat overwhelming. I realize that I need more time for self-reflection, but I hope that perhaps someone here can help me make sense of everything that\u2019s going through my head.\u00a0\n\nThank you so much for reading this.

I don't see myself as a transgender man, or a cis woman, so it's the closest way to label what I feel. However, ever since I've come onto this realization, I've been finding it harder and harder to tell people that I am non-binary. It's also something I don't bring up at all until someone asks me.\n\nBecause of this, I've learned to deal with being misgendered, and the dysphoria it brings. I don't get mad or upset at people for doing this given that it's my own burden to deal with. Regardless, it does hurt. And it's always a challenge for me to come out and tell them about my identity.\n\nI'm convinced that my reason for doing this to myself is because over last few years I feel like the term has become a joke to most people. I'm embarrassed that I'm like this. I wake up so many mornings and just ask myself why can't I be in one of the binaries? I tried for a time to go as trans and fell into a deep depression. And even now that I know I'm NB, I'm still convinced that no one takes me seriously. That they just see some special snowflake who's trying to make up for a lack of personality. But that's not the case at all...\n\nJust as well, I can never vent to my friends who are also NB or transgender. Those who are NB are usually very feminine (I guess I fit more with masculine but I don't ever see that myself) and are okay with the things I'm uncomfortable with. And I feel like I have no right to complain to trans people because they have to go through so much more than I do. So I've never really had a person to talk to about all of this.\n\nI hate being this confused and frustrated with myself all the time.

I tried and I don't want to do that to myself again. \n\nIs there anyone out there who feels as though they never get taken seriously for their identity?

Makeup, hair, nail polish, clothes. A couple of times I had butch phases, but they passed.\n\n(Through all of this, I've been queer, but closeted, and at times in severe denial.

First post here.. I will try to be brief and I hope someone can give me some light. \n\nFor many years I lived without thinking about my gender.

Those were the issues that pushed me to seek knowledge about myself.\n\n3 years ago I identified as crossdresser, but didn't act on it. 1 year ago a finally realized that I wanted to change my body and identified as trans, but also as nonbinary. I didn't feel like a woman, but didn't feel like a guy neither. I felt I was something in the middle and couldn't really fit into any of the boxes. In this part I started getting annoyed when people treated me like a guy, but was embarrassed of calling myself a girl.\n\nThis embarrassment passed really quickly and I proudly say that I am girl now. I feel stronger like this. I feel more free. But also because I understand that girls doesn't have to fit into a tight box. I like building muscles, I like using my deep voice, and I've always liked my body. I felt like a handsome guy in the past, and today I feel like a pretty girl, though the only real change on me so far was the beard removal. Today I am always happy for being gendered female.

I stopped because I'm non binary and had heard of other non binary people doing similar things in order to maintain androgyny. Specifically the creator of Neutrois Nonsense.

I already had a dirt stache to start with but it became coarse and I had to shave more often. I get 5 o'clock shadow now on my upper lip. I also have some coarse chin hairs. You could probably count them. Those grow back very quickly. Also I started to grow some side burns but it was very faint. And bushier eyebrows.  \n  \n&gt;Hairline started to change. \n  \n&gt;Voice dropped. I can post voice recordings later but even though my family hasn't seemed to notice (they don't know I was on T), there's a big difference.  \n  \n&gt;Face masculinization. I went from round baby-doll face to young man. This was the change that I loved the most. I passed about 75% of the time as a guy and the rest as a girl or \"other\".   \n  \n&gt;Body hair. Legs, arms, ass, stomach, chest. It's all very subtle but my legs are very visibly more hairy including darker upper thigh hair.  \n  \n&gt;Muscles! I wasn't buff but I had way more masculine arms and legs.   \n  \n&gt;The rest is everything else in the book: higher sex drive, energy, hungry, sweaty, etc.  \n   \n  \nSince then, things have changed FAST!   \nNo changes in hair yet, but my newfound muscles are all gone. I'm back to my feminine arms and legs. My face is a round squishy feminine face again. My dick is the same. I pass as female about 90% of the time now, albeit a hairy one, and the rest of the time, people hesitate to gender me. I can post photos if anyone wants. I've been too afraid to record my voice because that was nearly the number one reason I felt T was life or death. I absolutely hated how I used to sound and it would always give me away. Friends would even, well meaningly, ask if I experienced dysphoria because of it. Rude, I know. But without having recorded it recently, I don't know if it has raised up at all but I notice that my \"default\" tone is higher again. I can still go lower but it has to be a conscious effort.

Someone will only see it if they specifically browse to my \"About me\" section, but it's technically now there for all my friends to potentially see, no ambiguity (other than the sort of ambiguity that is nonbinary itself).\n\nI mentioned offhand yesterday in a comment to a stranger on social media that I don't identify as a guy but will defend them.\n\nI feel like the the trickling is speeding up exponentially.

I (AMAB) recently came out as non-binary and even more recently have started to identify as trans-feminine. As I have begun accepting this part of my identity one of the things I did was start to shake up my wardrobe. I started shopping for women's clothes this summer and have been working to create a more feminine style for myself. When I started this journey I was looking for inspiration and discovered very quickly how little there was.\n\nFrom my personal observations, it seems like most non-binary fashion and style resources out there are either by/geared toward AFAB non-binary people creating a more androgynous/masculine style, or AMAB non-binary people who are thin to average sized and often with already androgynous to feminine body types. These resources are great, but as I am definitely of the plus-sized, male-bodied variety, I became quickly frustrated because I felt like there were no resources out there for me to really draw inspiration from. With the help of some women's plus-sized style guides and some amazing friends, I was able to find styles that work for my body and make me feel great, though it took a healthy amount of trial and error.\n\nSo my question is this: would there be any interest in a blog geared toward Plus-sized, AMAB, Non-binary, Trans-feminine Style (or PANTS, as I have decided to call it)? I have considered documenting some of the outfits I have put together, talking about sizes and finding shapes and cuts that fit my body type, and my journey to realize my full self.\n\nLet me know if this is something you would want to see!", "date": "2017-08-06 18:21:46", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6rzytt/interest_in_a_blog_xpost_from_rnbfashionadvice/", "author": "epicureanbibliophile"}, {"title": "Grief and Transitioning", "text": "I wrote this on my facebook and thought I should maybe post it here too.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI have been avoiding binding not because of the heat but because of the sadness it brings.

I have to tread a path that isn't really talked about and is thick with underbrush.\n\nPutting on my binder reminds me how much I hate my body. How happier I would be if I could just go further with my transition. But my grief and attachment to my body makes me feel less. That I do not deserve to transition because I have formed an ok relationship with my body as it is. Looking in the mirror when I'm binding makes me feel like sobbing. I'm reminded of how happy I would be if I could face the fear.\n\n\nBut I AM scared. I have tried so hard to love my body. I just want to be better but I'm scared I will regret it. I am scared I'm faking it. The idea that your transition is magic is bullshit. There is a terrifying aspect to it all. To letting go of the body that you've had for your life up until now.

We have recently moved in together and we're very happy and support each other as much as possible. \n\nIn the past year my partner has changed their pronouns and I asked L if it was okay to tell my parents which they said it was fine. So I brought it up to my parents the next time I saw and told them that L now uses they/them and my parents got very defensive and tried to argue with me about my partners decision. I dropped it when they got like that and moved on with the conversation. Since then I've brought it up multiple more times and they're still being combative. \n\nMy mom is being better about and says she's trying and I believe her. My dad on the other hand is a Fox News conservative and I don't know how to talk to him about his beliefs and political leanings. I've tried before but he's so stuck in this mindset. \n\nSo today my parents called on speaker phone just to see how I was doing. My partner is out of town and  were asking when they would be back but the during the entire conversation my parents never used they. At the end of the conversation I brought it up calmly that if they would please try and stop using the old pronouns because it's a bad habit and disrespectful and they got defensive, again. My mom was saying shes trying, it's hard, yadda yadda yadda. But this time my dad raised his voice and got into how ridiculous and dumb it was that I was getting annoyed about it and saying how everyone's to sensitive. I don't know what else he said because he very rarely raises his voice and it caught me off guard that he got that offended and defensive over this. I didn't like the way he was talking about me and my partner and I know I shouldn't of but I yelled back saying \"how dare you talk about my partner like that, fuck off!\" and hung up crying in anger and what ever.\n\nSo I don't know what to do. They both texted me apologizing and I responded to both but was pretty short. I can send info to my mom and she will read and watch them but I don't know how to talk to my dad about this.

I recently received a letter regarding a session at Charing Cross GIC, I'm aware that people are invited to these before their first appointment. However I have since been called in regards to a first appointment, which will be in two weeks time.\n\nI suppose I should also give some context as to why I'm writing this post. I began my gender identity journey around September/October time last year. I essentially had been puzzling over some gender related feelings and doing my research on gender when I came to the conclusion that I was transgender (transmasculine as I'm AFAB).\n\nOver the course of my journey, I have tried to explore my identity and expression in more depth. I was fortunate enough to have two rounds of therapy which helped me explore things more. One thing my therapist mentioned is that it sounded less that I was questioning but rather being doubtful.\n\nThis resonated with me as whenever I think of my gender, it's some form of non-binary/genderqueer/gender non-conforming identity. I identify with those labels but I feel I might be bigender (female/neutrois). I'm coming to terms with my feelings but I can't help feeling like an imposter as an AFAB femme-presenting non-binary person. \n\nI feel some connection to womanhood but also to gender neutrality, at times being gendered as female feels either wrong or not wholly accurate. It's hard to describe. It's also difficult because I see the stereotypes of \"SJW non-binary\" people, I am also left wing and am heavily interested in broadening the concept of gender massively. \n\nI never know if my anxiety comes from being nonbinary in a cisnormative society where we're told there are two genders with just many variations. \n\nI think any dysphoria I experience is mostly social, sometimes maybe physical. If mental dysphoria manifests as anxiety over your identity, then I'd say this is quite high. \n\nMy main question is, will I be treated as someone who could not receive therapy at the GIC? Am I foolish to feel I could possibly be diagnosed with gender dysphoria? I have countless moments where I try to tell myself I must simply be a cisgender woman who has been taken in by the nonbinary community but don't truly belong, mostly because of my presentation.

I started wondering what my life would be like as a girl as early as 15 (I'm 21 and AMAB btw), even asked a few of my friends how they would see me (like would I be femme or tomboyish, I can kinda see myself as both) and even asked my parents what my name would have been if I had been AFAB. They didn't really have an answer for me though. \n\nI didn't really know anything about gender identity back then tho, and it's been a few years since I discovered how much I adore androgynous characters in media (especially anime because I'm a total weeb degenerate lol) and actually wanted to be one of them. But even so, I didn't even really think too deeply about that. There's definitely the feeling that I waited too long to explore all of this, and I've finally gotten to the point where I don't want to stall any longer. \n\nI don't know if I can say that I have dysphoria, but I do know that I'm unsatisfied with my body right now. I absolutely loathe my body hair (especially what's on my legs and in between my crotch) or how skinny my arms and torso are (which is why I started working out with a personal trainer). I don't want to get rid of my junk and I'm not sure if I want or need HRT or top surgery. But I suppose there's plenty of time to figure that out. \n\nAfter talking things through with some of my trans and NB friends, I think I'm fine with being androgyne but I want to get in touch with my feminine side more because I can't think of a single day of my life where I felt any affinity to masculinity. I feel like I could be a lot more feminine than I am now. I don't mind boys clothes but I also would love to wear cute girly stuff and pass as both male or female (because I don't necessarily see myself as either nowadays). I don't mind male pronouns but I think I'm going to try moving away from them because they/them fits me a lot more. Lastly, I'm no longer quick to correct people when they call me ma'am over the phone. \n\nSo I guess at the end of this I have pretty much figured out that I'm non-binary, but I wanted to ask others if this sounded like being non-binary to them. \n\nBut most importantly, what do you all think my first steps should be?

But it just didn't feel right. I was supposed to keep taking birth control, but I didn't, and didn't tell my doctor. I even asked to go on a different medication, not even voicing my concerns completely, just saying that my emotions and migraines were out of control. But now she says this other medication (metformin, which is actually a medication for diabetes, which I don't have but helps balance hormones) might give me my period, and it might help me lose weight - but now I'm thinking of asking to just go back on the birth control or do nothing because even though I need help losing weight (huge issue for me), it's not worth having my period and not having the option to skip it.\n\nAnother thing. TW: I was raped about a year ago. It really messed me up bad. I have PTSD because of it. I'm in therapy and see a psychiatrist. I was already doing that but it also caused me to be hospitalized three or four times. I've already struggled with depression, anxiety, and past abuse. Anyway, I wonder if some \"dysphoria\" I have with my breasts could actually be tied to the rape and how bruised they got, and how maybe it's just a huge trigger now. I used to be fine with that part of me. It now just makes me feel terrible when anyone is looking at my chest or sexualizing me as a woman. I never feel like a guy but I kind of want to disappear, even though at the same time I wish my boyfriend and I were having sex even though our sex life is non-existent and we're poly, and I'm scared to even try to seek out someone else.\n\nLately I've looked up binders and wondered how that would make me feel. I never want to be a guy. However, sometimes I really feel uncomfortable with my womanly features, or at least my chest and my long hair (I'm trying to get my hair cut really soon into some sort of side cut asymmetrical bob I think), and from what I've seen online/ on tinder, I'm really attracted to women/ people who have androgynous looking genders? I hope that doesn't sound offensive. I find myself being attracted but also wishing I looked like that and wanting to emulate it. I wonder if this is a new thing or if it's been there for a long time and I'm just now acknowledging it. I've always struggled with what to wear when I go out and some days I've dressed a certain way but some days I've dressed in a way that makes me \"comfortable\" and it leans more towards androgynous.\n\nI have found myself lately wanting more androgynous clothing and wanting to look that way more? I've reasoned it to not wanting excess attention from guys and it being a comfort thing but I don't know if it's necessarily a negative thing in that way. I don't know if maybe it means that I just feel more comfortable being androgynous. Sometimes I still like dressing up but a lot of the time I don't. Idk.\n\nBut at the same time, I love makeup?\n\nI think a lot of disappointment in my body is weight related. Maybe I'd be more comfortable being womanly if I wasn't overweight. But I'm not sure. Also a lot of it is related to my sexuality I feel like, and having finally come out as bisexual after hiding for so long. I feel more comfortable dressing a certain way, maybe not as feminine, because I don't have to necessarily hide who I am.\n\nDoes anyone have any insight into if any of this makes me genderqueer/ nonbinary/ genderfluid, or if there's something else going on?

AFAB enby here. I'm still pretty new at all this, so be nice please.\n\n\nI only first heard of NB people from Thomas Sander's youtube videos. His friend Joan identifies as nonbinary, and Thomas always makes sure to use their correct pronouns. It didn't click that I identified the same way until I did some pretty intense googling. If I hadn't done the research, I'd probably still be a very unhappy female.\n\n\nI'm loving all the representation that the LGBTQ community is getting now, in the media, on TV and in movies, and in books, what have you. But 9 times out of 10, it's a (cis white) gay or lesbian. I can list one trans character and that's the woman from Orange is the New Black. Otherwise, every single goddamn character is either straight, or cis, or both.\n\n\nOn a related note, I am a strong advocate for self-discovery. It's a process, not a destination. In real life, it can take people years to understand themselves, and even if they recognize their own queerness, repression and homophobes (and transphobes, and biphobes, etc) can keep people from coming out.\n\n\nThis is rarely explored in the media. Gay characters are gay. They're out and proud. Or, they're gay, but they need to come out of the closet. But my point is - they know they are gay! Or bi! Or trans! Or whatever queer identity applies! They already know and have a word for themselves and everything!\n\n\nI can't think of a single example (off the top of my head, feel free to illuminate me) of a queer character who *legitimately didn't know who they are* and then went through the process of self-discovery we all go through. We aren't born queer. Well, we are, but we don't shoot out of the womb wearing a rainbow flag around our necks as a cape. At some point in our lives, whether that's early or late, we figure out our identity. Or maybe we never do. And that's okay.\n\n\nWhat's not okay is little old me sitting here thinking, I can't be bi, I've always been straight. I can be NB, I've always been cis. And yet, I went from CisHet one year to a bisexual (possibly demi-sexual) nonbinary (possibly agender) the next. I'm still in the middle of this process. And that's okay.\n\n\nSo, why doesn't the media acknowledge this? In my lowly opinion, it makes for a much better story than the old \"I'll have a gay panic and then suddenly be overtly gay all the time\" which is growing a bit thin. Give me a young person of color who likes to wear dresses *and* suits, and finds out they're genderqueer, but takes some time to figure out if they're trans or NB or genderfluid. Give me a 40 year old widow who never gave her sexuality a second thought until she fell for her kid's preschool teacher. Give me queer people protecting and supporting one another, and helping each other learn about themselves.\n\n\nDon't give me the token gay. I don't need one minute of your gay best friend to prove you're not homophobic. I don't want to see the same cis white male have a gay panic and become that token gay best friend.\n\n\nGive me people who don't know who they are, who figure out who they are in a positive way, and maybe not end up in a box.

I am drawn to physical femininity too. If I see the face of a normal guy, I would never want to look like that, even if he is handsome. When I see very feminine looking cis men who could pass as girls I feel envious of their physical femininity. Same with certain girls. I feel envious of their face and posture.\nI have always had a strange feeling towards my penis. In my imagination it is never there. I just don't like it. I don't terribly hate it. I even masturbate. I just don't want it to be touched and I would want to cover it up in a relationship. I intensely hate facial and body hair, dislike my rather manly shoulders and my large masc feet. I wish I would have girly little feet and narrow fem shoulders. I love having a feminine voice and feel very pleased when I'm gendered female on the phone. I would rather want soft facial features than sharp facial features.\nI recognise everything trans people experience. It all clicks when I read what other trans people mentally went through.\nI feel a strong urge to feminize my body and face.\nOn days that I feel masculine I want to puke. I hate feeling like a man. On days that I feel girly I'm relaxed and comfortable.\nI have no desire to be with a man as a man. Not out of disguest or something like that, it just doesn't feel like me when I imagine my male face and body having sex with a man's body. In my sexual imagination I always imagine myself as a woman with a man.\nI feel a strong envy towards trans women, not towards trans men. I feel envious that she gets to look like she looks.\nI hate everything masculine because it doesn't feel like me. I love feminine things. Everything feminine.\nThere is a voice in my head that tells me that maybe I should just live as a feminine gay cis man. When I try to think about that it doesn't feel right because I would be with a partner who expects me to be a man and who would treat me like a man. A gay relationship doesn't appeal to me because that would mean that I still have to be a man in the relationship. There is a very girly gay guy who looks so feminine that I envy his appearence. There is one thing that I don't envy and that is his facial hair. Facial hair makes me depressed and grosses me out. He looks like a girl with short hair and I want his soft features and his tiny feminine body.\nI want to be with a partner who treats me like a girl. When I think about pushing a button and being reborn as a woman I don't think I would push that button. I would want the body of that woman but not be viewed by society as a woman. I wish I could have a female body and enjoy male privilege. My desire to have the body of a female is not driven by a sexual force. In fact, I don't relate to crossdressers at all. I'm not aroused by being a woman and I am not focussed on women clothes. It's more a feeling of a woman's body matching with how I feel inside.\nWhen I think about being a woman in society I hate being treated by men as weaker, I would hate not having a big career and I hate never being able to have the status men have. In a perfectly equal world I would push the button to become a woman in every aspect but not in this world.\nI had counseling for more than a year and didn't come home any wiser.\nFrom doing my own research I feel a strong connection to trans women living non-op and to very feminine gender non-conforming men with a feminine body, face and mind with almost no male characteristics in their appearence. The desire to have a feminine body and face is very strong and unexplainable. Picturing myself with a very male body makes me extremely depressed and angsty.\nPicturing a situation where society sees me as a cis woman feels wrong. Picturing a situation where I can live as a woman while being seen by society as a transitioning individual that is not strictly male or strictly female but more in the middle feels exactly right.\nI have this voice in my head telling me that I'm just an effeminate gay men with internalized homophobia. It doesn't ring true though. I experience intense gender dysphoria, hate being seen as male and hate looking male. It also wouldn't feel right if a man saw me as a man. I just don't want to be seen as a man by my partner.\nI wish that it was possible to find a balance between male and female. Female body, gender neutral presentation and social status.\nI don't know what my future will look like or if I will ever have a partner. I have thought about living as a gender non conforming man and while that could work on the short term it would give me more dysphoria once I will start becoming more manly and age like a man. The route of a fully transitioned post-op trans woman doesn't appeal either. I want to be a person with a feminine body who is not strictly male or female. I just don't know how I can accomplish that.\nThe route of a non-op trans woman minus her binary gender expression sounds more or less right.\nSometimes I wonder if there are other people like me on the trans spectrum. Who deal with transgender feelings, sometimes think that they are just really gay despite knowing that a complete life in their birth gender doesn't feel right either and who don't want to restrict themselves to just male or female but want to live in the middle and have a body with equal amounts of sex characteristics of both male and female.\nAm I really the only one?", "date": "2017-09-03 00:11:43", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/6xpyw7/i_have_gender_dysphoria_but_sometimes_i_wonder_if/", "author": "Transwithimpostersyn"}, {"title": "Request: photos of male-presenting people with obvious breasts (read description before downvoting!)", "text": "Hi...so, I know this is weird, but I don't want photos of people for some messed-up reason: I want them so I can know what someone like me would look like if they took T but didn't get top surgery and *didn't make an attempt to bind/hide breasts*, etc. We are often exposed to pre- and post- photos of binary transpeople, which can be helpful for us...but there seems to be less photo documentation available for \"partial\" medical transition, or whatever you want to call it.\n\n\nSeriously the only thing I can reference is like, [body paint](http://www.warpaintmag.com/2013/12/17/its-just-an-illusion-3/).

No doubt about that. But I don't know what it \"feels like\" to be male, female, or anything else. While I've pretty much always wished that I had been born a girl, I wouldn't necessarily say that I \"feel like a girl.\" It's just that I'm incredibly uncomfortable being perceived as and treated like a guy. And while I would be so much happier if I had been assigned female at birth, I'm not sure if I'd be *totally* comfortable with that assignment, either. It's like the difference between a pair of shoes that's five sizes too small versus a pair that's one size too big. One's definitely more comfortable than the other, but that doesn't make it a perfect fit. And maybe I'll \"grow into these new shoes\" after I officially come out to everyone. Or change my wardrobe. Or change my name and/or pronouns. Or start HRT. Maybe it's just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a binary trans woman. But it may also be just a matter of time before I realize that I'm a femme non-binary person. I'm honestly not sure.\n\nI also wonder if I'm hesitating to call myself a trans woman due to some form of internalized gatekeeping. The way I've explain it to some of my friends, calling myself a woman and using she/her pronouns feels a bit like calling myself a dancer; I'm definitely not \"not a dancer\" (because I do love to dance), but I certainly don't have the years of training and experience that seems to be the prerequisite for calling oneself a dancer. And I know that trans people are the gender they say they are and have every right to refer to themselves as such! But while I believe that wholeheartedly when it comes to other trans people, it's a lot harder to accept that truth for myself. (Or maybe I hesitate to call myself a trans woman because I'm not? It's all very confusing.)\n\nSo I'm looking to hear about what being non-binary means to the people on this subreddit. Maybe hearing other people's explanations can help me get a little bit closer to figuring myself out. (And if you feel so inclined to analyse what I've said about myself and provide your own opinion as to what my gender may be, please feel free to do so.

Would really like someone to talk to!", "text": "Hey everyone.\n\nI'm 20 years old, AMAB. For a few years now I've had some vague confusion relating to my gender identity. I'm pretty sure that I'm not a full-on trans girl, I don't (think) I experience dysphoria, although I know that it's possible to be one without it, and I am usually happy to present masculinely, even sometimes want to be more masculine. I don't think that's about fulfilling a societal expectation so much as just liking the idea of being big/strong/\"manly\".\n\nThat being said I also sometimes (keyword sometimes) want to be a girl, basically. Cute, small, pretty. Of course it's possible to be those things while identifying as male but I think this goes a little beyond that. Like sometimes I'll see a woman on the street and kind of envy her, or want to have her body, whatever. I have no idea where that comes from. But again, sometimes I'll see a guy and \"wish\" I looked like him. It's a bit different, not envy usually so much as really liking/wanting to emulate a style or something, but I think that's mostly because I already have a male body.\n\nThis kind of extends into sex and relationships, too. I'm bi, or at least identifying that way. Sometimes, I'm a girl in my fantasies (it may or may not be worth noting these fantasies specifically usually have a bdsm element, where I'm the sub) but in others I'm basically who I am right now (and usually am the dom when it gets kinky). Obviously there's some patriarchy reflected in the kinky stuff, but I don't think that's at the root of my desires.\n\nI seem to like being masculine when I'm involved with women and being feminine around guys. That's probably an internalization of some kind of straight cultural ideal, but it's the way it is. I dated this guy for a while, and sort of experimented with playing up my feminine side around him, (like I shaved my legs and wore women's t-shirts), and while I kind of enjoyed that, I wouldn't really want to do it around girls. I find myself most emotionally comfortable around girls as well. The only people I've ever really been in love with were women, and most of my friends are as well. Dunno whether that means anything.\n\nBasically, what do you all think? I'd appreciate advice from any perspective. I'm not cis-cis, at least I don't think, but I'm also pretty sure transitioning to female isn't what I should do. (Plus, I'm lucky enough to be a reasonably good-looking guy by conventional standards, but I don't think I'd make a very pretty girl. I like feeling attractive and don't want to stop!)\n\nIt feels pretty good to gather my thoughts and feelings and write them out, too, never done this before. Happy to talk in PMs too.\n\nTL;DR: Sometimes I wanna be a girl. Often I like being a boy. Pretty sure if I were a girl, I'd sometimes wanna be a boy. I think.

When most people recall memories, they can easily see themselves in the memory.  They see their body with their face.  I don't, and I never have.  When I think back to old memories whether they're from yesterday or 20 years ago, I do not see myself.  In place of where I should be in my memories, I see a woman.  It's always a different one.  It could be a woman I know in my waking life or it could be a cartoon character.  The only constant is that the woman is always very attractive.  Even when I play video games, namely Mass Effect, I feel so much more at ease doing a playthrough as the female character and find myself resonating with them often.  Doing a playthrough as the male character feels annoying and I don't see myself in them at all.\n\nChildren often relate to or resonate with cartoon characters, storybook characters, etc.  Usually one that is like them or one that they want to be like someday.  I've always resonated with strong female characters.  To this day, I couldn't care less about the male characters and I always see myself in the strong female characters, especially if they're disciplined and independent.\n\nBeing called a man does not feel wrong, but it feels like there's something missing.  Being called a woman feels slightly better, but there's also still just something missing.  I have no preference whatsoever for pronouns, but I go with masculine ones since that's what I've always gone by.\n\nI've been confused about this my entire life.  Even as a kid, I didn't understand what these feelings were.  I was always so confused watching Pokemon as a kid and just feeling more in tune with Misty or Officer Jenny (both strong, independent, female characters).

I find that those things are all tangled up for me and I can't really separate \"who I like\" from \"who I am\", it's the dynamic that matters most). \nI didn't really know where else to put this. I have more or less settled on the conclusion that I like both boys and girls and perhaps some transfeminine identities that fall in between. It's been a painful process and the conclusion came in a pretty \"all right, fuck it.\" way. I was just tired of trying to find a name for it, and since law school is pretty much my life partner now, what did it matter, anyway. There's in fact at least three of us in my 6-person friend group that are bi or bi-ish. And I still feel they wouldn't understand. And it makes me feel like the worst freak on the planet.\nI like boys, but I feel like being the masculine one with them. You can read most of it on the r/rolereversal subreddit. The thought of being the femme one in a relationship with a guy just makes no sense to me, either we're neutral vessels of egalitarianism or, in fact, I really really like boys with an obvious feminine side to them, too. I feel pretty inadequate and weak and girly compared to most guys, so I generally tend to avoid them and any romantic relations there, because it's all so heavily gender-role-coloured and I can't handle that. I want it either eradicated or slightly reversed.\n\nI like girls, but I have stupid, stupid standards both when it comes to myself and potential partners. Chub, hairs, farts, the whole *oh my god, we're gross sacks of flesh that have human characteristics* aspect just completely fucks me over when it comes to girls. When I think about being with another girl, that's the only situation where I want to feel femininely beautiful and sexy. But it comes with a set of super fucked up standards, and I don't meet mine, but I can't really get around them, either, so I've just given up for a while.\n\nI'm 20 soonish and still finding myself. Obtaining some constant sense of self in regards of my sexuality and gender expression is fucking impossible though. The situation is kind of schizophrenic and every time I remember that issue (I drink, lift and study to forget. Drinking has the opposite effect, so I'm slowly giving the weekend celebrations up) I think myself to a headache.\n\nBoth of these ways of being and expressing myself are exclusive to the completely inappropriate genders, the thought of having it any other way just grosses me out though. I feel as if... those dynamics are essential to me. Besides the fucked up high standards when it comes to girls, all the aspects of wanting to be masculine or feminine or yearning to be loved and appreciated in a certain way have brought me joy. But I can't really be both. So it feels as if I have to... choose or decide something. It wouldn't be that way if I could just imagine myself as I am, with both guys and girls. But I can't. I could never present, act, express myself in a butch manner with another girl. And I could never throw myself at a guy while not expecting to be appreciated for strength, courage, musculature, confidence and a somewhat boyish aura.\n\nIt's driving me fucking insane whenever it enters my mind. I try to not think about it, but when you get lonely, you start thinking about what kind of people you like anyway, and oh no, there it goes again, the same old circular, fucked up argument with self.\n\nIs there a way to present like this, live like this, or is it just inherently unnatural and evidence of some personality disorder/issues? I've never had any traumas or anything like that. it just... is there from the start. I only started thinking about girls at about 12-13 I suppose, but the fantasies of being a more masc girl with a relatively more femme guy were there from the very *beginning*. what the fuck is this and has anyone experienced that sort of feelings? \nhow do you deal with it? \ncan you just choose your presentation based on who you're with or is that universally considered manipulative, unhealthy, insecure... even if it makes you feel good, \"right\", even?

For info, I'm a queer identifying AMAB and typically wear clothing and present myself male. In terms of my masculinity, I see myself as \"just a guy\" usually. The thing that's bothering me is I don't seem to be engaged in any sense of style (band t-shirts and jeans, woo), and while I'm now at the age where I should be dressing a bit more dapper/professional/less-slobby (30's), I feel like I'm being an impostor.I enjoy being a man and don't envision myself as a woman or transitioning, I just wish I wasn't ALWAYS presenting typical male.\n\nIn addition to this, I've noticed that my self-confidence has taken a hit lately. Much harder to make the most out of the day and it really takes effort to work on personal hygiene, though I generally feel great when I clean myself up. I just don't feel like my gender expression has ever really been *mine*. \n\nI live with my partner (f) and have hinted in times of distress that I don't feel great presenting as a typical \"man\". Her way of supporting me is letting me wear her earrings every now and then, which makes me feel great. I don't envision that I'd want to change too much about myself, maybe dye my hair a wacky colour, wear more effeminate earrings and nail polish maybe? I have a decent beard that I'm rather fond of. It's all very confusing.\n\nI've been racking my brain trying to figure this out for a while. My biggest concerns are that I'm trying to enter the freelance professional world and I'm just not sure whether this is just fantasy. Could it be that the queer in me just wants to be free? I've been mostly stealth for years and I feel like I'd need to come out again. Is 30 too old to start messing with gender expression? I know it isn't but is it what I want? Ugh.

I'm a 25 year old AMAB and pretty much am 100% sure I'm not cisgender at this point; however, for the past year and after 2 counselors, I'm still questioning where on the trans spectrum I may be, and my previous interactions with trans community haven't gone well. After lurking here for about year, I figured I would run it by you fine people and any insight you could provide.\n\nBackground: \n\nLooking back now, there were signs that I was trans even when I was young: primarily being jealous of my sister's Barbies (they got me a Ken doll instead; although I did still love action figures--which are basically the same as dolls) and when we created our own Transmorgifier from Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I used it to make myself Brittany Spears. It wasn't until 5th grade that I actually became interested in women's clothes, after I noticed a girl in our class developed breasts and became fascinated by this: most of my early fantasies involved growing breasts or trading body parts, and that pretty much set the tone for most of my fantasies since. I started crossdressing and looking up trans and women's underwear online; I was caught a few times, and I would deny everything and passing it off as simple curiosity.\n\nHowever, despite all this, I liked being a boy: hell, I like how I look with my goatee, which I dreamed for years of growing--I didn't like most of the boys in my classes and could relate to girls easier partially because I matured faster, but I never disliked myself for being a boy and I am comfortable being referred to as a man--I'm equally comfortable being called a woman, though if I were honest, I do feel satisfied when people call me a woman, but that may be because I've only just started considering myself a woman and it feels validating.\n\nI have reached the point where I'm comfortable shopping for women clothes and heels (for the most part, and it was weird to see a pair of heels and desire them just because :)) and using female pronouns, and I will admit that once I put on thigh-highs and heels, I felt sexy--but at the same time, I'm okay with either smooth or hairy legs and I like my facial hair and my genitals (even if I think dicks are kind of ugly XD).\n\nUltimately, I just wind up feeling like a man and woman simultaneously and feel just as comfortable with fake breasts on and off, if that makes sense.\n\nTLDR: basically, given my history, I know I'm trans, but since I like both my male and female selves, I'm not sure if I should consider transitioning or not: my ideal would be to magically be able to switch whenever I wanted, but I'm not sure if it's because being male is what I'm used to or which one I'd want to present as primarily.\n\nI'm sorry for the length of this post.

The writer has been and will be living with their family until December. The writer is out to a small circle of close friends along with members of a trans and gnc support group, all of whom are supportive.\n\nMy suggestions to the writer are to create an outline which can help them stay on track and organize their thoughts, which can be especially difficult whilst feeling overwhelmed by anxiety and fear of rejection (however valid that may be). In addition, with people who are resistant in particular, keeping it simple yet keepinf the point clear and understandable is vital.\n\nHave you written a coming out letter or email to anyone or helped someone else with their own?

I thought it was like wishing for a unicorn, better to wish for a horse. \n\nI had sexual fantasies in which I was a guy, getting girls pregnant, and I never said anything because I thought every girl thought this way, and never said anything because, well, who talks about their sexual fantasies?\n\nRemember, this is the 1980s, and no one had ever heard of non-binary trans. I was in the San Francisco area, and even there it wasn't a thing. Trans guys weren't even a thing! It was just trans girls. Period. And this was during the bad old days of Harry Benjamin, when, in order to get HRT, you had to dump your old life (including spouse and family), relocate and live entirely as your target gender. And you couldn't be gay. You had to be straight once your transition was complete. If you weren't binary, if you didn't want to do this, you weren't trans enough to get ANY kind of treatment.\n\nMy husband began suggesting I try testosterone as long as 20 years ago. And would bring it up every once in a while when I was being particularly masc.\n\nIt wasn't until I stumbled on a wikipedia page for bi-gender that I finally figured it out. It was so clearly ME. After all of those years of not having a clue why I never fit. Why I always felt I wasn't female enough and why I always felt like someone was going to call me out as a \"fake woman.\" I knew something was not right, but because I didn't want to give up being a woman in order to be a man, I must not be trans, because the only options I knew of were MtF or FtM.\n\nWhen I came out to my (Millennial) kids, they said \"Yeah, we know. We didn't know by name what you were, but we never saw you just as a woman.\" \n\nWho else has had an experience like this?

I'm curious how much of my experience you guys relate to, or if you have stuff to add!\n\nI have personally experienced two completely separate subcategories of gender dysphoria throughout my lifetime. I have not been able to find previously coined words for them, so I am creating my own descriptive terms. Intrinsic physical dysphoria, and extrinsic emotional dysphoria\n\n\nThe first type of dysphoria is something I\u2019ll call intrinsic physical dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with a person\u2019s physical body not matching their own internal sense of gender. I call it intrinsic because it was completely fuelled by my own internal discomfort with my female body and the knowledge of the future implications of puberty. It started for me when I was around 12 years old, and I had a lot of trouble explaining at the time why I didn\u2019t want to have boobs or why the thought of menstruation basically terrified me. It went much further than being nervous about the changes of puberty; the problem was that my hormones were going to take my body in the opposite direction than I wanted it to go. I wanted more muscle and a more masculine frame! I was able to correct a large portion of this type of dysphoria by strength training and gaining muscle mass.\n\nDysphoria is a difficult thing to explain to people who have never experienced it. It\u2019s a very generalized feeling of discomfort with yourself, and there are going to be different triggers of it for everyone. We hear so frequently of it in the context of individuals who are transgender, in that they feel like they were born in the wrong body. Where my experience as a non binary individual is that my body just had a few tweaks necessary in order for me to be happy and content with it. I currently have no residual intrinsic physical dysphoria, other than those few days a year that my (already quite small) breasts feel just a little bit too large. I\u2019ve almost completely been able to take charge of it.\n\n\nThe second type of dysphoria I\u2019ll call extrinsic emotional dysphoria. It is the discomfort associated with being continuously told that you should behave a certain gendered way, but this attitude conflicts with your own internal gender identity. It is very different from the intrinsic physical dysphoria, because this type is caused by the words and expectations of other people. The unfortunate fact is that many people are very uncomfortable with individuals whose apparent sex and gender identities do not match. Imagine the funny looks that a man wearing a dress would get, or a woman with hairy legs. I call it being \u201cgender corrected\u201d; where people try to coach you through life, telling you what you need to change about your gender presentation in order to be perceived as normal. Some of this is well intentioned and some of it isn\u2019t, but the fact is that all of it fuels extrinsic emotional dysphoria. You feel like you only have two options in life. Either you conform to what other people expect and be miserable yourself, or you present your true self to the world and face all the judgement associated with it. I have unquestioningly chosen the second option; but it isn\u2019t an easy road. It is a road filled with emotional turmoil, feeling like a misfit, constantly wondering what others think of you, and then being glad that you can\u2019t read their minds. Because they probably think you\u2019re a weirdo too, just like all the other people seem to.\n\nI\u2019ve always been quite a self-confident person, but I\u2019ve found that over the years it gets harder to retain your self-confidence the more that people act like your gender identity is weird. Unfortunately for us nonbinary individuals, we can\u2019t change our internal feelings to make them match with the expectations of society. We can\u2019t change the fact that our society is a very gender binary one, and as such it tends to be confused by people like us. It\u2019s OK to be confused by other people who are different from you, but what\u2019s not OK is making them feel like outsiders or second class citizens. They are people just like you who deserve respect! \n\nBeing gender non binary is basically a compounded problem. You\u2019ve got your own intrinsic discomfort because your body may not match your own internal sense of gender. Then you\u2019ve got the extrinsic issues related to other people trying to tell you how to express your gender. It isn\u2019t an easy life to live. I love my life so much, but it would be dishonest with myself to not admit the extra challenges that being nonbinary has added to my life.\n\nI'd love to hear about your own individual experiences with dysphoria or if you have any thoughts about the way I have categorized dysphoria here.", "date": "2017-10-09 05:51:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7574zq/the_difference_between_intrinsic_and_extrinsic/", "author": "RoguePilot99"}, {"title": "Gender neutral workout?", "text": "Em again.

Every single reference to Jamie referenced them by name rather than pronoun.  It is very noticeable given it's awkwardness of repeating their name over and over again.

I'm currently a cashier and I'm hoping to become an illustrator in time, but for now all I can do is go by my chosen name, Aeron, and dress leaning a bit masculine(I'm AFAB). It does confuse people sometimes, but my voice always is a dead giveaway. I fall into the habit of pitching it up even higher unintentionally when trying to be friendly to customers, and it sounds all singsong-y too. So people usually end up going, \"hey girl!\" and \"ma'am\" at me and it sucks.\n\nI'm still too scared to tell any of my managers because I don't think any of them would get it.

I realized going on T probably won't really be worth it, because sometimes I have anxiety of kids getting super confused at me. It sounds silly, I know. I should be happy people get confused but when kids ask their parents if I'm a boy or a girl, or worse, they ask me, I get scared and I don't know how to answer. I know if I were on T this would be tenfold, and also...I'd probably start to be called a man all the time. There's also a few other reasons I hesitate to start hormones. I guess I'd like to check out other ways, first.\n\nGahh, I'm sorry, this is so all over the place. I guess it's mostly just venting. I wish there was more I could do.

Today this old guy just walked up to me and was rubbing my shoulder very slowly, and it was creepy. People still see me as female and treat me however they want sometimes.\n\nI'm not even sure what I'm asking. I guess I wanna know what I can do to help this without going on T.

So I sent an email writing that I wanted them to use they/them pronouns, and talking about it in terms of respect. If they respect me as a person, then they should respect my choice of pronouns. My dad wrote back and said \"sorry super busy will read later.\" Still nothing from Mom.\n\nThen I get an email that is definitely not meant for me.

In search of advice.", "text": "\n\nI'm not really sure if this is the right place to post this or not but I'm not really sure where else to go and I don't really know anyone in my life who can relate. \n\nQuick disclaimer and a little background; everyone in my life is super accepting and awesome. I'm a bi female which I realised years ago and everyone knows; I have a gay brother and my parents are more than supportive and honestly the best parents somebody could hope for. I have a lot of gay/bi friends and honestly don't think any of my friends are homophobic or transphobic at all. However if myself or anyone in my story does come across as intolerant it's probably just confusion of the situation and a lack of knowing anyone going through a similar thing so not fully understanding. \n\nSo recently I've been thinking i might be gender fluid. I'm super confused and have loads of questions and just thoughts and I apologise if this is just sort of ranting. \n\nSo some background, I've always sort of been a mixture of tomboy and girly, like I've never really fit in with either. I'm not sporty or into makeup (I know these are stereotypes but it's just sort of a good example?). In high school I went through stages of loving dresses and nothing else and times when I wore nothing but men's clothing. There was definitely a year or two when I did question my gender but realised I do enjoy being a girl so I couldn't be a guy (didn't really think about other options hahah). \n\nSo what got me thinking about it this time was about a month ago (I know it's not that long) my mum asked me about which I would chose if I could come back in another life as a male or female. She said female and I argued male, because as much as I love being a woman I'd love to see the other side of things, plus don't you have those days when you just feel like a male? She just looked at me confused and said no I don't have those days (again not judging just confused). This got me thinking about my gender for the first time in a while and I was like wait do people not have those days when they want to be a boy? I thought everyone had that. \nThe next dayI had an event to go to where I needed to wear a dress and it got me all anxious and nervous and so I was messaging a friend just ranting and saying how I don't feel like wearing a dress and why are my boobs here I just want them to go away. She responded confused like what do you mean, your boobs are awesome? I said yeah some days I do really love them but I'm just having one of those times when I don't want them there at all. She was confused and saying how no she'd never felt that. I too was confused, again asking doesn't everyone just have those days and these thoughts?? \nLater that week after I'd been thinking about these things, I was dressed in baggy pants and a T with some friends who were loving how androgynous I look and I was like yeah I feel like a boy it's awesome. Then a friend said half jokingly something like 'why aren't you just non binary' and it was like everything in my life just clicked. Yes actually that does sound kind of right. That would explain a lot. Is that me? \n\nIt explains why I have days feeling like a male when others don't feel that. Or why I feel like my breasts don't belong on my body sometimes; or why when everyone looked at models and felt bad about themselves I loved my androgynous look and didn't care for a typical female body (or one at all?) I always wanted to grow a beard, and Is my penis envy just about being able to pee wherever or is there more to it? \n\nI then went into full panic mode for about a week. I know nothing about this, what does it mean? Who even am I now?? \nI started reading a bunch of non binary blogs and definitions and just whatever I could find and felt like gender fluid fit me the best. Some days female, some days male, some days in between. Yep that basically sums up my whole life and why one day I hate hate hate dresses and heels and the next I'm like this is so fun I feel so fancy! \n\nBut now I'm just sort of stuck and lost. I'm not sure what I'm meant to do now? What I'm meant to think about to know if this is right or if not why am I having these thoughts?\n\nEverything has suddenly become harder too, a month ago I got up felt like a dress and put it on and it was great; or felt like baggy pants and an oversize shirt and loved the occasional questioning look I got. I'd be out and knew I looked like a boy but it didn't matter. Now I go out and I'm sort of trying to actually pull of being a boy, like I want people to think that and then suddenly I feel weird when people know I'm a girl, or I feel weird because I go to the female bathrooms and I'm trying to be a boy? \nIn some ways it's been freeing like I've been wearing a sports bra with this singlet over and makes me so flat chested and I feel amazing, but then at the same time I'm nervous to run into somebody cos I look like a boy, even though it's exactly how I dressed before??  \n\nI know a lot of what I've been saying has been related to clothing and I get that that isn't what defines genderqueer or trans people but it's been when getting dressed that I've felt most these things.  \n\nIve spoken to a couple friends who were all like yeah you're only just thinking this? (I seriously thought everyone had these thoughts and I never second guessed the actual thoughts!) \n\nI don't know what I'm meant to do from here either. My friends either are or will be supportive but they can only really listen not offer help. I messaged this friend of a friend who I've meet a couple times who has some genderqueer friends and she said we could all meet as a group but I'm not sure if any are (female at birth? Is that a correct term? I don't wanna be offensive and nothing against males at birth I just want somebody who fully gets everything like chest dysphoria). \nI just feel so clueless and lost. I thought I knew who I was and now I don't know how to dress myself or present myself and my anxiety is going though the roof, like it has not been this bad in two years. \nIm having so many new thoughts and feelings; the other day I was putting a skirt on and I felt like I was a boy who was dressing as a girl but wanted to dress as a girl. That's definitely a new feeling. \n\nI don't know if I've really asked a question or if any of this is even coherent and I'm not sure what I'm really looking for. I guess just general advice or maybe I just needed a place to let this all out. I'm not sure. But any response is appreciated and thanks so much to anyone who read all the way to the end. \nThanks everyone for support! \n", "date": "2017-10-19 03:01:39", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77bsdf/thinking_i_might_be_gender_fluid_in_search_of/", "author": "hereandmaybequeer"}, {"title": "a sub for enby aces", "text": "", "date": "2017-10-19 03:59:12", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77c2nv/a_sub_for_enby_aces/", "author": "jayxthexhuman"}, {"title": "bored jay was bored", "text": "", "date": "2017-10-19 04:00:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77c2xx/bored_jay_was_bored/", "author": "jayxthexhuman"}, {"title": "imagine two wings looking at each other across the body of the bird that they are \u201cpart\u201d of...", "text": "", "date": "2017-10-19 13:36:30", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77eet0/imagine_two_wings_looking_at_each_other_across/", "author": "birdyfullmoon"}, {"title": "Q&amp;A with Bebe Beretta, 27, is Nonbinary, Genderfluid, and Wants More LGBTQ Folks to Connect", "text": "", "date": "2017-10-19 18:08:55", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77g8ru/qa_with_bebe_beretta_27_is_nonbinary_genderfluid/", "author": "Snoodle987"}, {"title": "cis logic", "text": "cis people: \"you NEED to disclose that you're transgender AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!\"\n\ncis people: \"no, not if you're non-binary. that just confuses people.\"\n\nthat's code for \"you need to tell people that you don't have the genitals they expect but if you tell them you're non-binary they don't know your genitals and how can you talk to someone without knowing their genitals???\"", "date": "2017-10-20 04:09:53", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77jsd7/cis_logic/", "author": "jayxthexhuman"}, {"title": "Can Someone Answer this?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2017-10-20 09:44:11", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77l2l3/can_someone_answer_this/", "author": "xmanual"}, {"title": "Looking for peeps with similar experiences/goals (NSFW for frank body part discussion)", "text": "Hey everyone! So basically, I want to physically transition, but I'm too scared... even in nb people I see transition, I just don't see people whose goals match my goals? It feels like nb people transition to presenting as the opposite binary gender, or so that they look gender ambiguous in a \"no visibly gendered characteristics\" way which is cool for them, but it makes me feel kind of alone.\n\nIs there anyone out there that wants \"mixed\" gendered characteristics? Like, a \"male\"-read voice and breasts? Or curves and a beard? Or anything really, that reads as visibly non-cis? If you don't feel comfortable with details, even a \"I'm like that!\" would make me feel less weird, honestly. And if you do have such traits I'd really appreciate stories about how it affects your daily life (like work and going down the shops) and country, if you're comfortable with it. Obviously things change hugely even in the same country/state depending on where you live, but it'd be nice to get some perspective.\n\nI personally live in a pretty progressive area I believe? Australia, major city. There's even an \"X\" gender marker available! =) I probably have no right to be complaining- I'm a (young) legal adult and I live with my family who think trans people are jokes, but would never kick me out (parent knows I'm trans). But I worry about practicalities (mostly work). I'm afab, but have a (regrettably small) amount of beard hair due to the luck of genetics. Before I grew it I hated facial hair but loved it on me because it looked \"male\", and now I love facial hair, lol. I feel like it isn't noticeable *enough* but I've gotten comments from a co-worker \"politely\" telling me about her laser hair removal place, which cheers me up. As for future goals, I am genderfluid and my dysphoria shifts, but I always want a deep voice and \"downstairs\" growth. I kind of want to go on full T, then once permanent changes have happened go on low T or no T. I say kind of because I desperately want \"male\" stuff *yesterday* but I'm scared to even talk to doctors, cause of severe social anxiety and fear of regret. Being nonbinary really embarrasses me too... I'm fine talking about it on the internet, but the thought of it in real life... ugh Anyway! Chest-wise, I hate the thought of being unconscious around strangers, let alone being visibly non-cis, but if I get it I'd get a breast reduction not a removal. Even at my current size binding with a sports bra would be enough if I were more androgynous. I love colourful girly clothes and kind of hate the thought of giving up skirts and dresses since I hated them/never wore them as a kid/teen due to their \"girl\" association (not that I wear them much *now* - I'm unwilling to shave, but hairy as FUCK and embarrassed about it) but idk if I'd have the confidence to keep wearing them post-T. Doesn't help I'd probably be even hairier - I'm unwilling to shave but I'm seriously not kidding when I say I'm seriously hairy. I have feet hairs and a bit of a complex, and am scared of being ugly (if I shaved I'd be considered really attractive by woman standards, so I feel really bad about wanting to transition).\n\nAlso, does anyone know a word for this sort of transition, similar to transfeminine/transmasculine? It'd be helpful to know so I can seek out similar experiences. I know there's transneutral, but I'm kind of under the impression that it refers more to the \"ambiguous\" type presentation?\n\nEdit: Thank you to everyone that has replied. :)", "date": "2017-10-20 12:06:47", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77ln7l/looking_for_peeps_with_similar_experiencesgoals/", "author": "tired-nb"}, {"title": "Its me", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2017-10-20 20:49:33", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77oyxf/its_me/", "author": "ValeOpenBob"}, {"title": "Can anyone here help me?

I'm 22 and AMAB, pretty much always assumed that I was male since I didn't see anything that I thought constituted dysphoria or anything.\n\nThese past few weeks I've been seriously questioning myself in terms of gender and I'm not sure if what I've been feeling really counts as dysphoria.\n\nLike, when I see myself in a mirror nothing about me really feels 'wrong', I'm just sort of indifferent to it.

Softer skin, curvier, breasts, etc...\n\nEven then I also enjoy some of my masculine traits and without trying to blow my own horn I think I make somewhat of a good looking guy.\n\nI've never really been particularly masculine anyway and someone recently used a female pronoun when talking to me which made me feel quite nice.\n\nAll this being said I don't 'feel' female and I don't want to undergo a transition because I feel like I'd be committing myself to the other extreme when I don't feel like I'd get much of a benefit from it.\n\nIs it wrong that I sorta want to be androgynous with some feminine traits? I feel that even if I'm not male, I can't really come out to my parents (I still can't admit to them that I'm bisexual).\n\nSorry for the wall of text but I have to ask, does anything that I've written here come of as dysphoria? I'm super confused here, and was wondering if anyone could offer any insight/ advice into exploring myself further, and finding proper answers?\n\nThanks :)\n\nIf you want me to expand on something, or be more specific about something please feel free to ask, I feel like I should be an open book here so that there's no misunderstanding.", "date": "2017-10-21 08:34:04", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/77sadf/can_anyone_here_help_me_im_sorta_new_to_this_and/", "author": "ranmaster"}, {"title": "Every time I think I know who and what I am, something shifts again.", "text": "Here we go again, another shift. I can't figure out if it's gender shifts for my being bi-gender, or still working out who I am.\n\nI don't know if it makes sense, but I feel like I *am a guy* who wants to be a girl. Even though I am a physical female, raised female, lived female for 47 years, I also feel like I want to be a girl and am not. It feels so natural to switch to testosterone and get bottom surgery, etc. It feels right. But I desperately, desperately want to be a girl, I much prefer to be a girl, and I have this sense I will never be one.\n\nYesterday I had my first female-fail (4 months, 1 week on T). By my wife. We went out for a family dinner last night in two vehicles, and I arrived first. When my wife arrived, she looked in the window of the restaurant and could only see us from the shoulders up. She said she saw my sons sitting with another guy. She straight up didn't recognize me without my more femme body (huge boobs, femme clothes).\n\nI thought I was fairly settled in my bi-gender identification, letting my inner femme girl and my inner masc guy each have what they need the most to be dysphoria-free.\n\nFor the last week or so I've been considering a full transition (not the first time). I want to be a guy, physically, but my femme side is very adamant that I don't want to look like a guy. I want a flat chest. I want full bottom surgery (meta) to be fully a guy inside my pants. \n\nYet the other part of me still wants to be all girl. I want to keep my inner lady parts, a sexually functional vagina, I want to keep my boobs (and even get a lift so they're perky and pretty again without assistance from a bra). I want to wear my pretty skirts and tops and my (obsessively assembled) dangly earring collection. But I can't figure out if that side of me really wants these things, or if I just don't want to give up my cis privilege and deal with the social ramifications.\n\nSo my female fail had me looking in the mirror, looking for what my wife saw. And I saw it. First, I don't really like what the male me looks like. Partly he looks too much like my bio-father (long story there), and partly he's just not how I see myself as a guy. I'm unconventionally pretty as a girl, but as a guy, ugh.  But he's growing on me, and more and more I see myself heading in that direction.\n\nI'm not androgynous. Not at all. I do not even want to try an androgynous look. I'm really, really binary for a non-binary person. I don't like to mix them in a way to cause people to see me in that way, because I don't see me that way. \n\nIf I could, I'd deep-six my masc side in a heartbeat so I can be all girl, all the time. I mostly identify with my female side, despite identifying with guys more than girls in general. I feel like I'm one of them, but my heroes and role models are female figures, - mostly gender non-conforming female role models. If I could be Xena or Hercules (90s TV version) I'd be Xena, never Herc. I want to be an Amazon warrior woman, not a Spartan warrior guy.

This is my first time on Reddit in several months, mostly because while the site's user base is too diverse to be stereotyped accurately, I kept either getting into fights or witnessing fights regardless of what subreddit I visited. Anyway...\n\nThis post isn't about any abuse I've experience or witnessed in my own social life. In fact, that's a major part of the reason I decided to write this post. A trans feminist blogger I admire reblogged a conversation on Tumblr that began with one person's observation that they met more AFAB nonbinary people than AMAB nonbinary people, whereas most of the transfeminine people they knew were full-on trans women. Someone replied with a fairly long response stating, among other things, that most AFAB people who claimed a nonbinary identity were either trans men using an excuse to intrude upon women's spaces or cis women appropriating trans experiences because of their own internalized misogyny. She added that social forces (trans and nonbinary communities, the world as a whole, perhaps both) viewed transmasculine people as \"the best of both worlds\" and transfeminine people, correspondingly, as combining negative \"male\" and negative \"female\" stereotypes. She concluded that because most transmasculine people are aware of this privilege, the \"NB community is almost entirely AFAB.\" Then another person\u2014a AFAB NB person, for that matter\u2014reblogged to add that their own people were an \"appallingly badly behaved group.\"\n\nNow, I make this post for a couple of reasons. First, I am an AFAB NB person myself (in case you couldn't tell) who has had a conflicting and complex history with their own gender presentation. Second, those experiences contrast sharply with my own. It's true that I have met more openly nonbinary AFAB people than openly nonbinary AMAB people, but I have *never* met any nonbinary person who objectified or belittled trans women, tried to exclude them, or attempted to take advantage of male privilege and trans experiences simultaneously.\n\nNow I pose questions to the AMAB nonbinary people on this subreddit. Do you, in your social lives, experience abusive behavior from AFAB nonbinary people? Do AFAB people dominate among the nonbinary people you know? If the answer to the previous question is yes, then why do you think so? Is it possible to be nonbinary without being transmasculine if you're AFAB or transfeminine if you're AMAB? \n\nThe remaining question, though, is how someone *knows* that someone else is not a nonbinary person but a man pretending not to be a man or a cis woman expressing internalized misogyny. What criteria would anyone have to meet in order to merit a designation as a real nonbinary person as opposed to a self-loathing cis woman? If you think you know the answer, please tell me; I'm dying to know.\n\nThank you.

Femininity, on the other hand, was difficult. I was an undeniable tomboy but my parents pushed me really hard to be girly. All my friends in middle and high school pushed me too. I'd get bullied if I dressed in my t-shirts and jeans, I'd get bullied if I tried to dress girly and didn't pull it off. I always admired male fashion but I couldn't express that in any way. I was stuck, uncomfortable, and terribly repressed. It made me confused about who I was and I was always in a constant state of \"what the fuck am I.\"\n\nI'm in my 20s now. I identify strictly as a lesbian. In my teens I tried really hard to fight off my sexuality just as much as I fought off my personality. I pushed myself to look girly and I wanted guys to be attracted to me. I sought out guys that looked like they'd be generally desirable and I had sex with a couple of them. I wanted to prove to myself and everyone else that I was a straight girl. It wasn't until I was 20 when I finally let myself be who I am.\n\nFast forward to today: I'm a happy andro lesbian who gets to wear mens clothes and I get to have sex in the masculine position (yay strap ons). Here's where my problem is. My gf wants me to be submissive in the female position. I have no fucking clue why that makes me feel so anxious. She knows about my history with guys and she doesn't understand why I won't let her penetrate me if I let guys do it in the past. Thing is, it just doesn't feel right.

One day I was wearing this outfit that made me look more like a boy, and my mom questioned me and asked me if I'm transgender or trying to be like a boy. Other things have happened with my dad questioning my gender. At first I just thought \"well I'm comfortable with she/her and my name and my body, so I'm female I guess\". well then I started to think about it. In the past, people have mistaken me for a boy or said I look like a boy. And in a way, I enjoyed it.

I would typically ask them these questions face to face, but I would like to find information on my own so I can be a better support system and come in with some outside knowledge.

Previously they have expressed interest in men and have never mentioned an interest in women, with being NonBinary does sexual fluidity typically come along with it?

Which thinking back, that's kinda crazy I would come up with something like that.

My parents are not transphobes, but are not very well informed about the topic (and their education on non-binary stuff is 0). This is the translation of the email I might send in a near future (translated from Catalan, our language):\n\n&gt; Dear family,\n&gt; \n&gt; Today I'm writing to you to explain something that, for me, is very special and important. It's something so personal that I have re-written this email many times. I have never found the courage to say it in a face-to-face conversation. I guess I'll go straight to the point, which is the easiest way to explain difficult things.\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm non-binary.\n&gt; \n&gt; I don't know if you expected that, I suppose not. In fact, you probably don't know what does that mean, so I'll explain it: \"non-binary\" (it's always used as an adjective) is a gender identity that describes those people who are not boys or girls. It does not refer to the sex (which is defined by the chromosomes) but to the gender. Maybe you suspected that I'm somewhere inside the LGBTI+ acronym (by the way, I'm also bisexual. But that's another thing!). I don't expect you to understand that immediately... it was difficult for me too!\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not a new thing for me. I have already said in the beginning that I have been thinking how to tell you for a long time, how to \"come out\". You don't just wake up someday and decide to be non-binary. I don't know why I'm like this, but whatever reasons are there, that's how I am! I discovered the non-binary label approximately one year and a half ago, but I have older memories of me feeling some king of \"rejection\" towards the word \"boy\" when it was meant to represent me. And I asked to myself for a long time the famous question: \"Who am I\"? For some time, I considered the possibility of being a trans girl, but I dismissed it. So, you know. Non-binary was what was left once I saw that I was neither a boy nor a girl.\n&gt; \n&gt; The word \"non-binary\" falls under the \"transgender\" umbrella term, because a trans person is somebody with a gender identity that is differemt from the assigned gender at birth. Now that you read this word, you might want to ask me whether I plan on transtitioning, that is, undergoing all this hormones and sex reassignment surgery stuff. The answer is no. It's true that it would be cool to have a less masculine appearence (although not more feminine), but my current body is not *that* annoying.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ask you a single thing: avoid all expressions that could imply that I'm a boy (or a girl) when you talk about me. This really annoys me. Try to use a neutral language. I don't have a problem with my current pronouns (\"Ell\" is ok in Catalan. In English I prefer singular \"they\", though), but I'm talking about other expressions that include words such as boy, man, guy and similars. I know that it's difficult in a language like Catalan, where the grammatical gender is so important, but I will be very happy if you make the effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; I'm sorry I've been hiding it all this time; I don't like hiding stuff from you. I'm kind of afraid of your reaction, specially when we meet again in person, because I have no idea about what could it be. I hope it's a good reaction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, so that's the surprise of the week! Kisses and hugs for all of you :)\n&gt; \n&gt; [My name]\n\n----\n\nWhat do you think?

I'm a non-native English speaker, so when I first heard of 'singular they' I was a bit shocked but also thrilled. Something that I love about English is that it's pretty gender-neutral, so I think it's great making it more gender-neutral.\nSo, my question is if here's any Spanish speakers (or Portuguese, French, or basically any Latin language) and how do you face the binary gender issue in our language? I'm a Spanish native speaker and I hate how gendered it is, most adjectives and nouns are gendered (in French even some verbs, like when you conjugate in past, like 'je suis all\u00e9e'), and pronouns, all third person pronouns are gendered (\u00e9l, ella, ellos, ellas). I'm not non-binary, but I hate always having to make those gender decisions when I speak, on one hand because I could be forcing a gender to someone and make them feel uncomfortable, and also because whenever I have to talk about a group of people I have to use male pronouns, adjectives and nouns, and I feel that I'm leaving out everyone who's non-male (as a woman, I've always felt left out when my teachers said 'todos' instead of 'todos y todas').\nAbout this in Spanish I've seen 3 solutions:\n1. Always use the male and female counterparts together, like 'todas y todos', 'compa\u00f1eras y compa\u00f1eros', but this does not include non-binary people, it's still gendered.\n2. Avoid gendered words and use genderless ones instead, like saying 'estudiantes' instead of 'alumnos' which I try to do as much as I can, and that's the problem, you can't always find a genderless word for what you want to say.\n3. When writing, use an 'x' or 'e' instead of the 'o' or 'a', like 'compa\u00f1erxs', 'todes', etc. When speaking, you can't say 'compa\u00f1erxs', but you can say 'compa\u00f1eres', so it's pretty good, but it's still hard to do because our language is too binary (AND SEXIST) and it still doesn't solve the pronoun issue. I guess I could say 'elles' instead of 'ellos/ellas' (although I've actually never heard it, so I don't know if it's a thing), but what do I do when I have to use singular pronouns? What's the genderless version of '\u00e9l/ella'? I guess I could just use the person's name, but it bothers me that Spanish lacks genderless pronouns.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts on this? I really want to neutralize my language, and I'm trying to get rid of gender when I speak as much as I can, but I still have a lot of situations where I have no idea on how to do it, especially because I haven't seen so much discussion about this in Spanish as I've seen in English (and we really need to talk more about this!).", "date": "2017-11-06 14:44:44", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7b5jmh/about_genderless_use_of_language_in_latin/", "author": "valherquin"}, {"title": "Just returned from a week long silent Buddhist meditation retreat", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-11-06 18:43:22", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7b768r/just_returned_from_a_week_long_silent_buddhist/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "the gifts of Transgender identity", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-11-06 19:09:29", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7b7chv/the_gifts_of_transgender_identity/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "So I did the predictive text origin story thing and, well...", "text": "I was born to be a trans gender gender and gender gender identity gender gender and gender gender identity gender gender and gender gender identity gender gender and gender...\n\nMaybe I\u2019ve been over thinking things.

This is really just a bit of a \u201cdoes anyone else\u201d, borne of idle curiosity. I'm not confused or on a quest for self understanding (this says nothing about those who are, it's just not a personal goal I share). \n\nSo, relevant background information: Internally, I experience life as a \u201cshapeshifter\u201d, simply for lack of a better term. I have since as far back as I can reliably remember of childhood. I'm a scientist and not particularly fantasy-prone so I don't derive greater supernatural meaning from that fact. I assume there's some overly-sensitive-empathy related mechanism in play. But in short, my mind runs what you could think of as continuous, detailed simulations of well \u2013 anything and everything. I experience a constant flow of other people and beasts (both real and fictional) and whatever other chronenburg/ chimera bits of shape and behavior that my brain feels like experiencing. It's brain simulations, I know. But it's realistic enough that it leaves me with a distinct and always-present feeling of what I can only describe as being...as if I were quite literally a shapeshifter who coincidentally happens to be human shaped in the present moment. I live with that feeling every moment of every day and I don't have a better way to articulate it. \n\nI am, as a result, rather an adept actor and chameleon. I spent my internal life as a mimicking, echoing, flickering, shapeshifting...neutral thing. A curious, chaotic, empathetic blob of everyone and everything I encounter. A disembodied cheshire grin. \n\nAnd that's all relevant because, as might be obvious, literally nothing about that experience is gendered. Not even a little. I spend my days as literally anything, without regard for gender and it makes it impossible to internalize gender as \u201cself\u201d.\n\nEasy: agender and move on, yes? And I suppose that's accurate. But I struggle to relate to agender stories as I generally hear them, because I'm not dysphoric about body or pronouns. The body I have feels no more right and no more wrong than any other shape it could possibly be. Same for the pronouns that go along with that body, which I perceive as only a reference to my physical sex. The only sense of unease I feel is that of being in a static form  - ANY static form \u2013 with a mind/ internal identity alight with constant flickering change. The body I posses feels fully irrelevant to that experience, if that makes any sense. No pronoun change or body modification or different presentation would mean anything to me because I relate to all of them about equally. Which is to say, not at all. \n\nTL;DR I just exist in the body I exist in. And that's fine and I have nothing against it. But I can't internalize anything about it because it \u201cfeels\u201d transient even though it's not. Any body would feel the same.

I have no dysphoria about my genitals and am deciding if breasts are something I want.\n\nBecause I am about to turn 26 I am actively seeking a doctor to discuss my possibilities for treatments the could help me appear more androgynous.

I am still in the process of coming out to people, and in figuring out my presentation. I'm only like ~5-10% at most maybe so far into properly discovering my voice still. There are some obvious feminine things I do like paint my nails and wear make-up and women's sweaters etc, but at the moment I am basically read as male.\n\n\nI'm doing music in school. Of my current 3 main teachers, I'm out to 1 of them, no, 2 now, as of today. 1 was my primary singing teacher. Number 2, today, was the teacher of a chamber choir I sing in.\n\n\nSo as I mentioned, I sing in a chamber choir, something like ~16 people. SATB (soprano alto tenor bass). We sing arranged in a horseshoe pattern arranged from lowest parts to highest parts. I'm in the tenor 2 section maybe 3 \"guys\" out from the middle, opposite the girls.. Anyway.\n\n\nWe have a performance coming up next week.\n\n\n\"Ladies, all black. Men, you know the drill. Black slacks, white shirt, black bowtie.\"\n\n\nI asked after class if I could wear all black. He said if I had a reason for it he'd hear me out. So I nervously came out to him and told him why. But I also considered the situation a bit, out loud, when talking with him. That the break in the color pattern could draw attention that I'm not necessarily seeking. That I imagined it probably wouldn't be possible to re-position me to the end of the tenors, in the middle, to avoid this visual pattern break (he confirmed this, I mustn't leave my designated position). But he was still willing to let me wear all black if I decided I wanted to, given my reason. Told me to think about it.\n\n\nUpon starting to think about it, my mind went here:\n\n\nIs there a way I can wear the same color pallette as the men surrounding me, but just sort of subtly make my outfit a bit more feminine? Maybe if there's a female equivalent of that outfit... Differently fitting pants and shirt, maybe some kinda black ribbony thing instead of a bowtie..? I don't know..\n\n\n(I don't know how far I'd want to take it, but it did also just occur to me that I do also own a nice black skirt that goes past the knee. Maybe if I knew just what else to wear with that, that matches the guy color pallette..? Hmm, would black leggings make sense perhaps in that situation also to possibly reduce the \"distraction\" level? To be honest I have not yet really figured out how color combinations and everything works in girl mode fashion yet.. Maybe I'm just being extra careful.. I feel like the \"boymode\" or \"nonbinary\" outfits I randomly throw together everyday are very well color combo'd... I'm rambling...)\n\n", "date": "2017-11-07 03:30:23", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7bajh8/can_one_somewhat_feminize_genderneutralize_the/", "author": "Birl42"}, {"title": "Helping my nonbinary boyfriend", "text": "My boyfriend has recently figured out he is nonbinary.

At first, it seemed like a very good thing.  My dysphoria seemed to be lifting.  But now that I've settled into passing completely as male, and the newness of it is gone, I find that I can hardly relate to most men, much less women.  I'm now perceived as the gender that I feel more like, but I don't actually feel more understood.  Sometimes I think that getting sterilized gave me more relief than testosterone did, because what bothered me the most about my female body was the ticking time bomb threat of pregnancy, potential that I absolutely didn't want.  Testosterone gave me features I wanted, like a V shape, some muscles, a lower voice, and better-regulated emotions.  But the thing is that sex is so incredibly important to me that I think that looking back, I might have forgone those things to be more sexually desirable.  I think that being sexually undesirable, for me, is roughly as painful as gender dysphoria.  \n\nI feel like the way I am keeps happiness forever out of my reach.  I always worry that my parents made me transgender because they were conservative religious morons, and I often do thought experiments to see if I could have turned out differently.  I often feel like the numerous benefits of being cisgender are waved in my face and that I'm locked out of having a normal life, like I'm peering into a beautiful snowglobe from the outside.  I see groups of men and groups of women who feel solidarity with each other because they have some intuitive knowledge about manhood and womanhood that I lack.  I see happy couples, straight and gay, and hear love songs on the radio about gender relations.  Guys trying to be social with me say dude-bro stuff and I just don't feel the connection.  Before I transitioned and girls used to treat me as 'one of the girls,' I also didn't feel the connection.  I feel like I'm way too weird for most people, almost like an alien.  I only like to talk about weird things.  I feel like there's a wall between me and others- never a connection or mutual understanding.  When I peer into my future, the fog is very thick; I don't really want the rest of my lifespan, but society forces me to live it.

I\u2019m new here. Wanted a place to vent about stuff that\u2019s been going on in my head recently, and was wondering if other people have ever felt the same. \n\nI\u2019ve recently started to be more open about my nonbinary identity, and have started to accept it more and start to explore it a bit. I started feeling like I wasn\u2019t cis about 6 years ago but mostly kept it to myself and felt very ashamed of it in that time, which I think is part of the reason I find it so hard to talk about now. \n\nI came out a few months ago to a select group of close friends, and to my partner. The support I received was amazing and I felt great, for the first time I actually felt validated and accepted. I also joined a lot of nonbinary facebook groups on a fake account so people I\u2019m not out to yet didn\u2019t see, and got talking to a lot of lovely strangers. \n\nThe problem is, starting to accept myself and talk about my identity seems to have brought me a whole load of different problems from the ones I had when I was hiding it. Now I\u2019ve started coming out, I just want to come out to everyone and start my transition, but 1) I don\u2019t feel safe coming out to a lot of people, 2) my anxiety is preventing me from coming out to people I would feel safe with, 3) I\u2019m feeling increasingly depressed that I can\u2019t transition immediately/can\u2019t transition in the way I want to. My dysphoria has got far worse, and I just keep thinking about how angry and miserable I am that my gender isn\u2019t legally recognised. I live in the UK, and our government is currently discussing reforming the gender recognition act from 2004 to make it easier for binary trans people to legally change their genders, but there\u2019s no mention of whether it will include changes for nonbinary people too. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I want to go on hormones, I kinda want top surgery, I definitely 100% at least want a reduction, but the doctors will likely refuse to give me a reduction because of my weight so that\u2019s another thing I have to wait for. I was thinking about asking to be referred to a gender identity clinic, but I\u2019m not sure how much help it\u2019d be when I\u2019m unsure of what I want to do when it comes to transitioning, and also I\u2019m scared my doctor would just laugh at me and tell me I\u2019m not trans. Transitioning physically also concerns me because my boyfriend is cis and straight so I wonder how he\u2019d feel about it, although he\u2019s been really supportive so far. \n\nI\u2019m also worried about how I\u2019m ever going to come out to my family. I live with them at the moment and it\u2019s difficult constantly being misgendered. My sister sort of knows that I\u2019m not cis but she\u2019s made her opinions on nonbinary people very clear (\u201cstupid tumblr snowflakes wanting to feel special/following a trend\u201d \u201cthey/them are grammatically incorrect pronouns\u201d \u201cyou have a vagina so you\u2019re female\u201d etc etc). So she doesn\u2019t use my pronouns or acknowledge me as nonbinary. My mum is worse, she constantly uses slurs when referring to trans people, she once refused to let me go stay at a friend\u2019s house who was a trans girl because \u201cI don\u2019t want you getting involved in any weird tranny sex parties\u201d. She also tends to take the attitude of \u201cI\u2019ll do what I want whether you like it or not\u201d, I\u2019ve asked her repeatedly to please call me Abi or the nickname my sister and brother call me instead of Abigail, but she refuses and still calls me Abigail. I was thinking about potentially coming out to my family after I move out, although I\u2019m not sure when that\u2019ll be. I\u2019m 20 but can\u2019t work at the moment because of my mental health issues, so don\u2019t have the money to move out. \n\nI\u2019m just kinda finding life in general really hard and really really wishing I could just be cis at the moment. I\u2019ve thought about just trying to fake it like I used to and seeing if I can get by pretending to be a girl because it\u2019d make life so much easier if I could. I\u2019m angry and frustrated at the world and feel like I\u2019m just helpless while people in positions of power debate whether I should legally be allowed to exist, while strangers laugh at my pronouns and identity, while my family talk about how trans people are attention seeking, confused or perverts. It just makes me want to isolate myself and never have to face another person again. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading whatever this mess of thoughts and feelings is.

I came to realisation that maybe I'm not just jealous of their styles and presentations, I\u2019m actually envious of their gender.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well that led to some self reflective soul searching. Am I non binary to some extent? I never came to any sort of answer. I do identify with female as a gender, which is pretty binary, but I also sometimes don\u2019t? It\u2019s not like I ever identify with male, or agender or something along those lines. But I read a brief questionnaire that asked if my gender fluctuated between different intensities whilst staying the same relative identity, and I\u2019d never thought of it before but yeah it kinda does. That\u2019s something like genderflux? So that would make me femme flux? Demigirl? Transfeminine flux? I dunno what even.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gender is complicated. Or it isn\u2019t. Gee I don\u2019t know anything anymore.\n\n.\n\n&gt; Further to the non binary musings. I\u2019ve also felt disappointed that I am binary (am I though?) and that I was letting someone down. I\u2019ve never really vocalised that to anyone though, because binary identities are valid, and I\u2019m not letting anyone down. But I still feel it.\n&gt;\n&gt; When filling out forms that ask for gender if there\u2019s only male or female I will always, without hesitation, choose female. But if there\u2019s a greater selection, like for example MtF, FtM, Male, Female, Non Binary. I will hesitate between choosing MtF or Female, like I don\u2019t want to recognise my AMAB past, but Female isn\u2019t completely accurate either. Or if they ask are you a man or a woman, I know I\u2019m not a man, but I also hesitate on woman. How can I be female but not a woman?\n&gt;\n&gt; I have often brushed these thoughts aside, nah if I were non binary I\u2019d know, I\u2019d identify with the label more. I\u2019d not feel female. I am binary I\u2019d tell myself, feeling that disappointment at the back of mind. Like, I know, but what if\u2026\n&gt;\n&gt; I mean, these are similar feelings I felt before transitioning, to convince myself not to. Not as strong or as well defined, but similar nonetheless.\n&gt;\n&gt; But what does it mean? There are so many labels and names and identities it\u2019s confusing and I don\u2019t find any particularly alluring. I wouldn\u2019t even know where to begin if I were non binary.\n&gt;\n&gt; I\u2019ve always celebrated non binary people and their identities and fought for their inclusion into trans communities, is it just because I feel that inclusion and diversity is superior to exclusion, or is there more?\n&gt;\n&gt; I\u2019ve always known and celebrated that gender binary construct is an artifice of what is really a spectrum, probably not even a one dimensional spectrum (ie: sliding from one side to another) at that. So why do I feel, if I feel disappointment in being binary not allow myself the freedom of such a spectrum? Is it societal? Is it my own low self worth in play here, only allowing me so much freedom but no more?\n&gt;\n&gt; I still have more questions and than answers. I have no answers at all really. Well, no, I do know that transitioning was the right thing to do, I know I am not male or anywhere on that part of the spectrum. So that is something I suppose.", "date": "2017-11-11 06:07:06", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7c6ty6/asking_myself_some_complicated_questions_would/", "author": "GalileoAce"}, {"title": "Hi r/NonBinary, I really need your help.

Soon to be 19. \nI have been out as male for more than one year and have only started with the Gender Clinic. \nAfter being out as male I start to discover much more to my gender identity and who I am, what causes my dysphoria, what I'm able to handle, etc. \nLong story short, I have always wanted to have a child of my own. They've given me the option to freeze my eggs, but the procedure freaks me out I can't stomach it... I really can't... it leaves me lightheaded, and it just doesn't feel right anyone... well... I can't... \n\nI have done some research on fertility and hormones. Obviously I will never be able to tell how much of my fertility starting male hormones can affect, but I've heard of cases where people have taken themselves off T and have successfully resumed ovulation. \n\nI'm wanting to give it a go, because if it's possible then I would rather carry than freeze my eggs, which I really cannot bring myself to do as the thought causes me emotional distress. I can't even see a gynaecologist for the same reasons. I'm okay with my original plumbing and prefer it sexually. But the... checkups and surgeries... I can't do it. \n\nThis aside. Is anyone with the NHS? Do the NHS supply you with hormones? If so, how will I be able to freely take myself off hormones temporarily to try and conceive without the NHS denying me treatment? I know they will, they only care about the money after all, but the idea of being unable to conceive will emotionally shatter me. \n\nAlready I'm feeling suicidal thinking of this. The NHS and never being on hormones again all because I wanted to have a baby.. it f*cking hurts. I'm not sure if anyone here is wanting something similar, or is deciding to go off T for other personal reasons. Does anyone know what I could possibly do? What are my options? Is it possible to take myself off them over an agreement and be able to resume treatment when necessary? \n\nI don't want to force myself to stay on T and destroy my chances of being fertile enough to carry a child of my own. I was thinking of taking hormones until my voice deepens, my shoulders broaden and certain areas grow a little. Taking it long enough to separate myself from my biology. Hopefully resume ovulation and take supplements to support this. Clearly I'm going to need something in order to prevent vaginal atrophy. I've heard somewhere about being supplied with a small dose of E just to keep certain areas healthy?? \n\nYou can tell me if I'm wrong. I'm not that bright and still have plenty to learn. I just hope this text post can be free from any negative judgement, just for today, because right now I feel like sh*t. Right now I'm feeling like sh*t and honestly my head is in a dark place. Normally I can handle constructive criticism, but right now... it's really hard, I can't even concentrate on my studies right now. Honestly, I can't concentrate on anything. \n\nTaking hormones, being with the NHS... I'm so scared of things going terribly. I don't want to lose the chance of carrying a child, and I don't want to be denied hormones afterwards as I might not be able to handle any further dysphoria. \n\nYes, pregnancy. Most pregnancy is seen in females. Ha. My dad commented on this today. \"Pregnancy is a women's thing, why do you want to be pregnant!?\" \n\nEmbarrassing, I know. Yet I'm not going to share this with the entire planet, am I. I've heard of plenty of AFAB people going through pregnancy, if there's a slim chance I am able to still conceive than I would rather take it than throw it away because some stupid NHS regulations. Check boxes. Etc. \n\nI'm in the nonbinary form as although I'm in the process of starting male hormones, I don't feel entirely like a binary male.\n\nI hope someone can give me a little guidance... I seriously don't feel well... if you got anything horrid to say, tell me it later.. just not now.

They assume their understanding, and when I tell them no, that in fact they * can't* understand, they laugh and brush it off and remind me of my place.

They also both believe it is important for cis people to reject gender stereotypes as part of the overall goal of eliminating sexism and patriarchy.

I put zhe/zir because my hyper-active grammatical brain couldn\u2019t accept singular they. Seeing myself referred to as zhe/zir just felt right.

I also reject the idea that gender always exists in relation  (inclusive, alternating, etc. ) to these two concepts. \"Genderqueer\" seems like it has angles of making sense here too. \n\nI was assigned male and birth and have always felt like that made enough sense. I've never felt female and despite debilitating body image challenges, have always felt like having an external appearance labeled male was close enough. \n\nI\u2019m not feeling a need or interest in changing my body, etc. I'm in a relationship with another AMAB person for the past 20 years and usually identify as queer, but sometimes gay.\n\nBut in so many ways, I don\u2019t recognize myself as  \u201cmale.\u201d I don't feel connected to other men through a gender lens, don't feel at all like I am part of the conversation when people talk about men*, and have never been interested in gendered spaces or activities for men. I\u2019ve rarely felt men see me as one of them either. This includes gay/queer men as well.  I\u2019ve even noticed in my closest peer group that the \u201cmen\u201d connect with each other and are referred to as \u201cthe guys,\u201d etc. This never includes me. It\u2019s just understood that this is not me. \n\nAt this point \u2013 it\u2019s like I look male, I have male-male seeming romantic and sexual relationships, but I\u2019m otherwise not male internally. \n\nI remember bristling in childhood when a peer called me \"dude,\" couldn\u2019t understand why boys and girls had different clothes, shirts on or off when swimming, and frequently have to remind myself that I am male when people are speaking about men.

I have worn my hair long (for a boy/man) for nearly my entire life - not as a statement of my gender identity but because that's how I like my hair - and I was never really bothered when I was occasionally misgendered as a prepubescent/young teen. I would occasionally through middle and high school sketch myself as a girl, and sometimes used female avatars on forum websites. Even before I became more educated about gender and sexuality - and questioned my own - I always recognized that a part of me wanted to be more feminine (or something). \n\nWhen I got to college I was fortunate to have a very supportive social network that allowed me to experiment and I had a number of experiences that pushed me to question my sexuality and how I related to other people, discovering first that I am bisexual and then that I am polyamorous and - unsurprisingly - that I enjoy cross dressing, though not necessarily out of a sexual impulse but because I felt comfortable in clothes that are typically reserved for women. At every turn I felt comfortable and fulfillment in transgressing norms relating to gender and sex. \n\nI started reading about sex and gender through queer feminist theory and began to understand why I felt so claustrophobic in the masculine identity that had been pushed on me. I knew that I was not \"male\" but wasn't sure where that left me - agender, genderqueer, nonbinary, bigender - all of these felt more comfortable to me than being male, but where I fit exactly I wasn't quite sure. With no strong feelings one way or another I had a \"soft\" settle on being nonbinary. \n\nPresently I'm in a relationship with two wonderful partners, a woman that I'm engaged to whom I've been with for sixish years and an AFAB enby who has been part of our lives for the past year and a half. My interactions with my enby partner - as well as a few of my friends transitioning - has renewed my self reflection on my identity. Talking with them about their identity has made me feel more certain that I'm nonbinary, but as they have openly mused about transitioning to present more as such, I've been left uncertain of what to do. \n\nI guess ideally I would rather have a vagina though the idea of surgery is terrifying and something I prefer not to think about. In an ideal world I would have been born with one and would have come to my enby identity and would just take some T and change my dress to being more androgynous/butch. But that's not the world we live in. \n\nTransitioning feels so permanent and I'm not sure that I feel strongly enough about my gender identity and genitalia enough - in either way - to want to go through it. However, as I alluded to previously, I *really* dislike masculinity and the expectation that I perform it. \n\nObviously everyone's gender identity is their own so nobody can tell me what I should do per se. I'm just feeling a bit more dysphoric than normal at the moment and I just wanted to get that all off my chest a little. I would discuss this with my partners but since I don't really have anything productive that I want to do with these feelings and it's not really news to them... well, here I am.

I know that gender, masculinity, and femininity are all social constructs. *Traditionally* femininity is directly associated with females and masculinity is directly associated with males. My question is that since masculinity and femininity are constructs do they have a set definition now or are we adding on to them like we are to gender? Have they become descriptor words for peoples style, identity, etc? I feel like someone can still identify as feminine and present themselves more masculine, or can that not happen? For me, I want to present as both masculine and feminine (androgyny) and also feel like I identify as greybigender (I think..still figuring it out..not even entirely sure that is allowed sooo..?) so presenting as androgynous fits.

Fortunately, I've been going by a gender neutral nickname since I was 14. (I didn't accept my nonbinaryness until I was 23, so the fact that my nickname is gender neutral is a happy coincidence.) I use this nickname so commonly that I have dozens of friends who legitimately do not know what my legal first name is.\n\nFor most of the time I've had my Facebook, I've had my name set up as \"[First name] [Nickname] [Last name.]\" My family still calls me by my birth name, so this seemed like an easy way for both my friends and family to be able to find me. However, as time went on and I started going by my birth name less and less frequently, this started to bother me more and more, especially when Facebook would shorten it and refer to me by just my birth name rather than the full thing. I only use my birth name intentionally when I'm trying to be professional, (my nickname doesn't sound like a real name), so I've come to think of my nickname as who I really am and my birth name as more of a tool I use or an act I put on.\n\nAbout 10 months ago, I publicly came out as genderqueer, and this seemed like as good of an excuse as any to no longer have to deal with seeing my birth name on social media. Not only did I feel super disconnected from it anyway, but also the hyper femininity of it was really dysphoria triggering, so being able to use my personal Facebook account as \"[Nickname] [Last name]\" was incredibly freeing. I still had \"[First name] [Last name]\" in parenthesis on my profile, labeled as my birth name, in case family or anyone else who met me before age 14 wanted to find me, but having my nickname as my first name around the rest of Facebook was a massive weight off my chest.\n\n5 days ago, this all came crashing down. Facebook deactivated my account and demanded documentation to prove that [Nickname] [Last name] is in fact \"the name I use in every day life.\"\n\nThe problem is, Facebook has a list of all the types of documentation they'll accept, and pretty much all of it is either stuff that I don't have (magazine subscription, membership card, etc.) or stuff that has my birth name on it (driver's license, birth certificate, etc.) I have TONS of stuff I've accumulated over the years with my nickname on it, and I've tried submitting some of it, but since none of it is on their list, they won't accept it. I also tried sending a message explaining the situation, but all I got was an obviously copy/pasted reply that didn't address my concerns at all.\n\nI'm so fucking upset over this. More upset than I want to admit. I know it sounds dumb since it's just Facebook, but I've had that account since I was like 16 or 17 years old. I'm 26 now, so that's around a decade's worth of memories that I'm losing. I feel like someone confiscated my diary or scrapbook or something. Not to mention all of my friends whose phone numbers I don't have and Facebook is how we communicate, and I'm scared to death that I'm going to lose them. I'm also worried about my family hunting down my Twitter or Tumblr if they can't stalk me over Facebook, and I did NOT make those profiles safe for my family to look at.\n\nMy roommate is making matters worse too because she has the ability to help me fix it, but won't. We talked a few weeks ago about adding me to her CostCo account and getting me my own card, so I brought it up again knowing that I could probably have a CostCo card under my nickname and Facebook would probably accept it. However, not only does she completely not see my situation as a problem at all, but she also has severe social anxiety and wants to avoid big shopping centers like CostCo now that Christmas shopping season has started. I don't want to bring it up again and be that asshole who's dismissive of mental illness, especially over something that she doesn't even see as a problem, but I also am incredibly annoyed by the prospect of signing up for my own CostCo account because it seems so stupid to spend $60 basically just to get my Facebook profile back.\n\nPeople keep telling me to just put in the documentation for my legal name and switch back to my nickname as soon as my account is reactivated, but I'm scared that Facebook won't let me switch again without more documentation, and I'd rather be without Facebook for a short time than get my dysphoria triggered every time I log on. I know this isn't Facebook's intention, but the way they're trying to force my birth name on me feels like they're trying to force womanhood on me, so this entire ordeal has had dysphoria kicking my ass enough as it is. And it's SO DAMN FRUSTRATING because I did in fact have my legal name on my profile, so it wasn't like I was trying to be sneaky and conceal my identity or whatever. I just don't want that super feminine name to be the one I have to look at EVERY SINGLE SECOND I'm using my primary social network!\n\nSorry this was so long, but I've had too much anger and dysphoria in me for the last several days and needed to get it all out somewhere.

Recently I have wanted to be more androgynous, but idk if I just want to look more butch or if its a gender thing. \n\nI do also have some mental health issues, so that complicates things. Do I feel this way cause of mental illness, some weird form of depersonalization, or is it just who I am? I don't know, its confusing. I feel like it would be pointless for me to claim an identity when I don't intend to change my name or pronouns or my body, but it just feels like I don't connect to any gender sometimes. But maybe I am jest reading too much into it, or just confused, and I am just butch and cis? Its really confusing. \n\nSorry if I explained this poorly, I just had to get it off my chest.

My name is Kir, I use they/them. I'm Queer and Nonbinary, and have been/will probably always be on a path of self exploration. This is my first time posting here.\n\nI was wondering if my specific description of my gender experience will ring any bells regarding an existing identity or wordage for the mildly complex ideas within. I haven't quite found any labels that match up perfectly, on the quest as it were hehe.\n\nIf all of my gender experience was broken down into a grouping of three parts, one third would be masculine, one third feminine, and the remaining third would be empty. In other words, the Masculine &amp; Feminine can be identified as bigender/dualgender--but I feel as if I don't experience or am influenced by my gender as much I could potentially be as a human in (USA) culture. So there's this (maybe agender) bit, but calling that trigender feels like I'm identifying heavily with the empty space, when that space seems more to serve as an example in the fraction model.\nThen part of me wonders if the space is more of a gender neutral presence, I can't put a finger on it. The space in the 3/3 example feels both irrelevant BUT important to the equation (almost becoming a presence through its necessity.) \n\nMaybe I'm searching for a term that describes someone who experiences their gender in a small way. \nI feel like I'm playing and experimenting with it a lot (mentally and behaviorally, not just in expression.) My worldview is kinda like, I feel like a genderless soul in a cool flesh suit, and with that soul being filtered through an animal brain with chemicals the gender more or less is either developed, or heightened from a base personality concept.\n\nAny thoughts on the matter are super appreciated.

I didn't really think about it much after noticing that, though, and never mentioned it to anybody.\n\nWhen I was 19, I spent some time trying to figure out what people meant when they talked about \"just knowing\" they were whatever gender. There were no neon arrows in my brain saying \"this gender feels right and all others feel wrong\" or whatever. I decided I was probably agender or something. I didn't come out to anybody, and I only thought about it on and off.\n\nI'm 20 now. At the beginning of October I got a binder on a whim and wearing it felt really right. This made me wonder whether it was a gender thing. I'd strongly found myself relating to a few fictional trans men recently, which hadn't felt significant before but seemed kind of like it might be now. So I spent a lot of time online trying to figure out what felt right. I found myself posting on r/ftm (on a different throwaway), mentioning my experience, and desperately hoping they would tell me I was a trans guy. Which, you know, seemed like another pretty solid piece of evidence that I was a trans guy. So I went to the mall and got some men's clothes and I love love loved the way they looked on me and fit me in the binder. So I spent most of October and early November thinking of myself as a guy, with a new male name and he/him pronouns. It was really easy to make the switch, although there were some things I didn't like (not wearing nail polish or short shorts). Anyways, I came out as trans to my parents and best friend in early November, with a plan to go on hormones in January. My best friend was super great about it and my parents were less thrilled, but also it was clear that they'd eventually be accepting.\n\nAfter coming out, I felt like I had made a huge mistake and permanently ruined my life. I wanted to go back to female name and pronouns. So I un-came out a few days after I came out. I figured that I was actually a butch woman; I still liked men's clothes and binding, but I'd misunderstood the reasons for those. I went back to thinking of myself with my old female name and she/her pronouns, and it was just as easy to make the switch as it had been before. And it felt really good to re-add some feminine things into my life. I saw my family for thanksgiving and I felt good being one of the women.\n\nI felt happy and settled in my identity for a couple weeks or so after that. I've been really enjoying pairing men's clothes with nail polish, lipstick, and earrings. That combo is basically what I've been wearing every day for the past three-ish weeks, and it's felt very good.\n\nBut... for the past week or so I've been feeling like something's off. The idea that I am a cis girl, that that's who I am and probably who I've always been, makes me unhappy. It's like... I wish I was a trans guy. I've seen in a few places wisdom like \"cis people don't wish they're trans\" and \"if you've spent a ton of time questioning, that's a good sign that you're not cis.\" Which makes sense. But also I'm pretty sure trans people don't immediately regret coming out as trans despite a lack of negative reactions, feel relief at reversing the coming out, and feel happy being seen by family as their birth gender. So I'm not entirely sure where that leaves me, but the nonbinary subreddit seemed like a good next step.\n\nHere are some options that I'm considering\n1) I'm a cis girl who strongly relates of the narratives of trans men due to internalized misogyny preventing me from relating to women. I really loved the idea of being a trans man because all of the clothing changes I had made so far had made me feel happier and this seemed like proof that being trans would make me happier. When I came out, it was the first time I faced real consequences instead of this being a fantasy, and that's why it felt wrong. \n2) I'm a trans guy who was moving too fast with coming out so soon after figuring out my identity. I got scared by making so many rapid changes, and I was afraid that coming out as trans would mean I lost or changed my relationships with my friends and family. I've gone back into denial and moved into my comfort zone.\n3) I'm agender. I've been mistaking liking various societally-gendered things as identifying with the binary genders themselves, and I lack an actual internal gender. I liked the idea of being a trans guy because it seemed like it would provide me with a certainty about gender that I'd never felt before, but actually stating an allegiance to one gender over another felt wrong because I didn't actually have an internal sense of gender.\n4) I'm bigender and/or genderfluid. The reason I'm having so much trouble pinning down my gender identity is because it's actually different at various moments in time. I was feeling particularly male in October, but coming out as a guy felt wrong because I also have a female side.\n\nThey/them pronouns don't feel right (they're actually worse than both she/her and he/him, I think?) and I'm not particularly drawn to attempting to be androgynous, so that's one thing ruled out at least.\n\nI want to keep using she/her pronouns and my feminine name, at least for the most part. I plan to do that and continue dressing for the most part in masculine clothes and feminine accessories. It seems like if I know how I want to outwardly present my gender, I don't need to actually identify the internal feelings behind it... but thinking of myself as a girl still feels wrong, and I get this bad sinking feeling in my chest when I think about gender, and it really bothers me that there's this part of myself that's a mystery. It's like a bruise; I know that poking at my gender to figure out what's going well is just going to result in more turmoil, but I can't stop doing it until there's a point where I can think about my gender without this much turmoil.\n\nI guess what I'm asking is... how do I figure out what my gender actually is? A lot of advice suggests figuring out your desired gender presentation (what clothes you want to wear, etc) but I'm feeling pretty good about that; my issue's more of figuring out which gender my outward presentation is linked to. All four options I mentioned above seem extremely likely, even though they're also all contradictory, and arbitrarily picking one doesn't feel like a great way to do this.\n\n", "date": "2017-12-04 08:17:01", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7hg0x8/questioning/", "author": "throwaway290832098"}, {"title": "Weekly Off-Topic Discussion post", "text": "Sorry I'm late I'm having the worst dysphoria and just freaking the fuck out/wanting to die.

Straight as an arrow, in fact. Always been, most likely always will. \nI grew up in a very conservative and traditional family, which means that I had a very binary approach to gender, sex, and whatnot. To me the world was very simple - either you are male, or female, gay, or bi. That's all - four options, anything more than that is unnecessary.\n\nAs a straight male, I like females. Period. No question. Simple. I also technically like lesbians or bi females, as my survival instinct still tells me that their bodies allow reproduction, thus I feel sexual attraction.\n\nThis being said, I have been recently challenged by individuals who clearly have issues with this restrictive system - and invited me to open my mind and realise that there are lots of people who simply do not fit into these simplistic categories. \n\nNote that this is a VERY recent thing. I am still bound (\"shackled\", as some might say) by my beloved binary world, and letting go is stupidly hard. \n\nNow, this would just be an academic exercise anyway - as I am still a cisgender straight white male, brought up in a wealthy western family. The epitome of privilege, some may think. It is just a matter of looking at this new, complex system - and accept it for what it is - accept that a lot of individuals feel the need to broaden this shallow binary system. Easy, as long as it does not involve you or challenges your own identity.\n\nHowever, recent circumstances led me to enter a relationship with a girl, who defines herself as agender. Note that I am using female pronouns here, because I don't know what else to use and, frankly, using anything else makes me even more uncomfortable so I avoid it for my own sanity.\n\nNow, this may be nothing to you - but you must understand that to me this is a big deal. A huge one. \n\nI define myself as straight. I am attracted to females and the thought of physical contact with a man (unless it is a manly fistfight) makes me nauseous. I am not exaggerating. \n\nI am now faced with a terrible question.\n\nAm I still straight? Would being in a relationship with someone who is agender (but of female sex, obviously) make me something else? \nDoes being attracted to a female body override the being in a relationship with a non-female-identified person? I would say yes, as if I had in front of me a very attractive female sentient android I would probably still want a relationship with it even if technically agender, but here we are talking about other humans, not things. As I said above I am also still attracted to the female body regardless of the gender identity of the person that inhabits it (lesbians), but a relationship with them could never actually happen. Also, as far as I understand, sexual orientation and gender identity are separate anyway, so....I am confused. What am I attracted to and where does that put me in this new complex system that may be too convoluted for me?\n\nAgain, I understand that all of this may sound close-minder and whatnot. But please try to understand my situation. It is not easy for me.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nThank you.\n\n\n", "date": "2017-12-06 10:21:13", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7hx675/relationship_with_an_agender_individual/", "author": "LunarDial00"}, {"title": "People who wear non-binary pride gear in public, ever meet other enbies because of it?", "text": "I'm thinking of knitting a non-binary pride scarf soon, and I have a few other random pride items lying around, and I've wondered if I just wore that stuff around all the time, if maybe other enbies would notice me and come up and talk to me.

I've tried therapy, but it hasn't helped. Worried.", "text": "This turned into quite the rant, sorry.\n\nFor quite some time now I've identified as agender, but the reason is making me question if that's really who I am. I've tried to dissect my feelings, and this is the conclusion at which I've arrived:\n\nI find sex revolting and traumatic; thinking about it too long (more than a few seconds in a not-vague/abstract form) turns into a panic attack, and libido/arousal feels disgusting. Gender is often linked with sex (not to say that sexuality correlates with gender, per se, but certain stereotypes are sexualized and I haven't seen agender people sexualized nearly as much as gender-identifying people). Because I want to get away from anything to do with sex, I want to separate myself from gender. At some point I'd like to have surgery to remove my genitals without replacing them with the binary alternative; and if at all possible, at the same time remove any libido or sex drive.\n\nDuring the time I was on HRT and actively anorexic (right now I'm eating more but it's a struggle, I want to \"relapse\" and I can't entirely convince myself that would be a bad thing), my hormone levels were extremely low (just above male range estrogen, low female range for testosterone). This made me very happy, and I suspect (I need to make an appointment for follow-up blood work) that my estrogen levels have been increasing as I eat more (my libido is coming back, for one).\n\nI'd love to have both sex hormones reduced to 0 or near 0, but I haven't been able to find anything on Google regarding low sex hormones aside from \"reduced libido\" (very desirable) and bone density loss (not so desirable); safety is a concern, but I haven't been able to find any resources regarding anything I could take that would prevent bone density loss aside from increasing one sex hormone or the other.\n\nIf absolutely necessary, I will allow my estrogen levels to increase, though I despise the idea of feminization. I'd like to avoid that outcome if at all possible.\n\nThat's not to say I'm aromantic; but the form of romance I would want might not be a healthy one\u2014I just want someone to rely on to make me feel safe and valid, and while I would reciprocate as much as possible, I don't know how much I really have to offer; on the other hand, I would also want someone who would rely on me in the same way\u2014but not the same person (and I would be happy to be in a 3-person relationship, though at the same time can't help feel that it's wrong\u2014all my life I've been taught that \"civilized people are monogamous\" and I guess that's really stuck with me).\n\nI've spoken to a therapist about this stuff, but only in fairly vague terms; I don't feel comfortable bringing up stuff from my past without anonymity, and the thought that there might be consequences for certain people if the therapist felt the need to take action is concerning.\n\nTL;DR: I'm worried that trauma might be steering me away from binary transgender feelings (MtF) and \"making\" me agender; and from what I've been able to piece together from introspection, this seems probable.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I'm unsure if I should just \"get over it\" (the therapist's advice, the same as with anorexia) and let my estrogen increase and hope I can overcome this at some point in the future, or if I should let these feelings be valid, not question them, and do what makes me comfortable right now. (I don't want anyone to get the wrong impression, I don't think the therapist is transphobic or unsupportive; she just sees the distress I'm in about this and I guess doesn't know what else to say.)", "date": "2017-12-07 07:32:35", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7i4u57/i_cant_help_but_feel_like_this_makes_my_identity/", "author": "QuietSpontaneity"}, {"title": "Questioning?", "text": "Hello, I'm posting this because I haven't found something similar to my problem.

I'm new to this topic as a whole so bear with me here, but I've been doing a ton of research on the thing and I think I'm either non binary or gender queer AND androgyne (maybe bigender or something else entirely, I don't know). I feel like I am both male and female. I don't have a need to switch between the two, nor do I feel more like a boy or more like a girl. They are both equal in the amount that I feel they are there, but this has nothing to do with feeling more masculine or feminine for me. The boy part of me is on the inside (let me get poetic here), being my soul, my mind, my imagination. The girl part of me is my personality and natural outward appearance, so I bring out the boy part of me from the inside by cross dressing and putting my hair in low ponytails. I feel masculine sometimes and feminine at other times because of the fact that I feel like both. So, my question is... What should I label myself as?

And we pretty much ruled out being transsexual since i dont have the signs of one and i knew that already but we have yet to find out what deep reason causes these feelings. Luckily he understands the importance of the matter and is talking with some known surgeons in Thailand that would be able to do this surgery for my specific case.\n\nAnyway here's my experience, i think the first sign there was something different with me when probably in early puberty where the mere thought of my sticking my penis anywhere was repulsive and utterly wrong, it just didnt fit \"me\" to do anything like that so i started thinking myself as a kind of exclusive bottom gay guy.\n\nThen i remember i first stumbled upon a guy who had mtf surgery and lived as a man on the internet and everything just felt fitting for me to be something like that, as in it made sense and i remember researching a lot about it because it felt like something i should do, i didnt have many strong feelings about it like i do now but i did feel i should do that in the future. Sadly the more time i spent researching the more i found out people saying that there was no way to get this surgery done outside of back alley surgeons and you had to pretend to be an mtf transgender to get it done which needed a year of female hormones. And since i didnt have the resources and was pretty disappointed i kinda put that plan on the backburner consciously.\nToo bad my mind apparently wasnt satisfied with that because after some time i started having trans thoughts, that they would often focus on having a vagina and even though i just didnt like the idea of being a woman i tried to say that it was some kind of internalized misogyny because these feelings wouldnt stop, but after some time i realized that i simply didnt like the idea of being a woman in my every day life, not even once and it wasnt any internalized misogyny causing this, it was just me not fitting with that image. That caused me a great deal of confusion and similar repeating trans thoughts that only disappeared once i started thinking about being a man with female genitals more seriously instead of just something silly i wanted to do, and only then did everything just make sense and all forms of trans thoughts disappeared. \nOnly after accepting that i felt a lot more secure about me in general and who i am, because everything just fitted perfectly though my feelings about wanting to get this operation done are a lot stronger about it. And i dont see this as a very sexual thing, it is more of a feeling that i need to have that genitals and live my life like that since i dont intend to be having that much sex since im not a very slutty person in general lul\nAnd even though i consider myself to be a practical person i feel the impracticality of the surgery testosterone injections/dilation etc are definitely worth the trouble\n", "date": "2017-12-08 12:00:52", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7iej9k/men_who_want_to_have_the_opposite_genders_genitals/", "author": "Ralph2449"}, {"title": "I\u2019m going crazy cooped up in my mind", "text": "I know I belong here somehow.

It was a big stressor for me, to be quite honest. I had talked about going by Saige with my girlfriend and we both liked it a bit. But then I realized that if my first name was Saige, that means my first/last name would be Saige Frances. (Frances is my legal middle name, but I have good feelings connected to it, so I decided I wanted it to be my last name.) The problem with Saige Frances is that a spoken word/hip hop artist that I like is called that (spelled differently though). Soooo.... yeah. Awkward. No way. I kept thinking of other names that I could use, but nothing ever felt like it fit. So I went with a fairly gender neutral name that I loved the sound of. Avery. It started off as a \"boy's\" name, but is also used as a \"girl's\" now too.  Plus, it came from French, but is related to the Old English words aelf, meaning elf, and raed, meaning counsel. Which turns into Ruler of the Elves. And I mean, come on, how fucking rad is that?? So now I go by Avery Saige Frances. I love the sound of it SO much.

When we got to the discussion of trans issues, my grandma said that she\u2019s always felt like a woman \u2013 and asked if I did, too. Well, she was more like, \u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d meaning she expected a yes. It was rhetorical, because I\u2019m into traditionally feminine things. I love makeup, I love dresses, and I presented as femme pretty often.\n\nMy response was unexpected \u2013 like, so unexpected that I didn\u2019t even see it coming. \u201cUh, yeah, I mean mostly.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s obviously confused. I\u2019m like, \u201coh shit.\u201d She tells me to talk to my therapist, I say it doesn\u2019t bother me, and I go to think about it.\n\nIt\u2019s been a while since that discussion. I think it\u2019s been a year? Maybe? I have no concept of time. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been thinking about it nonstop. I remember being fifteen \u2013 four years ago \u2013 maybe even younger and thinking about how cool it would be to have a binder.

I think about a lot of things.\n\nAnd then comes the dreaded Imposter Syndrome Thoughts.\nHere\u2019s the big problem I\u2019m facing. I feel like I don\u2019t have enough dysphoria. I understand that not everyone has it, and I really don\u2019t care whether someone lacks it because it\u2019s not my business. But here I am. I absolutely don\u2019t have any bottom dysphoria \u2013 genitals just really don\u2019t bother me. I don\u2019t even really think about them. But there are times where I have some Rough top dysphoria. It\u2019s just so rare, though. I really hate it when others point out my chest, and I hate calling them breasts to the point where I didn\u2019t even like typing that. But I can point them out fine? Most of the time? And I don\u2019t really care if someone refers to me by she/her pronouns. I\u2019d prefer they/them but I don\u2019t get dysphoria from it.\n\nI\u2019m just really confused. There\u2019s not a day that goes by without me thinking of what the fuck is going on, and it\u2019s been like that for a while now. I keep thinking about coming out, but then I\u2019m scared I\u2019m just faking. I can\u2019t wait for the day that I can get a binder, just so I can go as masc when I feel like it, but what if I\u2019m just butch?\n\nEven writing this I\u2019m confused. I think I\u2019m NB.

I don't believe in gender as an intrinsic quality, I believe that it is a cultural one, shaped by social expectations and various experiences. \n\n\nGender is to my mind entirely seperate from sex (other than the ways in which it is culturally percieved to be connected) and that Gender *IS* Gender Presentation (in how one presents themselves to themselves), it isn't a choice persay (because your perception of it is cultivated by things outside of your control), but is socially constructed rather than somehow intrinsic (coming from genetics or some kind of a-priori soul), which to me is fine because identity studies is very important to me, i don't think it has to be intrinsic to be valid, so many valid and important human experiences are constructed in that way. \n\nTo me, neither man nor woman captures what I am, i feel as if I have traits of both (and that this is true of most people) in a way that makes me feel uncomfortable identifying as either gender. I find myself often splitting my avatars in games and the like with a 50-50 balance, or deciding on them based entirely off other aesthetic concerns (lack of a slender male body type virtually guarantees i'll select a female character, for instance). \n\n\nI do idealize a world where Gender isn't as meaningful as it is today, more like a personality question, and that comes to me from another part of me which is very important: my feminism, I resent gender roles and a lot of the baggage that comes with it when you describe yourself using a gender and think that no one really fits into these categories as they're understood. For a little while, after meeting some non-binary people I identified as such, viewing my own identity as a rejection of gender as it's understood in society, a sort of gender-atheism, but then stopped because I didn't feel secure doing so when i realized some people seem to view their non-binary identity as it's own category on a list of possible genders. Like \"are you a Man? Woman? Non-Binary?\" almost like it's just become another option in the binary. i respect their identities as a valid experience, but I don't think seeing gender as intrinsic in that way is right to me.\n\nIs there a different word for the identity of someone who rejects gender as an intrinsic category?

I can also say that buying my first pair was a big step and that I ran into a lot of problems I could not really find an answer for. I hope that, by sharing my experiences here, some people who are looking to buy breastforms can get a better idea of the issues they might run into and what they have to look out for. \n\nIt has been a few years now since I bought my first pair of breast forms. I live in a small-ish country in Europe, where Amazon or eBay don\u2019t really exist. Buying breast forms therefore, was easier said than done. Most of the breast forms I found on the internet, were the full-on medical-grade prosthetics. Being a student, they were way out of my league price-wise. After an extensive search, I found a fetish shop that sold breast forms as well. They had a little web shop, so I could have ordered them online, but I had no idea which size I had to buy and, since they were still over 100 euros, I decided to be bold and go visit the brick and mortar fetish shop, so I could compare sizes and decide if I thought they were worth the money. They were. [Lo and behold (NSFW)](http://imgur.com/9oagsyP)\n[From a different angle, still NSFW](http://imgur.com/LfPvuLw)\n\nProbably because of the feeling that I had to overcompensate for the masculinity of the rest of my body, I went a bit overboard with the size. I bought E-cup breast forms and even though I have pretty broad shoulders, they were on the large side. I wasn\u2019t too bothered by that though. I was never going to go outside and the bigger size meant they were softer and bouncier than a smaller size would have been; not a bad thing, in my experience. \n\n**My first bra**\nBut, of course, breast forms are pointless if you have nothing to hold them in the place where actual breasts would preferably go. I had a low-impact sports bra at the time, which wasn\u2019t really up to the job of holding 1200 grams of silicone in place. I decided to go online and buy myself a bra. I knew a full cup bra would be the way to go, so that my breast forms wouldn\u2019t fall out of the top of my bra if I leant forwards, and decided to go for a padded T-shirt bra. This however, caused some issues. I measured my ribcage and decided that I would need a 90E bra. The circumference turned out to be spot on: it was tight, but definitely not uncomfortably so, at the most outwards set of hooks. It was the cups that did not agree with my breast forms. Even though the number in a bra size represents the circumference of your ribcage, and not the width of your breast, people with a larger circumference, will most likely have wider breasts. The cups of a 90E bra therefore, are quite wide. Breast forms, on the other hand, are measured in projection size only (perhaps this is not the case for the medical-grade ones, but the cheaper ones come in projection sizes only). This means I did not buy 90E breastforms, but E-size breastforms. As it turns out, my breast forms were way too narrow [for the cups of a 90E bra](http://imgur.com/An67Sgl)\n\nAnother issue with breast forms and a padded bra is that, even though breast forms are quite squishy, they are not as malleable as natural breasts. This wouldn\u2019t be too much of a problem, were it not that the curve of the cups of my bra was completely different [than the curve of my breast forms](http://imgur.com/SuoIKet)\n\nMy breast forms had to sit quite high up in my bra therefore, making them spill over the top even in a full cup bra. \n\n**My second bra**\nSince cups of my first bra were way too wide, and since the shape didn\u2019t work either, I decided to go for a non-padded, wireless sports bra as my second bra. This bra had no cups that could be too narrow or the wrong shape, so it seemed perfect. And it was. At first. The problem with a bra with no cups however, is the uniboob effect: everything gets squished to the middle, were it becomes one big, unrecognizable mass. This problem is way worse if your breasts are connected in no way, shape or form, which is why this plan did not really work either. \n\n**My third bra**\nThe third bra I bought, was a bra with underwires and non-padded, full-coverage cups. I bought it in a 90D because I measured myself and was actually somewhere in between an E and a D. This bra turned out to be spot on. It hold everything in place wonderfully, was reasonably comfortable and worked with the shape of my breast forms. I am quite pleased with how they [turned](http://imgur.com/4YnfJXV) out to [look](http://imgur.com/WFgOy92) with the right bra. \n\n**From here**\nWhat is lacking still, is a way to sleep with breast forms. It happens quite often that I don\u2019t want to take off my breasts at the end of the day. Sleeping with an underwired bra however, is far from ideal, so I\u2019m still looking for a way to make that work. \n\n**ps**\nOne additional problem with boobs that aren't attached: you can end up sitting on one and cause [this](http://imgur.com/2qhEefs). \n\n**pps**\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me!\n", "date": "2017-12-14 18:42:01", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7jtmz2/my_personal_experiences_with_buying_breastforms/", "author": "Laura1004"}, {"title": "I am fine with men and women existing", "text": "As long as they don't act all gendered in public.

A reason, why I'm not 100% sure about calling myself NB. The goal is to appear feminine, because most male stuff makes me bored/sad/angry, female stuff instead makes me happy.\n\nThe point why I struggle to call myself trans-femme is because if there wouldn't be a gender labeling the female stuff, I'd be just someone who wants some kind of clothes/styling/haircuts and has some kind of body.

I'm also fond of biker type leather jackets, recently found a silver one that is cropped pretty high though and not sure how to wear thing cropped to my natural waist. Trench coat, \n\n\nSweaters- mostly cardigans and some with wider necklines or some drape to them mostly in neutral colors, black, brown, one in maroon.\n\n\nShirts- a couple simple floral button up shirts in softer thinner fabrics, a couple striped long sleeve nautical type shirts with stripes, a couple tees with wider neck lines and shorter sleeves also falling just below the waist just above the hip with slight flare. Flannel shirts mostly oversized\n\n\nPants/jeans- work pants that are kinda boxy and loose, skinny jeans that come to the waist in black, grey and dark and light blue, a couple pairs of boot cut/flared jeans, some cropped pants. Cargo pants, I want to try to find Collettes ( I think that's what I mean,  the looser cropped pants) I also have some leggings but they are mostly worn at home and not out \n\n\nShoes ( probably the category that is the most all over the place) I have several pairs of converse all stars, some vans slip ons and high tops, doc marten derbies , black combat boots, cowboy boots in brown, some 1.5 inch side zips boots in black suede, black Chelsea boots also some random nikes like air force ones.\n\nSo this is kind of some of the things I am working with. I struggle a lot with footwear.

I feel for sure that if I was only into women, I would be a nonbinary butch lesbian, and if I was only into men, I would be a nonbinary gay trans guy, but because I'm bi I feel like I'm somehow both.

You're averse to anything feminine, looking in the men's section, and Mom thinks you're transitioning.\"\nI tried to tell her no, but she didn't believe me. She kept trying to get me to admit I was trans/transitioning. \nNormally I fluctuate a lot more, but being home with my family, I feel they're pushing me to express femininely. Which means I've been more MOC lately. \nHow do I get my family off my back?\nTLDR: Family thinks I'm transitioning because I'm MOC nonbinary. How can I convince them I'm not?", "date": "2017-12-29 22:08:51", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7mxfd3/family_thinks_im_transitioning_but_im_not_long/", "author": "unicornenby8015"}, {"title": "When to mention my gender after coming out letter?", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-12-29 22:10:05", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7mxfli/when_to_mention_my_gender_after_coming_out_letter/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Help?

This means doctors (for a lot more than just transitioning - life-threatening allergies, progressive hearing loss, a couple of other fairly minor things). \n\nBefore I talk to the doc about being trans/NB, I want to arm myself with ALL the information, and y'all seem to know what's what!\n\nI'm hoping to talk to the doc about hormone therapy - not as far as T, but like an estrogen blocker that would mimic menopause or something. Google is generous with info about AMAB antiandrogens, and full AFAB HRT but pretty limited with the info I'm looking for (could be my region tho).\n\nLikewise if someone has any experience with this under the Ontario healthcare system, any intel is much appreciated. \n\n&lt;3 happy new year everyone!\n", "date": "2017-12-30 12:31:08", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7n1bxu/ny_resolutions_transitioning_doctors/", "author": "stickbeat"}, {"title": "I finally had top surgery and honestly I feel so good it makes me cry lol", "text": "", "date": "2017-12-31 07:00:41", "subreddit": "NonBinary", "permalink": "/r/NonBinary/comments/7n76an/i_finally_had_top_surgery_and_honestly_i_feel_so/", "author": "devtie"}, {"title": "Happy New Year!
