Apparently, something similar like this happened in the 90s, with gay becoming a trend, and straight people pretending to be gay so they could get attention. Once they realized that what they were doing was stupid, they didn't just stop and leave the LGBT community alone. Most of them became anti gay rights activists. They're a big part of the reason why homophobia was, and in some places in the US, like where I live, is still, a big epidemic. I think something similar will happen when these transtrenders come to their senses. I'm pretty sure most of them will become anti trans activists, because they think that what crap THEY were doing is what an actual trans person does. If it gets bad enough, transphobia could become the new homophobia. I'm pretty sure these transtrenders will completely destroy all progress that trans people made to be considered equal. Trans suicide rates will be through the roof. They already are, but it's just gonna get worse. Believe it or not, gay people were actually making a lot of progress in the 70s, and \n1940s Germany used to be a pretty accepting place for gay people until Hitler came to power and y'know... all that HOLOCAUST STUFF. Gay people were making lots of progress. But something came to destroy it completely. I think that's what is about to happen to us trans people. The sad part is, the damage has already been done, and there's nothing we can do about it now. I'm a trans youth that discovered I was trans right when it was kind of starting to be accepted. I then watched it become a trend as I was brainwashed into the mass of SJWs. I eventually came to my senses, and now I'm seeing trans people become more and more hated because of these transtrenders ruining our reputation. Once transtrenders come to their senses, which will be pretty soon since some of them are going on hormones, and once they regret it they'll all start crying to their youtube subscribers, everything will hit the fan at once for trans people. It appalls me that we let these people do this to the LGBT community. I used to be hopeful that things would get better. Now I know things can only get worse.", "date": "2017-05-01 22:27:12", "subreddit": "truscum", "permalink": "/r/truscum/comments/68p87z/do_you_think_this_will_all_blow_over/", "author": "Raging_Ross"}, {"title": "Is the term truscum offensive?", "text": "I read that the origin of this term comes from certain Tumblr communities that intended for the term to be rude and insulting.
