If you've gone the low dose hormones route, did you have any side effects that you didn't expect or didn't like? Any thoughts are appreciated.

I apparently don't act like the gender I came out as, so he's not going to refer to me as a man.

At the third, I didn't speak to him, but stayed where I wanted and conversed with other family whether he was there or not.  It wasn't to snub him, but I have 0 will to even be polite to him.  At the end of the gathering, he approached me and tried to say goodbye and give me a hug.\n\nI said, \"No, don't, I'm serious\" and he kept trying to hug me.  I raised my voice (out of panic basically) and said \"Don't touch me!\" and he left, embarrassed.  He's been ranting and whining about how he doesn't discriminate, how he accepts his family, etc, since then a *week ago*.

Sorry for the rant, I'm really worked up right now!  I guess this post is to ask, am I wrong about this?  I didn't make anyone else uncomfortable, I had talked to everyone before I went to make sure they were okay with my presence and the conflict that could occur if he tried to pretend nothing was wrong.  If it would be awkward or uncomfortable, I wouldn't have gone.

I'm too nervous to post in any bigger subreddit, so I was hoping I could reach at least a few people here so I could just connect with some of you who understand what I'm going through.\n\nFor the past 18 years (my whole life) I've been living as a guy and for the past 4 years I've been thinking about suicide on a regular basis. I can't remember exactly when all of these feelings really started, but somewhere down the line I realized I wanted to be different. Well, I didn't realize it until high school, but the signs were there. I would dress like a girl when my parents weren't home, I would try on makeup, I would pretend to be a girl online - I did all kinds of things to make myself happy when not much else did. I'm currently living on campus as a first-year university student and I have no idea what to do with my life. I feel a suffocating pressure to come out of the closet before I waste away more of my life, but I have no way of knowing how that will go. My father had told me in the past that he thinks transgender people are \"circus freaks\". How can I possibly face him, or my grandparents, or my friends and tell them this? It's terrifying to even imagine it.\n\nI've considered doing other things like shopping online for clothes that I can wear in private, but even that won't work. I have a roommate sharing this tiny dorm room with me who has no idea that I'm trans. On top of that, I don't have the money to afford clothes on top of school.\n\nI know deep down that the only solution to these problems are to bite the bullet and come out, but it's so hard. It's too hard... I can't stop thinking about my dad's face when he hears about this, or how my brother would react. I can't stop thinking about dedicating so much time and effort into passing as a woman only to have it all fail because of a voice that's too deep or a body that's too masculine. And no matter how many times I tell myself that this is natural and normal, I can't help but see myself as some kind of mistake.\n\nThere's so many things that I have to worry about, and life isn't slowing down to let me think through my options with a clear mind. It's so depressing and demoralizing. I've been very depressed recently and I don't really know what I'm looking for with this post... Feeling this way can be very isolating. I feel alone despite having a few cis friends who accept me for who I am. I think about suicide almost every day now, but I don't want to die. I really don't want to die... But right now I'm afraid of living and I'm worried that I'll never be happy in my own skin. I'm worried that I'll never get to be myself. I'm worried that more and more time will pass until I get to the point where my youth is completely spent. I'm scared. \n\nIt's 11:30 PM, I'm crying in bed, and I'm worried that I won't be able to keep this up much longer. Thank you for listening to me, that's really all I've ever wanted.

I don't mean to sound transphobic either, as I have had other trans friends, and I understand that even scientifically, their struggles and the way they are is legitimate and valid. For some reason it's hard to accept myself, and it may be based mostly on this fear.

So..without going into too much detail, I was given the green light to start testosterone last Wednesday, but when I showed up for my appointment, I was informed I would not be getting my prescription because of my congenital heart murmur. \n\n-I've never been put on any restrictions by my cardiologist.\n\n-I've never passed out etc because of my heart murmur.\n\n-I asked my cardiologist specifically if there would be any conflict with starting hrt and I was given the green light.\n\nWhen I began going to the doctor at the LGBT center in my area, he asked about my heart murmur. I explained the three points I just listed above. The doctor asked me to sign a release of records form to be faxed over to my cardiologist and for a letter to be faxed over giving me permission to start hrt. I complied and and my cardiologist sent the letter. When I showed up, the doctor sat me down and read the part of the letter that bothered him. Pretty much it said he didn't see anything wrong with me starting T, but he was not aware of any research of patients with heart murmurs starting hrt. In other words, he covered his own ass so he couldn't get sued if  something went wrong. Duh. The doctor had a problem with that because he said that puts all the blame on him if something goes wrong. Now I'm in the middle of this uphill battle where he's getting in contact with my second cardiologist to see if he can get a letter that doesn't absolve the cardiologist of any blame. (Ya. Fat chance. They're not the ones prescribing the T. It's not going to be worded like that.) He has also told me that he will only start me on gel and we'll be going as slow as possible. I understand the reasoning, but I'm not satisfied with that answer. I don't want to go at a snail's pace. I've waited long enough for this and there is no conflict with T and this heart murmur. \n\nDoes anyone else have experience getting T with a congenital heart murmur? What dosage were you started on and did anything tragic happen? I need examples so that if I have to argue my way into a prescription I have some facts to go on.

Suddenly almost everything about myself made sense. Since then I've slowly started to explore that part of myself and I'm certain, more certain than about anything else in my life, that I want to transition.\n\nBut here's the problem. In order to know for sure if I have a dissociative disorder I'll have to discuss it with my doctor. I've mentioned a couple of times to her that I want to transition but she never asks me about it. I'm worried that if I ask her about dissociative disorders it will invalidate, in her mind, the dysphoria I'm feeling and it will ultimately stall the process of transitioning. What's making me even more worried is that this might turn out just like every other time I've thought I'd figured out what was wrong with me and not only would I be stalling the process but now she'd question everything else I told her because I was wrong about this.\n\nReddit has helped me a lot in the past (this is a new account, I forgot my old username and password because I didn't visit for a while) and I'm pretty much at a loss for who else to turn to.

We laugh. We gel very well. He grounds me and I push him. In other words we are normally a very stable couple. \n\nBut we are not birds of a feather. We disagree on music, movies and even food. I'm a very touchy feely person, he has loads of touch sensitivity so that's awkward at best. Sex is very occasional. He's not tidy and I tend to be.  On and on. For us opposites do attract.

When I was younger, and through highschool transitioning was never a legitimate possibility in my mind but I always knew something was off, especially during puberty.  The changes to my body caught me very off guard and I was particularly sensitive about my height (Ive always been the tallest in my classes and have been about 6'4\" since I was 15).  Much to my chagrin, my height seems to be my defining characteristic and for this and other reasons I wouldn't admit (even to myself) what the cause of my drastic mood swings that eventually led to a brief stint in a mental hospital.  I kept insisting that \"my brain wasn't balanced\" and tried to place my faith in western antipsychotics.  Years of these turned out to not be the solution I was looking for and I weened myself off by the time I was about 21.  \n\n\nI think it may have been my experimentation with psychedelics that showed me a different framework that was always there but deeply buried and Ive gradually been coming to terms with the fact that I am at least not a male in the traditional sense.  For 5 years I've gone through many periods of buying women's clothing and makeup and trying to explore this other side of myself only to bury it all back in the closet when the realization that a transition just doesn't seem logistically feasible and I would probably end up drawing a lot of negative attention to myself that I am not sure if I would be able to handle (I am very shy and usually like to keep a low profile).\n\n\nI am scared about what I know about myself now because I feel simultaneously more liberated and more trapped than I have ever felt before.\n\n\nFor fear of a wall of text, Ive only provided a basic outline but would love to elaborate.

Whenever I think about seeing myself as a woman, something relaxes inside of me. The first time it was like a headache I didn't even notice I had all my life until it lifted. It was a euphoric feeling. A similar feeling I get out of choosing to play as a woman in a video game (Something I've found I've done all my life)\n\nAll this said though, I find the idea of transitioning from my outwardly male life to an outwardly female life terrifying. I'm at peace with the idea of living the way I am for the rest of my life without making any major changes. I don't feel the need to pass as a woman to others as much as I feel the need to pass as a woman to myself. I can never work out if that makes me truly trans or just a man living a comforting fantasy of being a woman.\n\nThat's the most disturbing part for me. I don't know what I am. I guess what I'm really asking here is, do my experiences ring true for anyone else...And can a person be trans but choose not to live an outwardly trans life.

Today I decided to go back through all of my old journals, because I'm noticing how much emotional trauma from my past is a direct result of my dysphoria. I found this blog post of mine from 2011 which knocked me on my ass.\n\n&gt;  Had a dream last night that I killed someone. I hung her. Stuffed the body in a black garbage bag and stuffed it into a closet with intention of digging it up and burying it in the desert later. We were at some kind of party, and I had to rejoin the group and act normal.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I could barely walk, I was so nervous. It took every ounce of my strength to keep my composure, but I did it and I did it damn well. I thought I was doing great, until someone mentioned they had lost something. They decided to go upstairs and look for it. In the room where I had hidden the body. I sipped my drink and waited. Then she screamed. She had found it. Within minutes, the police were swarming the crime scene. They had sprawled the body out on the bed and were peeling apart the separate elements and separating them into evidence piles.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I lost it. I was convinced that they were going to catch me; that they would be able to extract my DNA from the rope around her neck or find my sweat on the garbage. My typically logical and level-headed mind ran rampant with wild ideas and accusations. Nevertheless, I left. I got in my car and drove down the empty road in the middle of the desert, with that heavy and desperately uncomfortable feeling that I was being hunted.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I\u2019ve been up for two hours. It still feels like they\u2019re coming for me.\n&gt; \n&gt;  I\u2019ve always felt my dreams were symbolic. So what the hell does that unbelievably disturbing dream mean? Who did I kill, and how could I have possibly MURDERED someone? Why did I hide her in a closet? Why was it so sudden? What did the desert mean?\n&gt; \n&gt;  And why, in the waking world, am I still looking over my shoulder and listening for sirens?\n\nMy wife and I were almost laughing at how on-the-nose it sounds. I'm literally describing a girl I killed and hid in a closet, the fear of being found out, and choosing the nothingness of the desert over facing the body and consequences I left behind, like choosing to pretend to live as a male in an empty existence rather than embracing the real me. This comes after all of these realizations that all my life I've tried my hardest to extinguish any kind of femininity in my appearance and behavior, to fit the definition of \"man\" I was expected to embody.\n\nNot sure why I'm posting this. I'm still just stunned, but this old post is one of the most powerful bits of evidence I've found that I am trans, and have been the whole time. That's still... really difficult for me to say. I guess I figure that if I'm going through my past to help validate my feelings of being trans, someone on a similar journey might find it interesting that my subconscious was essentially screaming that I was trans six years before I figured it out.", "date": "2017-02-28 03:55:24", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5wlr1j/no_idea_what_im_doing/", "author": "Sparks759"}, {"title": "How much T do females get when transitioning to males?", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2017-02-28 12:28:21", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5wnp71/how_much_t_do_females_get_when_transitioning_to/", "author": "BadNerfAgent"}, {"title": "I'm at an impasse", "text": "For two years now, I've been decided I'm trans (MtF).

You may think like me, or you may not. Either way, let's respect each other, and if need be, extensively discuss this, alright?\n\nI will say it bluntly: At the end of the day, gender serves no purpose, and should be disregarded. EXCEPT if it helps you cope with your problems, that is.\nAnd even if so, WHAT IS gender exactly? We can argue, read, point out more material to read and educate ourselves. But in the end, it's just a bunch of roles, assigned to one gender or the other. And this disregards the non-binary community as a whole.\n\nSo, gender is just the set of socially imposed rules passed on generation to generation. Men have to work and earn money, while women have to raise children, prepare food and clean the house.\n\nObviously, those roles are being redefined and defied, because they are, well, outdated. So...is gender outdated as well?\n\n\nAll of this comes from me deciding wether or not I'm trans or not. See, I'm a 26 male, whom never had any kind of dysphoria, but always felt inclined towards a more classical 'female' set of roles. I like cooking, I'm great with kids, and so on.\nShould my entire gender identity change on a whim just because society keeps telling me that the things I like are \"for girls\" ?\nOf course not.\n\nSo, I believe, in an ideal world, if we abolish gender roles, we kind of abolish gender as a whole, too. Which is great, since anyone who wants to identify with a gender would be able to, without much fuss. And anyone wishing NOT to identify with any gender would be able to do that as well.\n\nI hope I was at least somewhat clear with my point.

I've had a history of having, let's call it, bouts of transness; where I'll get fixated on the subject, and the stories of trans people, and drawing similarities to my own life. I'll analyze all the stories and compare them to my own, and often I'll find a lot in common. Or maybe convince myself that I've found a lot in common. But right when I start to take steps to make some real changes, I'll regress and suppress the event for months or even years like it never happened. I don't know if this is because I didn't have a strong support system and got scared by the kickback from my family compiled with other issues, or, if I am literally just fucking with myself because there is something  wrong with me.\nThe first time I did this, I was around eighteen or so. A guy had come out in my very queer friend group, and there were some other people coming out about being trans. All of that really made me question myself, like a whole lot; and at the time, it added up that I was trans too. So I came out as nonbinary, and later ftm. At the time, I didn't receive the same support or acceptance as these other people did; long story short, they didn't really take me seriously. I wasn't, at the time, a stereotypical masculine person. I had a lot of anxiety and depression. That and other teenage, college drama added up and I eventually left the friend group, and started to dress more androgynous and trying to present female. I still lived with my parents, and masculine presentation upset them. That and people were fucking terrible because it was the goddamn sticks.\n\nFlash forward a few years, I pretty much did the same thing again. Came out as trans at a school, started living as a guy, and then my parents flipped out and I realized I needed to be able to support myself without parents doing random pirouettes off fucking handles. So I enlisted in the military like a fucking genius, and here we are a few years later thinking about the same bullshit again. \nI'm sorry if this is kind of convoluted, I'll wrap it up. Right now I'm presenting as a female at work, not like I have much of a choice. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm even human; pretty disassociated, angry and depressed 90% of the time. But I don't know if that's due to the environment, which basically fucks up everyone equally, or, if it's because of the environment and repressed trans crap. I'll go months or years without thinking about this stuff, just riding my little bicycle along, and then it's like I try to put a stick between the spokes and knock my ass over. So I guess I'm wondering if any of you have ever met a cisgender person who was just such a mess about stuff that they convinced themselves they were trans? I know that sounds silly, but I'm really just tired of dealing with this crap on my own. \n", "date": "2017-03-01 23:18:46", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/5wzjk3/can_a_cisgender_person_get_confused_about_their/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Dont know what to do really depressed", "text": "I really need some advice because i have the feeling im getting stuck at where i am.\n\nI've always felt like im different from the others and couldn't find my own spot, i always dreamed about wakeing up as a girl the next day like nothing changed at all.

I shrugged it off as a rather hollow invitation at the time (i'm not sure why) but still said yes, a long with lots of other people.\n\nLast night it became a reality, and just like he'd told me stories of previous year's get togethers, lots of people backed out when push came to shove. From my perspective it was just going to be him, a mutual friend i met through him (guy #2), and myself going. Both of them know i'm trans, and both of them are super accepting and supportive, so I absolutely went for it.\n\nShortly after I found out that another guy, someone I don't know and have never spoken too before is going also (guy #3), that's fine, no biggie i'm sure he's great.\n\nGuy #3 is talking to guy #2 (in dms) and asking questions about me, he asks what my name is, now guy #2 is so freaking precious  he panics and asks guy #1 (who i'm closer with) to ask me instead, because and I quote:\n\n&gt;i feel weird asking cause it feels like im dropping an ultimatum like im in any place to be doing that\n\nI had been planning to hopefully go as myself the whole time I was there with them, and this extra guy shouldn't impact that plan really, so I just said to tell him my real name (not deadname) and if worst comes to worst it's a gender neutral name anyway, even though the last thing I want associated with me and that name is boymode, but, hey, whatever.\n\nSo after all the details are settled and bookings are made and stuff I go to bed with a big smile on my face, I don't really sleep that much and spend the whole night in my head planning outfits. (Lol)\n\nCome morning my cat wakes me up for some breakfast, normally she wakes my mum up, but i guess i was restless enough to get all the attention this morning. After i'm properly awake and about to get up she climbs onto my bed and curls up next to me (something she literally never does, she's developed an aversion to cuddles for some reason) now i'm quietly squeeing into my pillow that the cat is curled up next to me.\n\nWhen she finally get's sick of lying next to me (after a good 5 minutes, go kitty!) we get out of bed and I pull on some dirty shorts from h&amp;m that i wore yesterday. Normally I wear my shorts around my hips in boymode and not around my waist, but this morning i just pulled them up to my waist without even thinking.\n\nAs I turn around to head out the door I stop dead and stare at the mirror, my room was still heaps dark so I was mostly just a silhouette in the mirror but since when have i had a narrow waist?! my shoulders are still way wider than my hips are, but with this new found narrow waist my body almost has some shape.\n\nIn the low light i couldn't make out any of my stupid body hair, and my bed-head was hanging loosely down in front of my shoulders, holy shit i actually liked what i saw in the mirror for the first time in... ever?\n\nI head into the bathroom (more light) and put my hair up in a high ponytail, again, something i never normally do, and go feed the cat / make coffee.\n\nI'm sitting here cross legged on the couch with my cat next to me, a big shit eating grin on my face, and tears in my eyes.

If anyone has any suggestions on a different place to ask, I'd be happy to try elsewhere.  Second, I'm truly sorry if I accidentally say something offensive.  I'm a cis man and don't have a lot of experience with the trans community, other than a superficial understanding and support.  So, here's the situation.\n\nI received a Facebook friend request a couple weeks ago from someone I didn't recognize, but we had some mutual friends so I decided to approve.  I noticed (and here's something that might be offensive) that they were a trans woman, but didn't really think anything of it.\n\nA few days later, I saw the popular post that was going around about the scientist who used evidence to refute someone saying that gender was a simple black and white issue and I shared it.  The new friend liked it and wrote something to the effect of, \"[Mutual friend] also shared this, I love you both!\"  That's a lot more familiar than what a casual acquaintance would say, so I started looking closer at their profile.  I recognized who they were, and it was one of my best friends from high school.  To be honest, I was dumbfounded.  The last time I saw them was when I went to their wedding a couple of years ago, but since they moved out of state I didn't really keep in touch (because I'm terrible at that).\n\nI guess my question is, what do I say?  I want to reach out to her, because she's undergone a huge life change.  I have a lot of questions for her, about her transition, about her marriage, about her family, but I don't want to bombard her.  I think the questions are coming from a sincere place, but I don't want to draw attention to her trans identity.  I want to say something about not realizing who she was when I first accepted the request, but I don't want to draw attention to the fact that I could recognize her as trans.  Like I said before, that seems like it would be offensive to say.  \n\nAnyways, I would really appreciate any advice.

I was added to a secret group on Facebook and I've started to contribute to the group somewhat. \n\nRecently someone posted in the group and addressed everyone thus: \n\n\"Hey clits! [rest of post]\" \n\nIn response, I started a thread which asked people not to use body-part words to conflate womanhood, as that is exclusionary to some trans women (bear in mind I don't know the make-up of the group as far as if any trans-women/gnc/non-binary peeps are present, though I did wait a few hours to see if anybody else would raise this issue and nobody did). \n\nThe post asked respectfully if people could take some time to think through why we would use body-part names as stand-ins/shorthand for 'women' and to reflect on how that might be exclusionary to some people who do not have those body parts but who nevertheless ARE women. \n\nThe thread was pretty badly derailed into loads of people being annoyed that they apparently are no longer allowed to celebrate or talk about their body parts or experiences related to those body parts. Though I reiterated a bunch of times that that was not my point, people persisted in mis-reading my post and making it all about how they were apparently being silenced. There was a lot of 'us vs them' going on as well, which was sad. \n\nOk, so that's the background. \n\nFor me, I want to be a good ally. I believe strongly that its not up to trans (or other oppressed groups) to always instigate discussions to drive progressive change, and that its up to me to use my privilege to help create safer spaces, whether or not people from that oppressed group are present (yet) or not.

I've been struggling with accepting myself as a male since I was 4, but my parents repressed me since the first symptoms. I remember that once, I think I was 5, my mother woke up and found me using her makeup and in my sister's clothes. She scolded me for doing so. I think she talked to my father about it and since then they started to \"train\" me as a boy, but I only realized that recently. So, any feminine behaviour was repressed, not severely, they just really taught me how to be a boy in a loving way, and I'm pretty sure they always thought this was the best for me.  \nSome years later, I changed to a new school and boys there were very aggressive and violent, so I had to sacrifice any fragility I had in order to survive there. I've become aggressive and manly so boys wouldn't pick me up. I think I had a fight every month there.  \nAfter I left this school, I decided to let my hair grow (I\u2019m a musician so that\u2019s normal), and in my teenage years people would often mistake me for a girl and, even though I denied it, I really loved it.  \nI have always felt attracted to girls so I repressed my urges to dress as one for as long as I could, but it didn\u2019t last long.  I tried to keep this just as a hidden fetish or something, but I know it has deep roots. I can\u2019t deny that if I could, I would be a girl\u2026 but Brazil is the country that most kills transgender people in the world, and I would have to leave my family if I decided to transition, therefore I wouldn\u2019t have money even to survive (not that easy to find a job here, especially for a transgender person), not to mention I\u2019m not sure if I would ever be capable of finding a female partner to share life with or live up to my expectations as a woman.  \nSo, I\u2019ve been trying to just let this go but I can\u2019t. And these mixed feelings are torturing me, I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been so anxious and depressed that I\u2019m almost dropping college, and music does not satisfy me anymore.

I thought figuring out it was dysphoria would make it easier, but instead I've gotten worse knowing I can't try to \"fix\" it. I've come out to some of my closer friends already and so far no one's reacted negatively, so that's good at least. I desperately want to start transitioning or at least start presenting female or see a therapist or something, but my home situation really prevents any of this. My parents are part of a cult (Jehovah's Witnesses) and because I was born into it I'm stuck in it too, and they have a really negative view of anything regarding the LGBT community (my dad unironically compared gay people to terrorists once). I'm not even allowed to go out with friends at all or even see people not in the cult outside of school because they're afraid it'll make me worship Satan or something. I'm still in high school and don't have a job and my parents would definitely kick me out of the house if they found out I was trans. It's gotten extremely hard to get out of bed in the morning, my grades have taken a serious hit, all I want to do all day is sleep, I've been avoiding talking to people more, and I'm feeling more suicidal then I ever have before (Haven't and don't plan on trying to kill myself though).

I felt super uncomfortable when I was being patted down. I was afraid the guy was going to touch me somewhere inappropriate. He didn't, but I just realized I've never felt that way about my body before. I'm usually just annoyed that I'm being patted down.\n\nThere was a dude in line for the concert who had apparently drank too much too fast. He was pretty out of it. I offered to his girlfriend to get him some water, and she immediately hugged me. That felt good. :) I bought ginger ale instead (because I thought it would help settle his stomach) from a shop across the street and brought it back to him. She thanked me and asked me for my name. I gave it to her (it's an androgynous name), and it seemed like she referred to me as a \"person\" to her boyfriend because she wasn't sure how I identified, which is fine with me. I intentionally picked an androgynous nickname a few months ago to gauge whether I pass or not. I may change it later, but right now I don't currently identify as female, just non-conforming male.\n\nThe bathroom situation is getting really uncomfortable. I'm still using the men's restroom, but one time I was throwing out my paper towel when some guy came in and looked noticably traumatized. I asked him if he was okay and he just gave me a weird face. I think I passed for a split second which is why he freaked out. Then I talked to him and threw a wrench into it with my voice. :|\n\nI don't really feel comfortable using the urinals anymore, because I need to resituate everything every time I go and it's easier to do in the stall. Also I've just started wearing wired so I'm constantly having to fuss with my straps and positioning. I'm learning that if the wire comes up too high in the middle that it digs into my chest... Ouch. I've been nervous ever since the freak out guy that someone who is not from my company (it's a rental complex that my company owns 1 3/4 floors. My floor is the 3/4 one) would come into the bathroom right as I was coming out of the stall and I would surprise them.\n\nMy sister's graduation is coming up. I try to avoid cross dressing *too much* whenever family is around, which usually equates to wearing a less obvious bralette and a neutral top, but still wearing makeup and nail polish, women's pants, etc. I would really rather not have to jump through those hoops at all, because I feel like of all people I should feel comfortable around my family, but I actually feel more comfortable at work. I just don't want to upset them too much. Recently this has equated to not visiting family as much anymore.\n\nWork has been... Interesting. I know one other Christian who is in support of me there.

We're very good friends though, and I've started to open up to her about everything, and she's been giving me advice here and there. She's not uncomfortable with me at all, which I really appreciate.\n\nI have crushes on a few guys at work, but I don't feel driven to pursue them, because I personally feel that's wrong, and as I said to my counselor, \"I can appreciate a good looking guy but that doesn't mean I want to be in a relationship with one.\" I feel attracted to girls.

The only circumstances I don't dress up as much are when I'm with family, because I don't want to upset them.

I've had a bunch of fights with my wife, but I think we're going to go through this together - fingers crossed. I decided to tell my parents about how I'm feeling, as a kind of heads-up about what I'm going through - my mom was unconditionally supportive, and even tried to stop using gendered words on the phone, which was really sweet :) it just came to a head and I needed to get it out. She told my dad, who I've not spoken to yet, and I'm a little scared of that conversation but I think there are going to be a lot of scary comversations going forward. I'm not convinced I am trans, yet, because apparently it could be a side effect of my medication, maybe? Or something?

I realized I can express myself better if I write it all out, so here it is:\n\n\"It's hard to even know where to start with something like this, so I'll just come right out with it: I'm transgender.\n\nI can already hear your response in my head-- your skepticism, your arguments. \n\n\"People like that realize when they're young.\"  \n\"But you never did [insert stereotypical behavior here].\"\n\"You do plenty of masculine things!\"\n\nI know. It's not an easy thing to come to terms with and it certainly wasn't easy for me, but I need you to. I have enough doubts for the two of us and then some, so while I struggle to figure this all out and find myself what I need from you is just acceptance and understanding.\n\nThis aspect of myself is something I've known about since elementary school, though I didn't have the context or understanding to make sense of it at the time. I wonder if you remember that time you found a lost earring and one of those fake stick on nails that I had collected from school and hidden behind my shelf. You asked me why and I, red-faced, could only stammer that I didn't know. This was no lie, I truly did not know, it was simply a compulsion. I saw these 'feminine' objects and was inexplicably drawn to them.\n\nI've contemplated and struggled with this more actively for about ten years now. Along with many other people like me, it became more apparent and inescapable around puberty. Since the time I started to develop an attraction to girls, my fantasies have almost invariably involved imagining myself as a girl, and when I saw someone I found attractive, my feelings were not simply a matter of attraction but also of jealousy. I have always been overly fixated on their clothing, their makeup, their femininity, because I wanted that for myself. Movies or TV shows where a male and female character switch bodies have always particularly fascinated me, and now I know why. I would often dream of some magical being from one of my video games casting a spell and transforming me into a beautiful girl. I don't want to go into more sordid details, but suffice it to say that these feelings continued into and throughout high school.\n\nI have always been insecure about my masculinity, as you well know. My height, my size, my facial hair and other features, my stoicism-- there was not a single day as far back as I can remember where I didn't have these things on my mind, gnawing at me. Even as many of these characteristics improved, my insecurity surrounding them only grew. How could I ever be secure in something which doesn't suit me, some Platonic masculine ideal I could never and would never achieve. I wanted these things because I had learned that these are the traits which make a man, but it was merely an illusion. I have been hiding behind a facade of masculinity for so long that it will take a long time to become acquainted with an identity I never allowed to properly develop. I'm sure living with someone as hyper-masculine and closed minded as dad didn't help. In the past few weeks even as I was terribly anxious over exams and horribly conflicted about this issue, something changed abruptly. These insecurities disappeared almost like flipping a switch and for the first time in over a decade, I have developed some semblance of peace in this respect. I'm obviously still dissatisfied with my body, no surprise given my situation, but the insecurities of masculinity which have dominated my consciousness in public and private for so long have finally eased.\n\nThe past few months have truly been a special kind of hell. As studying proceeded on schedule and my anxiety improved with medication but still lingered, there was nothing left to hide behind anymore. I was finally forced to confront this spectre of distress and discomfort which accompanies me everywhere, and has for so long. I had considered this explanation before, but I always figured these feelings were just some odd sexual desire and the sense of shame which might accompany it. The reality though is that people who aren't trans don't constantly imagine themselves as women regardless of their sexual interests. I'm also not ashamed about how I feel, I'm not ashamed of any of these things. I am who I am and there is no point in fighting it. What I really feared was the disapproval of others-- not of society at large, but of the people whom I care about. You wonder why I avoided talking to you about my anxieties, why I lied and told you I was fine when I wasn't. How could I explain something like this? I didn't even understand or accept it myself until recently. \n\nThe timing with my exams was certainly unfortunate, but life seems to have a way of throwing things at you when it's most inconvenient. Imagine how hard it has been to focus on my final preparations and indeed on the exams themselves with all this on my mind, along with legitimately being mentally exhausted from the endless cycle of stress, revision, and exams. So after tons of reading (as you know I always do), after speaking to others like me, and after much agonizing contemplation, this was the inescapable conclusion. Hopefully you can come to accept this, even if it takes some time. I can only imagine that it's hard to lose a son, or at least your perception of the person you think you've come to know, but it's still me-- the parts of me that matter anyway. You've sometimes wished you had a daughter, right? Well now you can. That feels so weird to say, and I think it probably will for quite a while, but it's the truth.\n\nThis also provides some context for my depression and anxiety issues. I'm sure I'm predisposed anyway, but their persistence is telling. Even at my best points while being treated, even during times when I've truly had nothing on my mind, a relentless nagging discomfort has been present. It has pervaded my every waking moment for so long that I don't know what it feels like to simply be content and happy. Things which bring me joy are always accompanied by a voice in the back of my mind that makes it feel wrong... I've become so accustomed to stress and fear that I feel bad even about feeling good. Well I deserve to be happy. I deserve to find peace. If I don't embrace this, I don't know that I ever will.\n\nOh and one last thing, please don't worry about what my friends might think. I have always surrounded myself with tolerant and open-minded people because I find the ones who think like dad to be repulsive. All the ones who matter to me know at this point, and none have been anything less than fully supportive and accepting.

I think I already knew this, since I heard about the kids who were transgender. Anyway, I want to be a boy. I want to cut my hair short before the dance. I want to wear what a boy would wear in the 50s to the dance. I don't want to wear frilly girly clothes. You can't force me to wear that, especially now. I'll still get stuff from the girl section but not the girly pink frilly stuff. I want to be called E*. I'm to go by he/him instead of she/her. I want to be your son. I am 100% sure. I really hope you support and respect me. Also, I'm bi, so I like boys and girls, but that doesn't have really anything to do with my being trans. I'm still gonna be me. \n\n*I've omitted his chosen name for privacy reasons. \n\nWe got his hair cut and got him a cool greaser style outfit for the dance which was on Friday. The refusal to wear girly clothes isn't really anything new, for the most part I've let him have a hand in picking out the clothes I buy for him to wear (his mother and I are divorced so I don't know what she buys for him) and he's never really liked dresses. The only time I've made him wear a dress was for weddings and funerals which there have only been 2 of the former recently and thankfully only one of the latter. \n\nHis mother and I have looked into and are signing him up for group sessions with other transgender kids his age (they run a concurrent group for the parents while the kids are in session). Meanwhile his mother and I are both updating our respective families (this is by his request, I think talking to us was the extent of his bravery for now). We also spoke with his teacher to let her know in case anything happens/comes up in the last couple weeks of school. \n\nSo I'm posting now to ask, what else should I be doing?  Those of you who have told your parents/families, what things did they do that were great? Or what things did they do that were not so great and I should avoid?\n\nThanks for your time. \n\nTL;DR: My 10yo son is transgender.

I'm glad I found this subreddit and so happy to see there are many others like me. Many others who are very confused and lost, and I am that without a doubt.\n\nI'm 26 and was born a male. I never had much thought about being male, I mostly maintained a position of neutrality towards my gender and genitalia. Assuming the normal role as a male in society wasn't something I chose but instead it just happened. Did it make me unhappy? No, not necessarily, but I was absolutely sure that it didn't make me happy.\n\nMy sexuality has always been mysterious even to myself. I can firmly say I'm attracted to any human regardless of their identity, gender, role, or genitalia. I like both female and male sex organs. As an easy escape from explanation I just say I am bisexual or pansexual depending on the context, and it seems to cover everything....except not.\n\nI have struggled immensely with whether or not I am transgender. On one hand, being a male for the rest of my life seems....acceptable. Doable. Less complicated. On the other hand, I desire very greatly to identify as a girl and live my life as a girl. I feel dysphoric about my body but not my genitals. I don't hate my penis, I just much rather wish it was a vagina.\n\nI have never felt a sense of inner sexiness from presenting as a male....however every time I wear panties I feel like sexiness exudes from me. I have not ever been able to fully dress as a girl, with makeup and wig and the whole nine yards. I do own some clothes mainly for crossdressing under my boy clothes, panties etc. However I think if I was able to make myself up and look somewhat passable, I would feel the happiest and most love for myself I have ever felt.\n\nI felt at least some of these feelings before I ever found the 'sissy fetish', and I have always had a strange attraction to panties from a very young age. However after finding sissy training, porn, hypnos, etc. I began to think this was a more serious part of who I am and not just something that's fun to jerk off to, and I also began noticing issues with myself. I do not like when hypnos or training refers to me as a sissy, and especially not when they refer to me a 'faggot.' When I am in that state of mind, when it's sissy playtime, I am a girl. No doubt about it. I want to be called a girl, treated like one, and presented as one, not at all as a sissy male with a fetish.\n\nNow why am I confused? Sounds like I'm transgender right? Except for whatever reason it's like I'm okay with just being a male. Even though everything screams from within that I want to be a girl, I want to be feminine. It's like there's a voice in my head who says 'that's silly, you're a boy and no one will ever accept you as anything else' and I just listen to it. I have purged two or three times and not always regretted it right away, and seem to have always come back to at least wearing my big girl panties again.\n\nSigh, I just don't know what to do. And no, I don't have a therapist and have not had the resources to reach out.

I feel so guilty... \n\nFurthermore my mother keeps talking about \"how I'm lucky I have such a nice body and I'm so handsome and I have no disabilities\" and how I'm doing something \"unnecessary\" that's \"voluntarily putting me in danger for no reason\" (father's out of the picture atm).

(But for the record, I am bio female in their 20s). \n\n\nI guess I can start off by kind of giving you an outlook. Okay lets say this; for most trans people....the carpet doesn't match the house...the carpet is pink but the house is blue. With me, the carpet is pink and the house is pink...but its like...two different shades of pink if that makes sense. Or I can even say the carpet is pink and the house is pink with blue all mixed in to make some weird bluish pinkish colour idk how to really explain it. But I can say I was always masculine. I played football with the boys in school and the rules would always be every girl was two-hand touch....except for me. I was tackle. \n\n\nMy older brother would cross-dress me too. Would call me his \"baby bro\" and see if people would fall for it. Usually they did because I was so young &amp; nothing filled out yet. That or I was always dressed very androgynous when he was around. Thing is, I preferred that. I used to burn the skirts my mother would make me wear. I would cry in church because I had to wear those dresses. Getting older, I stole my Dad and my brothers clothes and wore them but I never hid it. I just went to school or played outside in them...I was always into just girls until 18 when I got into guys and masturbation and all that. So everyone just thought I was a butch...including me. But like I felt happy wearing the clothes. Thats all I can really say. \nTo fast forward so this isnt really long, I thought I was ftm in high school. So I started passing and changed my pronouns among friends. It felt right, at first. But I still had moments where I felt like a full on girl. I had moments where I wanted to wear dresses and eyeliner. So I thought I was bigender....and that didn't feel right either after a while.\n\n\nNow...I don't know. I started getting backlash from family and friends, so I just swallowed it all together and became the cisgendered girl I am today. Now that I am older and have been with both genders, I am sexually attracted to men but not romantically attracted to them...and vice versa with women...with women I was SO BORED but I am SO physically and romantically attracted..But I am a sexual being, and they lack the..plumbing..that I am attracted to. Part of me wonders if it has anything to do with it. \n\n\nI guess I am also questioning it so hard right now too because I found out my girlfriend is actually mtf, and being with her just...brings the dude out in me. I mean I stopped with any makeup, stopped shaving the..erm...\"areas\"...and last week, I experimented again. I put away all of the femme clothes I was making myself wear and bought new ones all from the mens section (even complete with boxer briefs) and I am much more comfortable. I have my days...I wore a dress(ish) to work once...But I wear dress shirts everyday...I told myself I wasn't going to tell her or anyone because of A) the backlash and B ) She goes through real shit being mtf, being on HRT, wanting SRS, and I feel like trying to talk to her about petty feelings when I don't even want to transition would invalidate her. I know its ridiculous. But its true. I feel like she's at 10 and I am at 1 so I am unimportant right now. But I was so happy and comfy I took pictures and she happened to see it. And she told me \"You wear whatever you want.\" that was pretty much it. I am not sure if she would even support it, being that she is a lesbian.\nAnywhore~ When I look into the mirror...I don't see a guy. I can't imagine a guy like I used to. But one day I was dating a guy who wished I was more \"feminine\" so this girl did my makeup and gave me an outfit...I cried infront of the mirror. I felt ugly and I hated who I was staring at. It wasn't me. And I hated that it is who everyone wants me to be because I know for sure I am not that person. I recently wore another fully male-oriented outfit to work. But instead of boying up completely I wore some small eyeliner with it and didn't try to hide my boobs so much...I loved it. It was perfect. I felt comfortable. I felt right mixing the male appearance with feminine attributes.\nSo if being a boy in most aspects is right...but I don't feel I am ftm or bigender...But I also don't feel like just a cisgendered girl....I don't know what I'd classify myself as. I guess I am more looking for a community than a label so that I can maybe find someone like me and ask more questions. Maybe even find someone to help me find the courage to come out to my girlfriend (sounds crazy right? Scared to come out to someone who is trans...that you might be trans).

I went through a period of several years where I was closeted and anguishing over taking things further. Like another post I saw on here, it kind of started out sexual for me, I got curious about having breasts, but I didn't exactly have dysphoria *before*. Eventually that led to taking herbal hormones, which was a bad freaking idea because I got really sick, but they did work a tiny bit. I was prescribed hormones for reels last November. My doctor only requires informed consent, and I've never seen a gender specialist, only a state licensed Christian counselor who couldn't really help me that much. I love the changes and I started dressing up a bit a month or two ago. Socially I feel a bit cut off from people because I'm worried that they're either silently or actively judging me, but I'm finding that sometimes I will pass.\n\nEver since I realized I could pass, I'm getting progressively more annoyed when people call me sir or he. I think it's mainly because of my voice. I avoid talking too much as a result, and try to pitch up my voice a *tiny* bit when I do. I've thought about getting voice surgery, but it's permanent, and since I want to get a tracheal shave also, it's going to be at least four months before I can take advantage of that (three months for shave recovery, then one month voice rest after vocal). I know that I need to have voice training anyway regardless of whether I have surgery or not, but I would rather wait until after the surgery to start because there's going to be some relearning involved, and I want to avoid sounding like Minnie Mouse in front of my coworkers.\n\nI have separate groups of people I identify to differently. I'm hesitant to tell people who knew me before I started transitioning more openly to make the change irt pronouns and gendered language because I feel like it's going to cause some dissonance for them, and I'm still not 100% sure that I want to keep going. I mean, I like it when people who have always known me as female address me as such, but I don't feel comfortable forcing that on people who already knew. To those people, identifying as female means that I'm trans. To people where I've only ever identified as female, I'm just a girl with slightly weird body proportions and a deeper voice. It's probably a little silly that I'm worried about that at all since I'm basically fully out everywhere.\n\nI'm just getting really frustrated about being in between, and still slightly doubtful about whether I want to live this way for the rest of my life.", "date": "2017-06-18 01:02:41", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/6hwzy7/getting_really_impatient_with_transitioning/", "author": "widget2143"}, {"title": "Couldn't not post this outfit after getting compliments from a friend. \ud83d\ude3a Still not sure what to do with my hair though.", "text": "", "date": "2017-06-19 03:32:39", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/6i3z8t/couldnt_not_post_this_outfit_after_getting/", "author": "widget2143"}, {"title": "Am I trans?", "text": "Hi there people of /r/trans.\n\nI don't know if I'm trans or what.

I am wondering if I can get some advise and experiences from you regarding the first while after you transitioned. My step brother is 17 and has recently transitioned from female to male and I have no problem supporting them. I had many friends in high school go through the same thing and I was there for them in any way I could be and would like to be for my step brother as well. \n\nMy only problem is they have always been an attention seeker. They were the divorce child and by that I mean the child who was spoiled and given everthing because they were so young when the divorce happened and then in the past 3 years it sort of wore off. People stopped paying as much attention to them and then all of a sudden they decide they are now a he. Still fine to me and his family. \n\nThe problem continues in that he only hang out with trans friends now. Most of which are 3 years younger than him. And the only thing we ever hear about if being trans. Does not matter to who it where it when. The only conversation you can have with him is that he is trans and gay. Even if you just don't respond he keeps going on and on. He will change the topic of conversation to said topic. And heaven forbid you mess up and call him a she or by their original name. You will get a speech about how you don't support him and don't care about him. This also happens to his mother though who has been nothing but supportive. But has a degenerative brain disorder that effects their memory and speech sometimes.\n\nI'm at the point I can't stand to be near them because all they talk about is how they are adding a new colour to this trans flag. And I want to die my hair the colour of the trans flag. And this one person out of 60 people called me a she so I need to get pins to state my prounoun. And on and on and on. It was never like this when my other friends went through it and I'm struggling. \n\nI guess overall I just want to know how I can support him without wanting to punch him. And also if anyone else was this pushy and how best to handle it. To me I think he does feel more comfortable as a boy. But where does it become raising awareness and just looking for attention. \n\nI am sorry if I offend anyone by any of this.

Sorry if you do.\n\nI probably only came out to myself as trans about a year ago. But in college, I experimented with homosexuality and cross dressing. It was fun, and I had a boyfriend who was really into it. My brothers knew. And I never really tried to hide it, but every few years I realize my circle of friends are further and further removed from that part of my life, and I get worried about it coming up. It's like coming out of the closet again and again, only never quite really doing it.\n\nAs far as my circle of friends care I'm a cis-hetero male. And,  while I'm juggling complex feelings on the whole subject, I'm pretty ok with it. I work with kids too, and any sign of femininity would cause me loads of problems. So I've been outwardly pretty masculine for quite a while. Like, ten or eleven years since that college fling.\n\n\nSo I'm at a party tonight with some good friends (from later in my college career)  And in walks this guy, who keeps giving me the eye. Later I find he's a good friend of my college boyfriend. He was kind of a prick, but he's ok now, I guess. We talk a bit, and he starts talking about my ex, and how he (the ex) is transitioning now, and then suddenly shifts gears and congratulates me on doing well, and how I grew up and how I'm so manly now.\n\nAnd I'm sitting here, a few tequila down, thinking \"Last time this guy saw me I was in a sundress with waist length hair practically passing. Most of our interactions involved me snogging his friend, or heading into another room to snog his friends junk. What the hell is this guy thinking.\"\n\n\nSo it was just waves crashing over me for a while. Did I want him to stop acknowledging my masculinity? Was I afraid he was going to out me to my current friends, who both know and don't know? Do bi, closeted, or otherwise people who are currently \"Acting straight/cis\" ever get away from this constant feeling of being re-outed and re-explaining yourself to the same people?\n\nAnd worse.... he said he was going to tell the ex how I was doing... do I even want contact with them? No. But maybe their courage with finally transitioning could help me? Or I could help them? Ugh, god... is it ok to just not care and leave exes as exes?\n\n\nThis isn't really organized. Thank you for reading, or just letting me rant.\n\nTL:DR;\nOld acquaintance shows up at a party. They knew me when I cross dressed a lot, and told me my ten year past ex boyfriend came out as trans.

I really am anxious to get it done as soon as possible because I feel like it's preventing me from passing, and it's slowly driving me insane because I'm almost full time and I just don't want to admit it to myself, and I feel like once I open my mouth everything falls apart. I was considering getting a shave done first, but that will delay the voice surgery and reduce the amount of adjustment they can make (Yeson strongly cautioned against having it done by anyone except Facial Team when I emailed them), and I've been told that my Adam's apple isn't that prominent by a few people including the surgeon during my consult. I have considered doing voice therapy, but I've tried doing some voice training on my own and even if I was successful I'd feel like my voice was fake, and the anxiety about slipping up would be too much for me.\n\nI get extremely agoraphobic on the weekends.

I remember a time before it mattered as much that I was a boy, I was just a kid, and I was happy being a kid. I remember a time where it didn't seem to matter to me if I was playing a \"boy's\" game or a \"girl's\" game. Then I started to feel kind of.. odd at school, especially when the class was split up into boys and girls. I felt left out when the girls went off somewhere, and I didn't quite fit in with the guys. In middle school, I found myself wishing that I wasn't who I was. I wanted to be someone else. I wanted to be female (but I mostly suppressed these thoughts, mostly out of fear).\n    \nI grew up in a **very** conservative area, and even being so much as gay or bi (much less trans) was enough to make life a living hell throughout public schooling, so I hid it. I hid it from everyone, even myself. I tried to embrace being a boy so maybe that way I could be satisfied, and not have to change to be happy. That lasted until I got out of high school, and quickly fell apart. I was left after public school wondering who I even was and more importantly who I wanted to be. It took me a long time to realize that the unhappiness I had was right in front of me. I've had dirt poor self esteem and self worth my whole life. I've not hated being a guy, but I feel as though I've been cheated. I've been told I have everything to succeed and be happy, but I feel as though how I was born has hindered me.

I've only come out to my girlfriend, and she's been supremely supportive through this, which has helped me tremendously. I just feel like I'm losing time to be who I want to be. I have absolutely no money to transition, much less get any kind of therapy to help me along the way. I have yet to come out to my roommates (although they are pro-LGBT, which is a godsend), mostly from my own nerves. How can I finally start making progress towards who I want to be?

But if you would like to see me, I would love to show you. I will leave my snapchat, just add me and send me a chat!

I had been pulled in for a visit to a step-relative at the flip side of my country together with my mother and sister, a visit I really did not want to do, but was coaxed in to doing it anyways. Oh well, I thought, it'll only be the weekend. And besides, I would be bringing my laptop with me that would serve as my distraction. Off I went.\n\nAt the time I was a lost, lost person. The little I knew about myself was hampered by a life-long struggle against insecurity and anxiety. Oh, the anxiety was a mess. I never got any proper, \"official\" help for it (which consequently built up as anger inside me). High school was about to end, too, and the pressure to figure your life out, so quickly, was overwhelming. I dealt with this by being my true self, online. It included pretending to be a woman a few times. Unbeknownst to me, it was the perfect set-up for a meltdown.\n\nIt happened during the visit. One of the top posts of /r/lgbt of that day appeared on my front page. It was a drawing of various gendered people promoting love and kindness. It led me to /r/asktransgender. I'm sure, if brains could make noises, it would do a loud click with gears rotating shortly after. My first reaction then was, \"Wait, you are allowed to do this?!\" - turns out, yeah, you are.\n\nIt shattered a lot of my self-imposed limits. It wasn't even just about the gender, but the concept of taking control of your own life. To experiment and try things out. To make your own choices. It just happened to be about gender this time. It felt like the only open road I could go on to explore myself. So, I did.\n\nIt inevitably messed my life up in bad and good ways. My high school was delayed a year. My mental state did a complete meltdown. I changed identity and dropped everyone I knew. But, on the flip side: I became myself, if only with tiny steps. From hormones and from experience. The initial turbulent years could've gone so much more smoother, but it gave me a solid base that I can't set a price tag on.\n\nMy parents initially denied my \"phase\". The gender diagnosis didn't arrive until *three* years later after I had applied for help. And it was only then when they suspected I had a problem other than with gender identity. Last year I got a diagnosis in the autistic spectrum and had legal rights to get help for it. I also got an official prescription for hormones. So there's that.\n\nI also kept doubting whether if I was \"trans enough\", seeing as I never felt an overwhelming feeling of being a woman. I never had the typical history of a transgender person, and I never thought about going further than hormones. This led me to try, over and over, to be more female than I actually felt.\n\nI just waited, waited, and waited for the turbulent years to be over. And eventually, it did. I no longer feel obligated to pick either female, or male. I feel comfortable going with just hormones, with an androgynous voice, and with a feminine appearance. I feel secure in myself, not just my gender but with everything, and that really is a wonderful feeling.\n\nI guess I'm writing all of this as a reflective piece for myself, and for all of you. One day, five years ago, I also worried whether I would pass or not. I also worried about hormones, about surgery, and about feeling safe and secure in yourself. And I'd like to say that it is possible to someday feel happy with yourself, even for you. You can someday feel hopeful for the future. You can someday feel happy that you get to experience this life.\n\nJust find people who loves and supports you regardless of your choices.

He's a Nurse Practioner. Normally, I don't get along with NP's. Or male Providers. But my initial visits with Klarberg were great. I felt like he listened to me and didn't judge me, as I was nervous and scared about coming out, and I was dealing with the end of a relationship that had lasted a year. I was actually able to start hormones fairly quickly. \n\nBut after being bumped up from 2mg of estradiol to 4mg per day, things changed. When he bumped me up to 6mg he seemed hesitant. I told him that I had been experiencing cramps and the full range of Period Symptomes (bloating, swollen breasts, intestinal distress, period shits, moodiness, some body aches... the standard for a period, although no bleeding obviously.) Instead of listening to me, he dismissed what I was saying as \"impossible\", yet a good portion of Trans women do experience some of these symptoms every month at a pretty regular time. (Information that I only learned AFTER I started dealing with it and my friend pointed out that my complaints sounded exactly like her period. )\n\nMy questions of \"Ok, if it's not that, then what is it?\" Went in one ear and out the other. He refused to even explore the possibility that there might be other causes for these symptoms, instead labeling it as \"a placebo effect\". Dude, up until I had these symptoms, I didn't even know that this could happen. As it stands, I've had period symptoms regularly. Every 4 weeks, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 days. \n\nThen yesterday, he constantly seemed to be wanting to get out of the room. I felt like I was being judged by him, I felt like he wasn't listening to me at all. He started talking about \"Now that your breasts have come in some, I think we should lower your estrogen some. Back down to the 4mg per day.\" Ummm... excuse Me?! I was hoping I could get bumped up again. \"Why? What are you hoping that will accomplish?\" I'm not kidding. That is a direct quote. \n\nMe: \"umm... a more feminine body? Look, I've gotten some ass, and some hips, and some breasts. Yay. But lowering my estrogen at this point will reduce the fat distribution in my ass and legs, which is a huge point of dysphoria for me. It's also going to pretty much halt the breast growth I've had up until now. I have a pretty solid understanding of how this works. Obviously I'm not stupid, I can read my medical charts without a problem. I do not need or want any medical terminology to be dumbed down to layman's terms.\"\n\nKlarberg: \"well, I don't see a reason to bump you up, but I'll leave you at your 6mg per day for now.\" He quickly left after that.\n\nSince then, I've made sure that I'm being switched to a different provider within the clinic, one that I've heard only wonderful things about from the trans community. Turns out, Klarberg is like this a lot. It seems to be something that is brought up about him every time his name comes up in the trans community in Houston. \n\nI'm just SO ticked off. When I called to schedule with a different provider they tried to railroad me in with Klarberg again. I may have been a bit of a bitch about it and told them there was no way in hell that I was going to deal with Klarberg again, that I needed a provider who actually listens to their patients instead of being dismissive.\n\nDoes anyone else have to justify their reason for wanting to be bumped up to the next stage of hormones? Also, Klarberg was refusing to give me Progesterone. He said that he didn't give that out until at least a year, maybe not even then. What the fuck.

Lately, that's been improving, especially after I've come out to my family as a gay transman, but he still has difficulty completely accepting gay male intimacy/sex, and other things that are not conventional views of masculinity. Him, my mom and my sister are all supportive, but I can't help but feel extremely frustrated and even angry when things like this come up.\n\nHe mentioned something about \"trans men\" \"trying too hard\", and I asked \"trans men or trans *women*?\"\nHe was of course talking about trans women. I explained that MTFs are trans *women*, and I am a trans *man*.\nHe said it's \"confusing\", to which I responded: \"it's only confusing because you don't see them as real women or men.\"\nThen he began to say \"well you're a woman-\"\nI'M NOT A WOMAN. We've been over this. They've known for well over a year. Holy shit, I don't understand why this concept is so difficult to grasp. Trans women are real women. Trans men are real men. Why the hell would they be referred to as trans \"men\" if they are trying so hard to escape being seen as male, and vice versa? \n\nNot only am I seriously tired of being reduced to merely weird versions of our assigned genders (\"men who dress as women\"/\"girls who want to be boys\", etc.), I'm annoyed as hell of the people who claim to support me, but don't bother to try to learn or understand what it means to be trans. This kind of half-assedness is unhelpful to say the least. I don't call that support. I call it tolerance, but with their own ignorant views still in place. God damn it.|\n\nEDIT: He also referred to me as a transvestite and didn't get why it was offensive.\nAaaand earlier, he kept telling me he thinks gays are unnatural because anal sex is \"gross\".

I love it here but I know to much about it. Its hard to separate what parts I love and hate because they all blur together under the fog of familiarity. I hope to move to Oregon soon.

So I decided to live in my own head and call it good. It worked. lying to the world was easier than lying to myself. I honestly just kept putting it off. Then all of a sudden I was 19, hated myself, and couldn't think of anything that would make me feel better. So I came out as trans to my parents and then hated myself more. I don't want to be trans. Still don't. It would be so convenient to be a white dude. I got good at lying to people. I'm really good at it. People tell me I'm a bad liar. I agree with them. I cant remember how I felt about being a liar or being trans. I think I wished I didn't feel anything. Not feeling anything would be so convenient. I have a hard time talking about myself.

It feels like I write so much differently than I talk because I write in my head. I didn't speak in my head. I lived in my head and my voice was to lie and protect myself. Now when I talk I don't hear myself. I just hear a tool that I used for lies. And when I try to say how I feel it still feels like a lie because the voice in my head isn't speaking. I loved acting. It felt so real, I was doing the same things I would be doing anyway, putting on faces, making the emotions real because they have to be real to make the lie work. But it was real because the lies moved into the background, into the setting, into the play. Being on stage was beautiful because it was all lies. And I already knew how to tell beautiful lies. I'm scared of lying to myself. I'm not really scared of anything else. What else is there to fear? even the fear of being wrong about my transition is smaller than that. Just a small feature on a larger landscape of terror. But when I tell myself that i feel like a girl, that convenience doesn't mean happiness, and that the only thing required to be honest is to try, I don't feel afraid. And although calling myself a boy everyday for the purposes of convenience comes easily. Saying I'm a boy is as easy a screaming. I can never complete the thought. And when I try to I get so... well i think i'm afraid. And its the thought that counts right? I just wish i could think out loud. When I was in 6th grade I was on a field trip, they called me a girl. And I asked them to stop. And it hurt so much. And then they kept calling me a girl, and I cant remember how I felt about it, but trying to feel bad about it felt so... inconvenient. And I remember wanting to tell them that it was fine they could keep doing it. But I just couldn't find the voice.\n\n(alsoeditedcauseIleftAlotoferrorswhenIsubmitteditsoyea)", "date": "2017-07-12 04:24:28", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/6mrncn/i_wrote_this_for_a_grant_application_im_proud_of/", "author": "the_arting_starvist"}, {"title": "Awkwardly Supportive Parents", "text": "So I feel that the only reason that my parents are at all supportive of me is because they don't want to lose face about their parenting decisions.

I hate that I can't afford any mental help anymore, I wish I was at least still on risperdol even though it wasn't working so maybe I could develop breast tissue for a side effect.\n\nI hate everyone thinking that I am trying to be a man and using anything girly about me as an insult. I hate being told I would look handsome with short hair. I hate that my roommates I'm trying to make peace with don't want me shaving my body hair and think that if we're going to help each other with the shit situation we're all in they should view me as their son.

I hate that I'll never bee good enough, that I'll never beautiful, and I could never have a child.

I hate that even if she would look at me again she'd see me as a boy being weak and slutty trying to look like a girl. I hate that there's nowhere I can be at peace anymore and no one I can trust. I hate that even if I was pretending to be a man my old friends are too busy to listen to me on anything and my co-workers all think I'm queer. I hate that I'd be 100% certain to lose my job if I ever came out to them because it's a christian office. I hate that all of my trans friends I did make no longer have interest in me because treating someone who looks like me with a boy's name online the same way that they treated me before is just weird. \n\nEven if a miracle happened and I was able to afford treatment to look exactly like I wanted and calm my mind and get all the pretty clothes I wanted, no one would ever be able to see me for me anymore.

I hate feeling like nothing I say or do can be trusted because of my mental problems and that no one would stay with me even just for fun. \n\nI hate that it will never fair to any of the rest of you for someone like me to identify as a trans girl because it would make people associate being trans with someone as ugly and messed up and unacceptable as me. I hate that I feel like I'm guilt tripping everyone whenever I try to talk about any of my problems.

Rant.", "text": "Alright so we all know what this is going to be about. First off; i served four years in the australian military, im a trans woman and im going to rant. Enjoy.\n\nI've been seeing this plastered all up and down my facebook feed and of course ive gone anywhere from seeing arguments about the cost, mental illness, surgeries and bigotry. Its pretty intense out there currently.\n\nBut I've got a few points of my own to make, and I'm a tad confused. \n\nOne; I don't think Trumps Trans Ban is about money.\n\nWhy? Let's have a look at some figures. In an analysis, wide and varying numbers of the VA budget have been shown to be several numbers viagara and erectile dysfunction - some 40 million and 80 million respectively. But, the cost of transgender health provision will be somewhere in the figures of 2.5 million to 8.5 million per year - disrupting a negligible amount of a military budget that is twice the combined power of many countries after it.\n\nBut we aren't talking just about surgery here, we are talking about HRT aswell - testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, spironolactone. Mostly, these drugs costs about $60/month in australia - more in the US due to non public health care. But that shouldn't alarm me more than the drinking habits of soldiers.\n\nIn december 2016, it was estimated in a survey that 43% of active duty members were binge drinkers - 67% of those were between 17-25. How much would binge drinking cost the US military? What would be the medical bill for young testosterone pumped men going out and finding trouble on a weekend? Well, it turns out that on average 11,982 service members (that's nearly the full amount of the 15,500 trans members in the US military) need to undergo alcohol reeducation a year- but are we looking at banning alcohol or discharging those members? Where is the storm about alcohol? Why isn't that being banned? How much is the US government paying for soldiers to drink every weekend? Why is binge drinking a more acceptable use of payment than allowing soldiers to purchase hormone replacement therapy? \n\nTwo; Since when, have i been more at risk to be a danger behind a gun because I'm trans?\n\n3 people a day. 3 people a day. Thats the current statistic for police shootings in america - alright, but lets straighten that out; there's no saying how many are criminals and how many are justified and etc etc.  And also, thankyou to our men and women keeping us safe - but seriously, apart from Kristin Beck, who was a SEAL that took part in the Bin Laden raid (god she is a national treasure) how many times do we hear about a trans person shooting someone? Its the same thing with the bathroom problem; there are roughly 700,000 transgender Americans- if being transgender puts the person in the wake of being a pervert, a pedophile, a sex criminal, why aren't we hearing about trans people abusing people in bathrooms? Why isnt it a larger issue? Where are all the headlines about people being assaulted in bathrooms by trans people? Where are they?\n\nHint; they arent there - trans people are like spiders. We are more afraid of cis people than they are of us. Its the same thing with mental illness and being trans; there is no link between pedophilia, sex crime and mental illness and being transgender. None.\n\nThree; And why is wanting medical treatment an issue anyway? \n\nLets think about this  - because this is something im seeing; people dont want me in the military because they are worried that the fact i want to get SRS means im obviously very, very unstable. \n\nNo. The reason i want to get SRS is to be rid of an appendage that doesnt suit my body anymore- on anti androgens, it becomes more difficult to achieve and maintain an errection. Your penis may or may not become something of a useless appendage, which is reason enough to have it surgically altered, not counting dysphoria. \n\nAnd no; i actually cant be under the influence of mental incapacity when i elect for SRS. Why? Because i have to visit a psychiatrist who had to assess that i am under no mental duress that prevents me from thinking clearly about the decision and preventing it from being an informed and rational medical choice. \n\nFour; Being transgender isnt a social experiment. \n\nNeither is gay. Or black. Or smart. Or allowing the infantry to mix with the non apes or whatever. Let's put it this way; if trans people can use the bathroom of their choice, there won't need to be excessive bathroom schemes - again; most trans people are downright terrified of cis people.

Her study found only that trans people who transition *prior to 1989* had slightly higher rates of suicide attempts than the general public (but still far lower than pre-transition levels), and that trans people post-transition have slightly higher rates of needing mental health services. The study specifically identified abuse and discrimination as the cause of these differences.\n\nSince the interview in which she spelled out why these misrepresentations of her work are wrong is from The TransAdvocate, I've seen people claim the source isn't valid and the interview is fraudulent. I look forward to linking to a reddit AMA thread to show why this bullshit is wrong in the future.\n\nShe is also the primary author of [**another study**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262734734_An_Analysis_of_All_Applications_for_Sex_Reassignment_Surgery_in_Sweden_1960-2010_Prevalence_Incidence_and_Regrets) from 2014, which looked at \"regret\" rates among trans patients over a 50 year period, and (predictably) found that they were in the low single-digits and falling.\n\nThe Trans Health AMA week on /r/science has been pretty fantastic.

Both our parents would never properly accept him, and he's still got 2 years of high school left. The upside is he's got ridiculous good grades (over 4.0 gpa) so no worries on getting a scholarship, but until he can leave their house and finally live everyday as himself, he has to pretty much hide it under threat of being kicked out and completely shitflamed.

He's neither religious (came out to me as nonmuslim before) and also trans! Ah!! They would go ballistic.

About half way through third grade, those feelings began to fade as I developed a friendship with a very girly girl, but something was always in the back of my mind. At the end of fifth grade, I found out what trans was, but though nothing of it, but a few months later I got instagram and educated myself a lot more. \"I'm definitely trans\" was all I could think about, as puberty was beginning too, I started hating my body. I was having feelings of depression because of my breasts, and high voice but more importantly how the world saw me as a girl. I hated that!! I told a few friends, and accidentally told my mom and I was ready to get my hair cut but then the feelings changed a bit and I held off. They started to fade, again!! I was really embarrassed that I had told my mom and friends so I had to explain how I guess it was a \"phase\". Yet, I still couldn't shake it. For all of grade seven, it was still there, but very distant, the feeling of something not being right. But here I am again, beginning to feel the same way again, but stronger this time. I don't hate being a girl, it's just not right, but when I see boys, it does feel right. I imagine myself in a gay relationship and it makes me really really happy because I can see myself as that.

If men want to become women, is it just so that they get the breasts/cooch?

I don't really care for stereotypes and gender norms, and it is my assumption that as trans people, you all probably don't really care what society thinks as a whole in relation to it either. So if it isn't the acting/filling a predefined role (cause mate it's 2017, nobody really cares are this point), I've come to the conclusion that it must be looks/physical. \n\nI hear stories of people saying that they've felt like the opposite gender since they were a kid cause they wanted to do 'boy stuff' or wear dresses... but again, I see this as a societal thing, so if we erase that.... how does the whole trans thing fit in?\n\nI'm just curious and would like to understand a bit better.

I apologize in advance for making this long and expositionary, but right now the internet might be my only hope for relief.\n\nI came out to myself as ftm in January of this year. Reddit helped me a lot in terms of information and accepting myself, and the community over at /r/transforthememories encouraged me to examine my own past and accept just how many flags I had overlooked. My family isn't supportive, and many of my friends have been slow to start using he pronouns, using my \"new\" name, etc. I almost made a Facebook post about it today, but it feels kind of silly to make a fuss about something as personal as identity. It didnt seem like the right platform.\n\nIn March, I began to experience delusional thinking and paranoia. I was hospitalized twice, broke off my engagement, moved back in with my parents, and generally self isolated. I fell into deeper depression, turned to alcohol, dated my best friend because he was the only person I considered \"safe\", and would drive around for hours in a manic state looking for answers to questions I wasn't sure of. I am currently on Zyprexa and seeing a therapist.\n\nThis year has been a huge step forward for my identity, but shit in every other department. My delusions are less frequent now, but to some degree I believe they began as a result of the Trump presidency. I felt targetted. I didn't feel safe anywhere. And I certainly don't have an excess of people who understood where I was coming from as a transgender individual, even from psychological professionals.\n\nSo here I am, Reddit. I don't know where my body dysphoria and transness begins and the schizophrenia ends.. or vice versa. Does anyone have any information regarding a correlation between the two?  I am lost. Some times its hard to feel like suicide is not an eventuality. I don't know if I know how to become the person I was born to be.\n\nAny advice or resources you can provide would be stellar.

Without telling anyone, I started identifying as a woman who likes women, born in a mans body but really perfectly fine with it...happy even).\n\nLife has always felt too unnecessarily complex, on so many levels, but I'm 35 and for the first time ever I actually feel love (Its quite good). And  for the first time ever I feel human.\n\nIt's a relief to me that I found a home so to speak. That I don't have to worry about attempting the classical straight relationships anymore.\n\n I find that straight people are so overly complicated. Both cis men and cis women.

I always wanted to be a girl in the bedroom with a guy. Guy on guy never turned me on because I could never picture myself as a guy. \n\nThere is one strong sign of gender dysphoria that has been present since age 4: I have always been convinced that my thoughts and feelings are the thoughts and feelings of the opposite sex and I have always been convinced that what I felt is what the opposite sex feels. \n\nAnother potential sign of strong gender dysphoria: I dream of taking a karyotype test where they discover that I was born with female genetics ( intersex ). \n\nIn my mind and when reading a book or watching  television series I always identified with characters of the opposite sex. \n\nThe conviction that I have the soul of a woman in a male body has always been present. \n\nAs long as I can remember I felt negative or indifferent towards my penis. When I started watching transgender porn I never liked that the trans girl her penis was showing. I always look for videos where her penis is hidden. As soon as her penis pops up I feel alienated from her. I also don't like letting sexual partners play with my genitalia, I would even cry if someone touched them.\n\nCrossdreaming has occured since as long as I can remember. Dreaming of being the opposite sex in everyday situations etc...\n\nI am very offended by homophobia though. I don't know why. Sometimes I wonder if I could be a gay male myself and just be deeply in denial. There are a few things that contradict this: I can't portray myself as a man with another man. It doesn't arouse me and I can't relate whereas with woman plus man I get aroused and feel recognition instantly. \n\nI don't know if this can be considered dysphoria but facial hair and body hair freak me out. So does having a male body odor because I prefer smelling feminine. \n\nI internalized a lot of mysogynistic views. I don't want to socially transition because I can have a better career as a man, easier time expressing my opinion etc...\n\nI'm very scared to grow old as a male. I could accept growing old as a woman. \n\nI can't shake the thought that I might be a gay male deeply in denial. \n\nI saw a general physician who prescribed me hormones.\n\nGood and bad sides of hormone replacement therapy:\n\n- I like having soft skin\n- I like smelling feminine\n- I love having softened facial features\n- I enjoy the feminine sex drive and orgasms more\n\nBad:\n\n- I have anxiety attacks since I started HRT\n- My breasts have grown too big for my comfort. I like them but I wish they were smaller\n- I don't have a lot of energy \n- I have gotten my first episode of dissociation since HRT\n\nGood sides of stopping hormones:\n\n- My life wasn't too bad before I embarked on this journey. I just didn't like having a male appearence. If I stopped HRT I would probably go back to a moderate life with a nagging feeling. Especially now that I tasted femininity.\n- The anxiety attacks might stop\n- I don't know if the dissociation would stop but it might.\n\nBad sides of stopping hormones:\n\n- I like my appearence and I would be sad if my facial features sharpened again.\n- I would hate morning wood coming back\n- There would always be a strong envy towards people with a feminine appearence.\n- I would hate if my thought pattern became more masculine again.\n- I wouldn't like growing old as a man.\n- I feel envy of poster child trans women.\n\n\nSomething strange that could point towards gender dysphoria:\n\n- I secretely wish that I found signs that pointed to me being trans. Not sure if that means something?\n\n\nI keep wondering if I'm transitioning to be the woman in a heterosexual relationship, I can't shake the thought that I'm transitioning driven by a sexual force.\n\nIf I found out that I wasn't trans I would be crushed because my whole life I have been convinced that I was feeling like a girl and the desire to be a girl has always been there. Reading articles that suggest that I might be a cis male end in anxiety attacks: I just can't imagine myself as a male. \n\nI'm just scared because I read everywhere that if your brain sex is male and you take MtF HRT you will get all kinds of negative side effects on your mind. I don't like to read stuff like that because it feels invalidating and the thought that I might not be trans horrifies me.\n\n\n\n\n", "date": "2017-09-12 21:53:41", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/6zq8t1/what_if_i_am_a_gay_man_deeply_in_denial_trigger/", "author": "LifeIsSoHardForMe"}, {"title": "Help some grad students with their research and take our survey!

Strangely enough, my father in his 20s used to cross dress as a way to distance himself from the trauma he had experienced with his mother, and my mother has never really had strong feminine feelings either. My mother wore what was practical, over what was cute, and I was told that what I wanted didn't matter. So I never really developed a style. I just kind of did what I was told.\n\nAt 12, I hit puberty hard, and  I didn't want to wear bras, I didn't want to learn how to shave my legs and underarms. It just felt like I didn't need to. Like I wasn't supposed to. My mother never took the effort to teach us makeup, or how to be lady like. My father in his own depression and suppression of his trauma started hitting me.\n\nAt 15 I had my first feelings for a girl. She was straight, and didn't like me, but I treated her like my girlfriend anyway, and pretended I was in a cis relationship in the back of my head, even if I couldn't admit my own feelings for her. I knew the other girls in my class thought we were a gay couple, based on the way we acted, her sitting on my lap sometimes, and how I would jokingly call her my wife. Ultimately I think she was bi in denial as her parents were staunchly mormon, and being gay was a sin, and she told me we couldn't do those things anymore.\n\nAt 16 I met my current boyfriend of 3 years. At that point, had started questioning my gender, due to the religious compulsion I had to watch people like Ty turner, or chase. I watched transition video after transition video. I was beginning to wonder \"Do I identify with this? Or am I just fascinated with these people?\" \n\nAt 17 I decided I was Nonbinary, in hopes that I could still half ass identify as a girl, and be more masculine. I started buying men's clothes. My bf was more than accepting... but I knew he was straight and transitioning would be a bad idea.\n\nNow at 18, I am sitting in my bathtub... staring at my body, and trying to convince myself once again, that I am not a guy. That I'm not supposed to hate my chest, and that my hips are actually something to be desired. I'm trying to convince myself that I'm not feeling dysphoria, even as I am sitting here, loathing the way my body looks.\n\nI keep telling myself it's my parents fault. My parents just didn't teach me how to be a girl, or tried to force me into a rigid stereotype of a girl later, because wearing men's clothes wasn't cool. But I want to be a dude. Maybe it's because I was abused. I want to be a man because I won't feel as weak... No, it's because I have an outsider complex, and have never really felt like I fit. It's me trying to fit somewhere, and just grasping at straws... I'm just bi, and that part I was playing with that girl wasn't because I felt more comfortable being a man in my relationship, I'm just a butch bi girl. So many excuses. I couldn't transition because I love this guy, and hes straight. He would stop loving me. So many reasons I am like this but I shouldn't transition...\n\nI know the truth. I know I'm a man... I just can't accept it.\n\n", "date": "2017-09-17 22:56:02", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/70qwwo/im_still_here_in_denial/", "author": "CaseyCashew"}, {"title": "a confused boy /maybe/", "text": "Hello!!

I was never really feminine either though, and i've kept a decent air of androgynous about me personality and behavorially. I've never been afraid to have my nails painted or similar.\n\nI think it started when I began dating my trans boyfriend, he opened me up to his world. I always had this strange feeling in my gut when it was talked about. Nothing bad, but I was always a bit envious. Being as out as he was about it, I strangely felt... envious of what I thought was his bravery, but I'm not so sure if it was specifically that. Even talking about it is making butterflies appear in my stomach. I was strangely quick to use the correct pronouns and always be respectful of when he was feeling particularly dysphoric, but I had never had really met a trans person before then. Whereas I think most cis folk would struggle for a couple of weeks.\n\nAnyways, as the relationship wound up, I occasionally passed tumblr posts about being trans and youtube vids talking about it, and I got that same feeling. I can't even describe it wholy as envy, it feels like so much more.\n\nAfter seeing some trans timelines of trans girls, I think I feel want. Being feminine seems so nice, I feel like it'd fit me more than my masc/androg self at least, however I don't feel any dysphoria I don't think. I like the idea of keeping my genitals the same, but breasts I am completely fine with as well. \n\nI feel like I am rambling at this point, and this is probably as in-depth as I can really make it. Do you think I might be trans, or just too appreciative of a feminine form?\n\nI'm not sure if i'd be ready at all to come out as such, even though my fathers been very accepting of my bisexuality and i'm sure would be cool with me being a girl, but I just don't have the backbone like my ex-boyfriend. Even in the face of people who'd call him \"her\" and his dead name, he'd clench his fists and bear it.  Even imagining the slightly disconcerted look of my mostly-approving father and/or coworkers after coming out is enough to make me second-guess it all I think.\n\nThe thing is, I seem to see most trans people are very \"I knew I was like this since I was little! I'd put on X clothes and joke around with friends that I was X\" but I never had anything like that. tbh I don't really feel like I have a definitive personality, and maybe I'm attracted to this prospect mostly because it'd make me less of a boring two-dimensional person? I'm sure I'd be fine with remaining a male the rest of my life, but that question will always nag me to the end.\n\nOkay, I need to stop or else this'll be longer than a novel.

Hey AJ, those are just your initials, I don\u2019t want to post your name. Hopefully I\u2019ll post enough clues to make sure no one mistakes themselves for the recipient and starts to panic! But hey. I\u2019ve known you for quite a few years and I feel like through those years I\u2019ve become close to you as a friend and have begun to understand who you are. You\u2019re definitely pretty enigmatic so sometimes it\u2019s hard to tell certain things but you\u2019re also a wizard at dropping hints towards things you want people to notice about you. Hey I know you\u2019re transgender, at least 99% sure.. I\u2019ve known for maybe I\u2019d say years? At least a year definitely. Just want to say hey I\u2019m still around, I don\u2019t think differently of you at all, to me you\u2019re still just my friend AJ. Like I\u2019ve said as time went on our friendship I feel has only strengthened. Through every new experience we go through together it\u2019s always adventure and laughs and interesting conversations. I think you get the point, I\u2019m here and I\u2019m not going anywhere. That being said I\u2019m not pushing you, I\u2019m not using your name, I\u2019m not trying to threaten your way of life or make you uncomfortable but I am offering a hand, a chance to come out to someone who understands if that\u2019s what you truly want. A chance. And it\u2019s not a time sensitive offer either! If you want to wait that\u2019s perfectly okay! But if you EVER feel like you want to take a pretty significant step and tell someone who you are I\u2019m here! I know what you\u2019re thinking, but you don\u2019t want to come to me and say it outright, that\u2019s too scary. I don\u2019t blame you, I wouldn\u2019t either. Send hinting texts! Tell me some strange fact about the African Botfly who knows! I know I seem to be taking this lightly but it\u2019s plenty serious to me, plenty of people feel isolated and left in the dark for fear of the judgement they\u2019d receive, it\u2019s a scary place out there and it\u2019s a scary place in your mind alone. I wonder how many times a friend simply reaching out could\u2019ve helped and even saved people. There are people out there who love you and will respect you as they do now, you don\u2019t have to reach out but remember that if you do it\u2019ll all be okay in the end, you\u2019re not alone! You don\u2019t have to tell someone in your life either, tell this reddit! We love you! I hope my vagueness towards either end didn\u2019t force you to come out through exposure and I also hope no one else thought they were AJ. Left some hints! I hope my friend sees this and finally questions whether they are or aren\u2019t in this alone, that they could come out to someone if they wanted. Or at least casually drop some facts about some botflies.. it takes strength to live in a time where people push you down for being you, takes resilience to stand through it all, it takes a friend. No one\u2019s asking anyone to do anything alone. We\u2019re all here on this reddit or otherwise to help :)\n\n(If I said anything wrong or hurtful please let me know and I\u2019ll work to do better, last thing I want is to hurt anyone or to make anyone uncomfortable, especially my friend)", "date": "2017-10-11 11:40:19", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/75oheu/message_to_my_friend_who_im_pretty_sure_browses/", "author": "helpingtiedye"}, {"title": "I'm coming out today.

My heart leapt again, just like when I wore women's boots or a women's shirt. I didn't go anywhere, I just stayed downstairs with my parents and brothers.\n\nToday, I did the same. Admittedly rather poorly this time, I rushed myself since everyone was home this time. I sat upstairs alone, but happy enough, wearing a pair of the dumbest socks I own. (A pair of black knee highs with two right leg bones outlined in white thread)\n\nUsually i take them off before leaving my room, even for a short time.

My parents are laughing, my mom playfully smacking my dad on the leg while he grins. Out of nowhere i say, \"is this supposed to be erotic?\"\n\nI don;t know why! I just...said it. then my dad turned to me still grinning. \n\n\"maybe when you're older.\" \n\nI'm 18 goddamnit. If this would've been something i could just leave in my past, I wouldn't be depressed for five goddamn years.\n\nI left the room and went upstairs.

OK?\" Girl, thank you for giving me a heads up, I know you gotta do your job and you want to protect my privacy as much as you can. She flags someone down and tells them very very quietly. I hear snatches of \"now I believe that she is this person here, but the computer might not...\" and \"Yes, without a doubt!\" And lady #2 nods and walks away, looking shocked.\n\nLady #1 And I chat for another few minutes before getting down to business: checking my eyes and the new photo.

She even offered to let me put on the makeup I keep in my purse, despite it not being technically allowed for people with that tiny M on their DL \ud83d\ude12 I think about it, but decline because I know my hands are shaking too badly for me to properly put on eyeliner, but it's the thought that counts.\n\nAfter my picture (where I'm giving my best lesbian smirk. Hey, she was pretty damn cute!) I noticed that lady #2 is whispering to another person a few cubicles over (did I mention I'm paranoid?) And I catch her point at me, and I made eye contact with both of them, causing them to duck down or walk away quickly. Fuck, I'm now llama food at the DMV. I tune back into the conversation with lady #1, trying to pretend like that didn't just happen. She starts saying, again, how great I look and \"OMG it says you gained 35 lbs since the last time you were here. Girl, I can't believe that!\" It's all gone to my hips, thighs, ass, and boobs.

So having that much positive attention was intoxicating.\n\nBut the more I talked to these guys the more frustrated I became.

Not only that, I had multiple guys tell me I was a bitch (or something worse) because I disagreed with them. One guy actually threatened to kill me if I called him by the wrong name, which I hadn't even done. These conversations got so dark so quickly it was frustrating and disturbing. Of the good ones, maybe about half of them asked me out in the first 24 hours. I'm the type of girl who likes to talk for a few weeks first. \n\nAll this happened when they thought I was a cis-woman.

This may more just be a sort of self-therapy and getting stuff out there, but here goes.\n\nSo I am a 21 year old person. I was born male. When I was a little kid I liked to dress up in my mums coats and shoes, which she knew about and didn't really make much of. Then when puberty hit I got more interested in wearing my mums bras and knickers, and tights and swimsuits etc. She never once caught me. The arousal was both sexual and \"inside me\" (whatever that meant). I used to wear my mums bras to sleep and be super paranoid she would walk in and see the straps, I once even wore them under my normal clothes but soon took it off. I used to wish so bad that I would wake up and just be a girl- I even used to pray to God (Allah in this case as I was brought up a Muslim).\n\nThroughout secondary school I mainly had guy friend, but I never felt I was one of them if I'm being perfectly honest. I was always interested in what the girls were doing, and was super jealous of the guys that used to hang around them. I was a quite a shy and dorky kid, so I didn't have the guts to go and make friends.\n\nThen I went to a sixth form that was further away from my home and met lots of different people from all over the area. I started becoming friends with more people. I realised I liked being friends with girls as opposed to guys. This may have had something to do with liking a lot of them. Even though I had guy friends, I still was never really close to them. All this while I was jealous of what I see some of the girls wearing, thinking to myself \"That looks so stunning, I wish I had that frame and body and that gender, why couldn't I just be born a girl\". Now my mums not the most religious person, but she's fairly religious and something like this would definitely have been dismissed. Also I didn't want to disappoint her, Im an only child-straight A student. I wanted to make her proud. The cross dressing still happened, but this time I wore a lot of her clothes and tried on her makeup (very badly- might I add). I think I'm such a freak. I have a cross dressing fetish. I am a freak of nature.\n\nRoll around to university and I'm out there on my own independent of my parents. I decide to do a little shopping and buy some Ann Summers lingerie and some other sex toys from love honey etc. Everytime I did this I purged the whole lot, saying I need to be a man and every time I purged I binge bought the whole load of it again. This happened twice in first year of university, three times in second year, twice in third year and its happened twice already in my fourth year. I've obviously spent a lot of money on this. I think I still considered it a fetish. Whilst I was at uni I under dressed in bras and knickers all the time, usually hiding it with loose fitting clothes, and jumpers/ coats.\n\nNow I was diagnosed with depression and bulimia in July 2017. I'm currently on medication for the depression and am getting therapy with both the depression and bulimia. I've not mentioned any of this to my GP/ therapist because I still believed it was a fetish. Before my last purge I went full whack, and bought a wig, nail polish, clothes from online and even went shopping in person to buy women clothes from primark etc. It was then that I discovered when I was wearing the clothes and the wig and the makeup (again applied poorly) I felt happy-happier than I had been for a long time. I was also doing these things and I wasn't getting turned all the time. I just enjoyed the feeling of wearing female clothing.\n\nDuring this past year as well as the cross dressing I also purchased a breast pump (to try and increase the size of my breasts) and self medication for oestrogen hormones. Used them for a while then binned the whole lot as I didn't want my doctor seeing anything funny from blood tests I was having done linked to the bulimia. I considered before my last purge, maybe i'm transgender. I wasn't sure, I knew I was at least somewhere on the spectrum that was not cis male. I lasted all of 4 weeks before I went ahead and bought some more female clothes, spending a tonne of money on this stuff- again!\n\nI have been seriously considering telling my GP. But I don't know how to/ what will happen. I've imagined coming out to my housemates and mum. But theres so many things my mum does not know about, that I don't want to overwhelm her and I still don't want to disappoint her. Im scared my housemates will reject me and tell me that I'm just a sexual fiend or something. But more and more i'm tucking and wearing knickers and a bra. I bought my first proper pair of female high wasted jeans. I wear on my hips whilst in guy mode but pull them up to my waist when I have a t shirt that will cover up the high waist.\nI don't think I've \"let on\" to anyone that Im having gender dysphoria. I just don't know what to do.\n\nThank you for reading and I'm really sorry for the long post\n\nEdit: added paragraph spacing", "date": "2017-10-15 22:13:47", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/76m494/repost_from_rtransgenderuki_am_very_confusedmtf/", "author": "nabs96"}, {"title": "This picture of my brother's wedding last Saturday makes me cringe so hard, I didn't realize I look that terrible.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-10-16 03:24:59", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/76nudh/this_picture_of_my_brothers_wedding_last_saturday/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "My brother's wedding, with my other brother and sister in law, feeling very nonpassing seeing this pic.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-10-16 03:38:08", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/76nwv8/my_brothers_wedding_with_my_other_brother_and/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Me with my brothers and new sisters.", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-10-16 03:41:56", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/76nxl7/me_with_my_brothers_and_new_sisters/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Questions for trans women", "text": "So I am a writer and I am making the main character of my story a post-op trans woman.

Why go through an embarrissing transition only to end up as a trans lesbian? You get made fun of, get insulted and hurt only so that straight girls are not into you anymore and lesbians still see you as not female. That sounds pretty stupid. Also my dad is pretty homo- and transphobic. \nSo i tried to be a dude. I even had a girlfriend for some time. I did ok in school. Had some friends. Started work. So far so good. I was not 100% happy but i was doing ok. I thought i could live like that. And it might have worked i think.\nSadly at some point my girlfriend left me. She was cheating on me anyway and i was always forgiving her just to keep her. How stupid i am.\nThis was roughly 13 years ago. I never found a new girl. Most of my friends have families by now and we lost contact. There's one good friend left that i talk to around once a week but he knows nothing about my female feelings.

My gender questioning has taken a hardcore uptick in the last month because I got a binder for myself- after three years of debate with my trans partner- and I put it on and just bawled. I looked in the mirror and for the first time since middle school I didn't hate my body. I thought I would just wear it around the house to see how I felt, but I've been having to remind myself every day that it's unhealthy to wear it more than eight hours and I *have* to take it off now. My friends took me shopping for masc clothing and I was able to shop without a panic attack. In fact, since I've started wearing it my social anxiety has basically dropped to nothing. I can dress for dates with my partner and not cry because nothing I own looks right or good enough, I wear more than sweatpants and baggy shirts, and I even have a better relationship with my jiggly tummy (I realized recently I'd been interpreting my womanly curves and breasts as just extra fat-bags on my chest and I felt horrible with them). \n\nSo my main problem with my internal debate is that I don't know where I draw the line between just being pleased that I can achieve the \"butch aesthetic\" which I've always desired in one way or another, or if I need to do some more searching, and if so, down what avenue. \n\n(tmi?) I've felt before that I've had a \"lack\" of a penis, mostly when sleeping with women and I'd just make up for it by placing my fingers in front of my pelvis, and until my current relationship I've always been a pure top because it never felt... Right? Having other people touch me like that? But these are all things that could just be like super uuber butch feelings. \n\nSo that's my question to others- I live in a trans house but not with any other lesbian identified AFABs so I'm asking you, dear internet- I'm wondering if anyone who is in that identity/considered it before can chat with me a bit about how you drew the line between them because gender is messy and confusing, and a butch identity allows for so much masculinity!\n\nFeel free to dm me &lt;3 \nThanks y'all", "date": "2017-10-22 15:59:44", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7810bp/where_do_you_draw_lines_between_butch_woman_v/", "author": "Brigelbee"}, {"title": "you may be normal, but that\u2019s your problem, not mine\u2026", "text": "", "date": "2017-10-22 21:50:40", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7838ng/you_may_be_normal_but_thats_your_problem_not_mine/", "author": "birdyfullmoon"}, {"title": "Im trans and i need conclusive proof on medical transitioning (EXTREMELY URGENT)", "text": "I'm a wreck\n\nI found a study by ARIF (google ARIF trans) that says the studies on medical transitioning areflawe and that there is no evidence for transitioning being clinically proven.

Get yourself a self care pack. You can do this irl, but on your phone too. If you want to do this in real life, then gather stuff that would comfort you, when your gender dysphoria kicks in. For example, write nice messages on pieces of paper, and put them in a jar, or bottle or whatever you feel like. And when you feel bad, just get a random one out, read it, and then put it back, and mix the jar/bottle/whatever up again. Also, having lots of blankets, movies, youtube or netflix nearby is a pretty neat solution too. Now hurrs the kicker. How do you do it on your phone? Well, for example, download cute games, put them into a folder called \"Self care\" or \"You are valid\" or something like that. Also, having a playlist of comforting videos, and songs helps too. And friends are always there, so don't hesitate to reach out to them!\n\n                   \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 \u2218\u2715\u10e6\u2715\u2218 \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nWelp this is pretty much it.

I wouldn't say \"effeminate\" is definitely the right word, but loud, boisterous, (I like to think) kind and sensitive. Fashionable (again, I like to think) artistic, not athletic at all, and until a few years ago, pretty overweight.\n\nI thought my body/gender issues were a weight problem and\u2014while that certainly didn't help matters\u2014I've lost a lot of weight over the last 5 years, and have been in pretty good shape for the past 3. The first year of weight loss, I was doing great and was super confident, etc. but after a while it wore off. I've been very depressed the last couple of years, and have had a pretty bleak outlook, but have managed to suppress anything bad, and have just sort of coasted through life, always feeling like something is off.\n\nI thought for the last year or so that perhaps I was gay, and that's been a pretty pressing thought in my mind, but I've never been sure, and It never felt super good to identify that way, and imagining myself in a relationship with a cis-guy didn't really feel super great. I talked to a few friends about this, but haven't really acted on it.\n\nAbout a week ago, it donned on me that maybe I'm trans, and it really was like the sky opened up and I just sort of had this \"HOLY. SHIT.\" Moment. I was shopping online and typed in \"sweatpants\" and was taken to the women's section of the website by chance (or fate maybe, jk don't believe in fate). I was all like \"well there's no real difference in women's sweatpants than men's, and they were cheaper, so I was browsing and I looked at this female supermodel and I just thought \"fuck, I want to be you.\" And it was like one of the biggest \"AHA!\" Moments I've had. \n\nI've been looking into it, and heard about the magic Button test and I feel like I'd do that in a heartbeat, but the magic button doesn't exist.\n\nI've looked through some subreddits and have seen people transitioning and am terrified to think that I would be in a phase where I'm presenting, but not passing at all. I mean NO disrespect when I say that AT ALL, and I realize that's 100% a personal problem. I'm just such a self conscious person, that I feel like I would feel worse about my looks if I were in that stage than I do now.\n\nThat being said, I've tried being a little more effeminate in my presentation/mannerism the last week, and I haven't been in such a good mood in years. I've felt very very confident and comfortable, and the idea of one day presenting full female actually sounds really great! \n\nBut so many of my gender issues, I feel, stem from trying to be a guy in a world where a guy has to be ABC, and being criticized for not being that. I'm afraid that transitioning may be even worse for me in that regard.\n\nI'm also afraid of me thinking this is something helpful to do now but then the depression will just come right back and I'll realize that's not the right choice and wasn't the root of it at all. I wish we lived in a world where everyone was free to just slide around the gender scale as they saw fit; to dip their toes in the water, if you will. But we don't and I'm afraid of both trying and not having it help, and also of not trying at all. \n\nAlso very afraid of my parents/family reaction, I think my parents would be cool but maybe not, I have no idea.\n\nLastly I was looking up gender-based subreddits and saw \"gender critical\" and that scared the shit out of me and made me feel horrible and afraid as well. \n\nTL;DR: I'm afraid. \n\nAnyways, and help or advice or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

At this time in my life my abusive mother (was in foster care, have had three abusive mothers) cut off my hair as a punishment and people started to mistake me for a boy. I was elated. At this point I started having people call me by a more masculine version of my current name. When people pointed out \"but that's a boys name!\" it made happy. \nBut I didn't identify as trans or a boy, I just wished I were one and was happy when people mistook me for one.\n\nWhen I was a little older I said it was so that I could date girls without being judged .\n\n\nthen I was sexually abused for 9 months and I told myself it was because I wanted to be big and strong and able to defend myself. I had an eating disorder, I hated my body, and I kept telling myself that I don't like dressing like a girl because I'm just not comfortable with my body and once the eating disorder was better I'd be more comfortable. The eating disorder got better, I came out as gay, I started dating girls and it just didn't go away.\nI was explaining all this to my girlfriend one night, while a bit loopy on sleeping meds, and how if I could just sew up my lady bits I'd be so much happier because I get nothing from them existing, and that I hate having to buy clothes that accommodate my breasts, and I just hate being so short and weak and she said... \"are you maybe trans?\" That was the first time I'd ever considered that it was anything other than a bunch of separate reasons.\nFrom there, I tried dressing \"like a man\" and suddenly I realized that the reason I felt so uncomfortable in dresses and skirts wasn't that I hated my body, it was the clothes I was wearing. what seemed to be depression- wearing sweatpants and tshirts under coats everywhere all the time - went away and suddenly I cared about dressing nicely every day as long as I didn't have to wear feminine clothing. I didn't despise and feel awkward wearing makeup because I was self hating and lazy I just hated make up- and that was ok. I got all my hair cut off, as my mom had done except not a hack job- loved it. I started wearing super tight sports bras and that got rid of a lot of anxiety for me. The other day someone mistook me for a man and called me sir and it made my entire day. All day I was confident. \n\n\nNSFW:\nand then, there's the sexual aspect. I don't enjoy sex partially from trauma and partially because I hate my body, and don't want anyone interacting with my \"lady bits.\" I'll do things to women and enjoy that. I get \"turned on,\" Im not asexual. After doing something for someone else, I would jill off imagining I was a dude in the scenario and get off that way.

Any advice?", "text": "Hi! I'm new here in reddit but I badly need some advice. I already talked to few friends but they have different opinions on my issue and I was hoping to hear more from you guys. Even if we don't know each other personally, I am very much willing to listen.\n\nSo here goes.. \n\nI'm a 26 y/o female from the Philippines who is in a 5 yr (turning 6 on Feb) relationship with a transman   who is also from the Philippines. I came from a quite religious old traditioned  and conservative family because my parents grew up in the province. When I was in my teenage years, I started dating boys but my parents were against it. In the Philippines, parents can be very strict. When I was in my last year in college i met a lesbian who is now my boyfriend (currently transitioning to transman) To be honest I never imagined myself being in a same sex relationship. I was all about boys then. I didn't enter this relationship because I got my heart broken with by guy, no. It just felt right. My parents knew about it and they got mad with the cursing and all and it just hurts so bad that they judge the person just because he's a transman. They are so disgusted they have so many comments about it! They are really against this whole same sex relationship because they say nothing good comes out of it. That I am destroying my future because I am inlove with him. (For the record they don't know the different between lesbians and trans) That God didn't make gays and lesbians only man and woman and all that shit that homophobic people say. So from then on I just told them we broke up just to shut them up, so no more issues. Then I moved out of the country with my boyfriend. \n\nFast forward to 5 yrs, we are happily living together BUT still without the knowledge of my parents. I have been keeping it from them for years because I wanted to protect him from all the hurtful words my parents will say to him. My relationship with my boyfriend has matured that now we are thinking of a future, our own family together. It has been bothering me for days if now is the right time to tell them everything. Of course I am so scared of what might happen after. And i am pretty much sure they would want me to choose: them or my boyfriend. I never wanted that to happen because he is my family now, \n\nWhat do I have to do for them to accept me? Us? I wanted to prove to them that he has never put me in any danger and that my future with him is as bright as sunshine. Because i think for them having my own children and having their own grand children is like the greatest achievement. Ok I want that too but with him, and when I am totally ready. I have found my soulmate, the love of my life but why do i feel like my own parents want me to be unhappy and be with someone that I don't love. I don't know anymore.

Have you taken Lamictal?", "text": "I've recently been covering depersonalization disorder - persistent feelings that the world is unreal or colorless, that you don't really feel your emotions, that you just watch yourself robotically going through the motions of life. I've previously called this \"indirect gender dysphoria\". This is a dissociative symptom that's difficult to describe, but it's linked to significant mental health difficulties including depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Depersonalization may also be up to 18 times more common in trans people - frequent enough that it may be considered an understudied aspect of the experience of gender dysphoria. See more about this research here: https://genderanalysis.net/depersonalization/\n\nIn my discussions with psychiatrists who specialize in neurochemistry, we've found that depersonalization symptoms are likely linked to the NMDA receptor and are often treated experimentally with Lamictal (which is also used to counteract the dissociative NMDA antagonist drug ketamine), with some promising results. Estrogen also appears to act on NMDA and seems a likely candidate for the neurochemical basis of the marked and rapid effect of HRT on mitigating dissociative symptoms. If this is the case, then we would have reason to investigate the possibility that Lamictal could serve as an add-on treatment to HRT when significant mental health difficulties are still present.\n\nIf you're interested in participating, I'd like to hear your answers to the following questions in as much detail as possible: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EcmhV1-qn3RZyT-m0RBQq1cFN6e_ZGSNWkSxOoBlCEU/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nYou can PM me or send responses to zjemptv@gmail.com.

I help her with her make up and outfits and nails. We've bought wigs and padding and shoes and sex toys to help her feel as womanly as possible when we have the opportunity to let her be herself. It can be hard because we have tenants that share our property.\n\nShe's gone online to try and find friends who might accept her as her real self but a lot of people online see her solely as a cross dresser and treat her like she's a fetish or a sex doll. What she really wants are friends who understand her and support her and will keep her secret \n\nIt can be hard here in the LGBTQ community because it is such a small place... once one person joins the community is spreads like wildfire.

I am currently 21, assigned male at birth.\n\nI come from a pretty conservative family, so I got very used to blocking out feelings that would be inconvenient for me to have at a young age. That's why I've only been able to admit to my bisexuality a year ago. But once I admitted that, some other feelings started to come up. I started looking in the mirror and wishing my hips were wider, I started getting increasingly annoyed at my body hair, my coarse skin, my wide shoulders. If I ever let myself grow facial hair, I get very depressed. I am extremely conscious of my vocal inflection, how low my voice is, how big my hands and feet are, how giant my Adam's apple is. I started looking up ways to dress and exercise to make my shoulders look thinner and my hips look wider, I shave pretty much my entire body except my head, I pay more attention to my posture, I stole a skirt from my sister just to try on every once in a while, I bought panties that I wear under my pants just for comfort sometimes, I started plucking my eyebrows and using some light makeup to give myself a slightly thinner looking face and I'm not really sure why any of these things feel right, but they do. I started looking back on my life and noticing that I had wanted to do a lot of these things before and just hadn't because they were \"wrong\" or \"dirty\". I remember being made fun of for \"walking and talking like a girl\" when I was a little kid and I remember my parents yelling at me when I let my sisters do my makeup. I'm kinda shocked I blocked this stuff out by the time high school came around. \n\nOver the past year, I haven't wanted to label any of this. It's a big enough wrench in my life hiding my sexuality from my parents while they pay for most of my college. \n\nI recently started asking myself a bunch of hypothetical questions like, \"If you could turn your body into a girl's right now with no consequences, would you?\" and \"Would you want to be a girl all the time?\" and \"Would you be a girl if it meant losing most of your old friends?\" and \"What if you could change your sexual features at a moment's notice? How often would you change from a guy to a girl? Would you rather be something in the middle?\" I don't know the answer for sure to a lot of these questions, but I know I would not only be a guy if I had that kind of choice. \n\nI didn't want to address this for awhile, at least until I was independent and on my own. But I've been getting more and more depressive episodes lately, where I just can't get out of bed for 2 or 3 days at a time. I talked to a therapist but I haven't brought up anything beyond my sexuality. I'm afraid this gender stuff might be the reason I get so depressed, like this thing that makes me happy is going to destroy the life I've built and there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nI finally broke down and told my best friend about this. They told me if I was unsure whether I was a trans woman or nb or just a crossdresser, I should start reading and listening and talking to as many people with similar experiences as I could. \n\nAs much as I'd like someone to read this and say, \"Yep, you're definitely trans,\" or \"Nah, you're not trans,\" what I'm really asking for is if anyone here has similar experiences or if anyone has some good reading material I can look into with people's experiences on this stuff.  \n", "date": "2017-11-07 10:41:39", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7bce8l/questioning_my_gender_not_sure_about_labels/", "author": "Beaus-and-Eros"}, {"title": "a poem... a Transgender love lament in a Patriarchal world", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-11-07 15:58:10", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7be2ny/a_poem_a_transgender_love_lament_in_a_patriarchal/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "Danica Roem Will Be First Transgender Person Elected to State Legislature", "text": "", "date": "2017-11-08 01:54:37", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7bi3cj/danica_roem_will_be_first_transgender_person/", "author": "Calvin_the_Bold"}, {"title": "Three years HRT, One year on Two Wheels.", "text": "", "date": "2017-11-08 04:56:48", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7bj4m7/three_years_hrt_one_year_on_two_wheels/", "author": "SylvieP155"}, {"title": "GOP bloodied in historic off-year election; Trans woman wins VA statehouse seat", "text": "", "date": "2017-11-08 06:18:10", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7bjiwx/gop_bloodied_in_historic_offyear_election_trans/", "author": "pleasepeace2"}, {"title": "do any Chicago trans* People know a Trans friendly doctor that ISN'T at Howard Brown?", "text": "I've been at howard brown since 2009.

We thrifted up a tight babydoll tee a skort and a glittery beanie beneath which was a hastily fashioned ponytail. Complete with shaved legs and makeup we went out for date night.  We chose an Indian restaurant.  Here a series of events unfolded that were pretty cool in retrospect.  I ordered a glass of wine and when the server looked at my ID he said with a meticulous smile \"I cannot take this it is clearly your brothers identification\".  I was dumbfounded because I was pretty damn sure I didn't \"pass\", which meant this gracious bastard was going out of his way to be respectful to me and the gender I was clearly presenting. Additionally nobody in the restaurant gave us a second look when we entered or during dinner.  I smeared my lipstick on the naan.  That was the worst thing that happened.  Now maybe being 5' 11\" and 230 lbs at the time had something to do with the lack of harassment.  I can't say for sure.

The end kind of summarizes my point, but I can't condense it further. Sorry.\n\nI saw a Twitter post today that, while it clearly resonated with others, kind of terrifies me:\n\n\"...HRT does just as much (if not more) for [trans people] mentally as it does physically. We are not taking hormones merely to pass. We're taking them because there is a noticeable, measurable relief it gives our brains.\"\n\nSome of the replies included remarks like \"living before hrt felt like living under a heavy sheet of oppression,\" and I'm so, so glad for those people that they now feel comfortable. But I'm not sure I feel like that.\n\nI've always been good at ignoring my body's signals. I've stayed up days at I time because night came and I was too in the middle of something to sleep. I've gone all day without eating because I just plain didn't notice. I've let my feet fall completely asleep because I noticed the signal they were tingling and wasn't ready to move yet. I went years without noticing that the disgust when I saw my chest had nothing to with how my breasts looked and instead had to do with the fact that I had them.\n\nRealizing I was nonbinary awakened me to the regular dysphoria I'd already experienced and ignored. I didn't notice I was uncomfortable with one set of pronouns until I noticed I was more comfortable with another. I've rapidly come to discover that in addition to a flat chest, I craved facial hair, and a deeper voice. I craved androgyny.\n\nYears ago, I was in a very bad place. The stress of trying to pass high school with an undiagnosed disability and years of emotional abuse and neglect left me with depression and social anxiety I was self-harming to cope with. A year ago almost to the date, I took LSD with my partner and gained a new perspective on life that really helped me manage my anxiety, and in turn, I found ways to get over my depression. I haven't been in as bad a mental place since then, and I really don't intend to return.\n\nMy pronouns make me happy, but my body does not. I love myself and my appearance, I just wish with all my heart it was different, in ways that are most easily achieved through transition. But I'm not in a bad mental place. I'm out to almost everyone close to me, and accepted by everyone I've told. I'm very lucky I'm that regard. As much as I yearn for the physical changes testosterone would bring, I don't always feel trapped by estrogen.\n\nThere are days when I don't mind my feminine features as much. Days when I worry that facial hair would ruin my looks. *Then,* there are days when I don't even want to talk to myself, let alone others, because the pitch of my voice makes me want to curl up and die. Days when hearing service workers call me \"ma'am\" and \"miss\" turns my heart inside out. I'm just. Afraid, I guess.\n\nI'm not so much afraid of the effects of testosterone. I've asked myself over and over if the worst of the effects would be worth it, and the answer's come back yes every time. I'm just afraid that HRT won't be the panacea everyone makes it out to be. I'm afraid I've misinterpreted myself again, that even though I'm not a boy and I'm definitely not a girl, I'm not an androgyne either.\n\n...I'm afraid I'm not broken enough to need fixing.\n\nThe number of people who that tweet resonated with, who described it as taking a weight off their shoulders... I'm afraid it wouldn't do that for me. I don't know that it could because I don't know if such a weight exists. I only know the perspective I have now. Trying HRT and discovering that it doesn't make me any happier, or worse, that it actively makes me unhappy, would leave me confused and distraught and with an identity crisis the likes of which I've never faced.\n\nI need to do SOMETHING. I can't keep binding forever; eventually it's going to cause permanent damage to either my breasts (jeopardizing surgery) or my lungs (jeopardizing my singing) and I'd rather suffer daily dysphoria than deal with permanent pain, but really I'd rather not deal with it at all. Both HRT and top surgery are enormous undertakings that require total dedication though, and I can't be *that* certain until I have the perspective that doing one or the other brings more satisfaction than not.\n\nI guess I'm looking for advice. Or encouragement. Or just. A different perspective. Someone who's gone through something similar. I'm neither strong nor brave enough to pioneer my own journey. I need some help.

This can become a chronic syndrome, usually beginning in adolescence or sometimes earlier, and is highly distressing and associated with significantly elevated depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, and severe impairments in school, employment, and relationships. Transgender people are several times more likely than the general population to suffer depersonalization disorder, and studies have found that transitioning, specifically HRT, reduces these symptoms in both trans men and trans women. Many trans people broadly share this experience of living a \"deadened\" life before transition, then feeling \"alive\" for the first time, often in the first few weeks or months after starting - a profound experience that often helps affirm for us the rightness of our gender and our choice to transition, and enables us to have a more full and enjoyable life that we'd been deprived of before.\n\nDepersonalization disorder is notoriously difficult to treat among cis people, which makes the efficacy of transition an outlier. At the same time, some trans people continue to experience depersonalization after starting transition, and others may not be able to access transition treatments for various reasons. At least one study has speculated that these dissociative symptoms are so common that they may in fact be an inherent part of gender dysphoria itself. Treatment of this psychiatric symptom could be as beneficial to us as HRT is in relieving bodily dysphoria. For this reason, I've been investigating the potential role of add-on treatments that could help with this, starting from what's known about treatment of depersonalization disorder and what's known about the psychiatric effects of hormones.\n\nScience nerdiness ahead: Estrogen is known to enhance NMDA function, and is also used as an add-on treatment in schizophrenia (in which the glutamate system is now known to be heavily implicated). There's also an observed overlap between some of the \"anomalous self-experiences\" of depersonalization disorder and the negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia - emotional blunting, avolition, alogia, lack of spontaneity, and consequent severe difficulties with employment and life in general. Lamotrigine (Lamictal), an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer, is increasingly used as a key element of treatment of depersonalization disorder, and also modulates glutamate. Additionally, one major depersonalization researcher, Dr. Daphne Simeon, has received grants for trials of the NMDA glycine-site partial agonist D-cycloserine as an experimental treatment, and has recommended to patients that they supplement with the amino acid glycine in doses similar to that used in adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia (0.8g/kg/day, or on average about 60 grams a day). I've also spoken with a psychiatrist who suggested that D-serine and sarcosine (N-methylglycine), which are also used in add-on treatments of schizophrenia, could be used for depersonalization.\n\nI've been speaking with other doctors in the know about this kind of thing, and we have a sort of budding NMDA hypothesis of transgender depersonalization coming together here. It also has some notable shortcomings and contrary evidence. It does not seem to account for the experiences of trans men. Trans men and trans women appear to experience depersonalization at the same rate, and trans men experience the same decrease in symptoms after testosterone as trans women do after estrogen. In the general population, depersonalization disorder has a 1:1 gender ratio, and there's currently no indication of any pattern of estrogen having any kind of protective effect as seen in schizophrenia.\n\nQuite simply, I don't have the requisite background knowledge or experience to meaningfully account for this or tie this whole theory together any more neatly. But there seem to be the beginnings of something here, something that may usefully pan out into better treatment for at least some of us. So my questions are: Does anyone here know of anything that could hint toward a better understanding of how these various systems, symptoms, and treatments function together? Is there anything that, biochemically, accounts for the efficacy of testosterone in reducing these symptoms in trans men? (The HPA axis has also been marked as potentially involved in depersonalization symptoms, if that could be relevant.) And if there are any psychiatrists or other doctors with relevant expertise here, would you be willing to get in touch and look over the evidence base we've accumulated and offer your opinion of whether add-on treatment with these glycine modulators could be recommended for trans people with depersonalization?

The biggest difference observable by just sniffing, is that cis male BO smells more like stinky cheese, and cis female BO smells like sulphur and onions. The difference is caused by different proportions of compounds in the sweat, which affects which odor chemicals are produced by the bacteria metabolizing sweat. \n\nThe other component that people notice, possibly on a less conscious level, are some chemicals that testosterone and estrogen metabolize into. These are sometimes called human pheromones, and some (cis?) people find that wearing extra of the ones associated with their assigned at birth gender affects how people respond to them - levels of flirting, respect, etc.\n\nThe \"pheromones\" are already used as ingredients in commercial perfumes, generally marketed as a way to attract a date. The stinky cheese sweat chemical has also been used in commercial fragrances (though I don't know *why*...) and the estrogen-dominant sweat smell might be, too. This doesn't mean /too/ much about safety, because fragrances are practically unregulated in the US, but it implies that making a cologne that makes a person smell more like an un-perfumed person with the opposite dominant hormone might be possible.\n\nDoes this seem worth pursuing? I'm considering investing the time and money to figure out how to do this, especially if it might be useful to others, but I'm not sure if smell has enough of an effect to be worth it, or if this might have risks I'm not aware of. (I do realize it won't be perfect, since it's applied on top of a person's existing smell.) \n\nCome to think of it, might this be useful for trans people who don't like the way that hormones change their odor?

I have no idea what I'm doing.  But I feel so goddamn alone right now and I could really benefit from someone hearing my story.  So I guess I'll post this on Reddit and see if anything good comes of it.  \n\nHey everyone, cis straight male here.  I'm 19 years old and very, very confused.  But I'll take a deep breath and start from the very beginning.\n\nI was born to a religious family.  Raised Mormon, in a household that felt kind of devoid of paternal presence and such.  I was the lonely brother, outnumbered by three sisters, my mother stayed at home and my father worked day in, day out.  I'm number 3 of 4 and in my second year of college.\n\nAnyway, being raised Mormon, my world view was narrow and built for me.  There were certain fundamental truths that defined my life and my interactions, i.e. there is a universal, undeniable truth and good and morality.  And one of those was that God created each and every human being precisely as he wanted, and that genders and gender roles exist for a reason.  They are a part of one's divine destiny and to go against such destiny is blasphemy.  I mean, I never really thought too much of it.  I never really sought any of those huge truths for myself; I more or less went to church because my family did.  For a time, I think I did believe, but I guess it's obvious that I don't anymore.\n\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself, here.  Ever since I was little, I've had this strong desire to be something other than what I am.  When I was a toddler, I wanted to be a dog... when I was eight, I wanted to be a Pokemon.  And I suppose this all culminated at the point I reached a few years ago... that I wanted to be a girl.\n\nI'm not one of those people who had a childhood in which they always wanted to play with dolls or dress up and their father simply didn't let them.  My toys were dinosaurs and cars and legos (I know that it's not right to categorize toys into 'girl' vs 'boy' but hey, the psychology and stuff suggests that there is a difference), and I was actually terrified of my sisters' Barbies.  When I was little, I first wanted to be a firefighter, then a veterinarian.  I don't think I had aspirations to be anything other than what my parents said was normal, and no one's childhood recollection is super accurate so I'm trying to remain objective, compare what I remember with my mother's account.  But as far as she says, I was a normal, healthy, happy child, and I fit in well with all the other boys my age.\n\nThere are weird things I remember that always made me feel a little out of place, like the fact that Wurmple was my favorite pokemon because it was so stinkin' cute, and my friends all laughed at me for that, instead opting for the more badass ones, y'know, little things like that.  Once everyone started hitting puberty, I was tiny compared to my male peers.  I got picked on relentlessly because I was horrendous in our P.E. games and didn't know how to throw a football.  I remember my dad trying to teach me how to throw a punch and being disappointed that I couldn't land a good one.  And those bullies always attacked my masculinity calling me the classic middle school insults.  At one point, one called me out for holding my books like a girl with them close to my chest.  They said I ran like a girl and threw like a girl.\n\nI watched a lot of TV when I was little, mostly Nickelodeon.  There was some show called 'Mr. Meaty' and while I never watched it, I saw a handful of commercials for it.  There was one episode where they had the 'girly burger' or something like that with some special 'girl sauce' on it.  Anyway, the male characters accidentally ingested some and became female temporarily.  All I remember was chills down my spine, a whispered 'I want that' in the back of my mind.\n\nThere was the episode of Drake and Josh where Drake jokingly suggests that Josh become a woman to get out of some crazy misfortune they found themselves in.  And I remember getting chills again, finding out that a transition is actually possible, and then I dreamed of it for the next few days.  This episode broke that predetermined set of values that I had inherited from my faith and asserted that just because I am a male does not mean I necessarily need to be one.  And I found that exhilarating.\n\nGranted, I was still very young.  These experiences are from my elementary school days, and these ideas quickly faded from mind.  But later when the bullying picked up and I found myself all alone, I wondered what the hell made me such an odd fit with my peers.  And I don't know if I'm just remembering it incorrectly, but today, I think it was my feminine disposition that they picked up on and drilled me for.\n\nSo I guess that'll suffice for the 'early life' section of this wikipedia page.  Everything henceforth is from (give or take) the past 5 years.\n\nMy sophomore year of high school, I began to have firm doubts about my faith, and by junior year, I decided I wanted nothing to do with it.  But I never told my family.  I persisted in the church, keeping up this facade that I was the good, faithful Mormon boy.  I lived under that guise for way too long, I even spent my first year of college and Brigham Young University to keep it up until that institution finally broke my spirits and I transferred to a state school.  But with this identity shattered, I was left to discover myself as an individual, to discover my own beliefs and philosophies, etc.  I was so lost.  I putted around, sank deep into depression and was barely saved by my tiny circle of friends.  I just felt so alone, like I'd never be understood, that I could never afford to reveal myself to my family because of how they'd respond.  I knew my apostasy would break their hearts and I just couldn't stand to witness that.\n\nSo I persisted, going to church and all that.  But there was a point in my senior year where I think all this dysphoria finally caught up to me.  I've always been self-conscious about my body, wearing shirts at the beach and in the pool, and once I was largely finished with puberty, I had some excess breast tissue.  It wasn't that much and I still have it today, but it was certainly noticeable.  The very few times they saw me shirtless, my friends would comment on how huge or floppy my nipples were and that always made me feel godawful.\n\nSo I tried working it off, using the rowing machine in the basement, running outside, cross fit... but none of it worked.  And one night, when I couldn't sleep, I just stood in the bathroom and stared at my naked body, crying at what I saw.  And throughout my life, I've had a lot of thoughts that I would be better off female, but I think this is the first time I REALLY thought it.  Like I would've accepted an offer to switch in a heartbeat.\n\nThe thought scared me, even though it made sense.  I opened my laptop, my first instinct was to search for some test I could take that would tell me definitively whether or not I was trans.  Something came up, I did it, and it declared me androgynous.  I cried myself to sleep that night and fell into one of my deepest depressive slumps and this question was the foremost in my mind.\n\nI spend that summer depressed as hell.  I was working for my dad and the job sucked ass, I was having this internal battle of whether my body agrees with my identity, and I was still keeping up this image of the loyal, religious son.  And that fall, I set out for BYU.\n\nI never told anyone any of this.  I'd heard my parents talk about depression in very scathing, stigmatizing words.  They said depressed kids were just entitled pricks looking for a handout, so I obviously didn't go to them.  But I had a high school friend who had recently left her family's faith, so I called her up when I couldn't bear to keep pretending.\n\nI told my parents via written letter and talked about it over the coming weeks and months with them.  Things got bad, then they started to get better.  And then I was hit with this wave of dysphoria again, on top of this crisis.\n\nI called the same friend from before and told her between sobs.  She was so sympathetic and understanding and told me that I can't force an answer to a question like this.  I had to pull a Doctor Strange and submit myself to the forces, rather than trying to manipulate them.  So that's what I tried to do, and it only got me so far.  I entered a cycle of \"alright, I'm good, gonna be a male, hoo-ha\" to \"if there was a god, I would've been born a girl...\" so on and so forth.\n\nI left BYU with these questions still on my mind.  In my dreams, I would be female, in a handful I was just cross-dressed.  I had dreams about my mother and letting her down and I just couldn't stand to do that.  There was the moment of bliss when I looked in the mirror and saw a confident woman stare back, but also the moment of despair when my mom saw right through me.\n\nArrive summer, I started working at Chipotle, and in the mornings I was home alone.  So I'd work on a feminine voice, then, and eventually I decided to try cross-dressing for the first time in my life.  And I loved it.  I did it for hours, in and out of my mom's closet, twirling in the mirror.  I watched vlogs of post-procedure trans women and felt so uplifted.  That summer, I frequented a therapist who helped me talk out my family and religion issues, though I was extremely hesitant to voice my gender concerns and didn't tell her until our remaining visits were very numbered.  Then I left for college again.\n\nAnd I guess that more or less brings us to the present.  The dysphoria comes and goes, but right now I'm in a slump.  I want insight, questions, just anything to help me feel like I'm not alone in this.  If you can help me figure this out, I'd love to hear what you have to say.  If this is something I just need to figure out for myself, please help me do that.  The biggest thing, I guess, is that I'm just so goddamn afraid.  I'm terrified that I'll make the wrong choice and regret it forever, or that I'll be ousted by my family and what few friends I have.  I'm worried I'll never be able to pass as a woman, and that I'll be too embarrassed to go outside when I'm in the middle of transitioning.\n\ntl;dr: I don't feel like I fit the stereotypical trans girl mold, but I'm in crisis and could use some insight.\n\nThanks so much ahead of time.", "date": "2017-11-20 01:05:27", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7e5331/my_story_please_help_me/", "author": "SauteedAsparagus"}, {"title": "Needed vent", "text": "[deleted]", "date": "2017-11-20 05:28:09", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7e6lra/needed_vent/", "author": "[deleted]"}, {"title": "For those who are struggling (Trans Lifeline: 877-565-8860)", "text": "", "date": "2017-11-20 06:28:01", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7e6x3g/for_those_who_are_struggling_trans_lifeline/", "author": "bandanagirl95"}, {"title": "I am confused about who I am", "text": "[removed]", "date": "2017-11-20 08:04:19", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7e7d0y/i_am_confused_about_who_i_am/", "author": "IKindaSortaHateMysel"}, {"title": "Breaking in my new pink pumps", "text": "", "date": "2017-11-20 09:20:11", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7e7oik/breaking_in_my_new_pink_pumps/", "author": "LadyTen"}, {"title": "Live Duet With Myself - Victor Quinlan.

I'm trying to bring my weight down a bunch before they give me the actual E pills, but I'm now waiting on a letter being sent to my doctor so he can write me the prescription. (Which I won't be taking to my local pharmacy, screw that, they're all judgy pricks.)\n\nI'm still a couple weeks off, but I'm free and clear now. Four years of waiting. Let me tell you how my day went.\n\nThe start of the day was stressful, horrible and annoying. I woke up at two in the god damn morning after barely sleeping at all, I got showered and made it to the train station with seconds to spare. The train was in, the first ticket machine was being a git and the second one had four people ahead of me. The train was about two minutes for leaving, I start using the machine and stick my card in. Like an idiot I use the wrong PIN the first time so I have to do the whole thing again.\n\nI got my tickets, fucked off up to Edinburgh with about an hour to spare before my appointment, so I decided to go to CEX and buy a bunch of DVD's again. Yeah, I still watch DVD's. Sue me.\n\nAfter a liberal slathering of purchases and Howl's Moving Castle not being in stock *again* I went up to Chalmers. Now, I'm not gonna lie, I'm a fat bugger, so I wanted a burrito. The burrito van was shut, so my plan to get them before the appointment went out the window. I went on past, went into the clinic to be taken early and then I sit in front of the endo while he talks a bunch about stuff that's not important.\n\nThen he says the thing. I expected to be told I'm too fat and I'd have to lose a couple stone before they'd give me anything. I was right in thinking that, that's the reason they've dodged doing anything for the last nearly two years. This time I was wrong. The dude told me he'd write my doctor to tell him to write me a prescription of T blockers. I was struggling not to smile when he told me, it was the best news I could've hoped for. \n\nSo now I'm on a high, I'm excited, I'm relieved and I wanna go cry happy tears for a change. This is when I got my burritos. I got two, one to give to a family member, then headed off to Primark to have a nosey around for Christmas presents and boxers. I prefer loose underwear, okay? Don't judge me. Especially you back there, I can see you. \n\nLong story short everything went really well after this. Sure my burrito got poked open by my headphones, but a quick tin foil purchase repaired it and it didn't leak that badly. I got me a quick Maccy D's (not helping the weight loss there, huh?) then hopped on down to the platform for my train. \n\nThere was a guy with a single rose. He sat in a shelter on the platform, a smile on his face as he gazed lovingly at his phone. I got on my train, got sat down and all comfy like. At this point the train hadn't been marked for a destination or anything, but that's fine because it wasn't the wrong train anyway. I looked out the window to see Rose Guy standing waiting while a train pulled in from across Scotland, when it did a bunch of folk got off. That's how trains work. Boom, he finds who he's looking for, gives her the rose and, in a fantastic romantic gesture, they hug and do couple stuff, idk.\n\nMy point is it was wholesome AF, especially for the middle of Edinburgh on a busy Tuesday. Oh yeah, this happened Tuesday lmao. Anyway, it was cute and made me smile. Then I smiled about my good news. Smiling topped with a smile sauce, prepared with a happiness I've never felt before when I looked out at Scotland rolling by as I headed home. \n\nTuesday was a mixed bag. Sure, I got my clearance for hormones, I got a burrito then I saw some wholesome shit happen. It was great until my aunt took real bad ill and I had to go up to hospital with her and only got home at like 4AM.\n\nTL;DR Tuesday was cool, I saw some cute shit, my aunt went into hospital but I got hormone clearance.\n\nWhat now?

I was in a really weird place mentally, kind of a depression but maybe it was just a place of like being confused about my gender, and all this stuff.

Here's how it has gone.", "text": "I've been trying to think of a good first post in here, and didn't wanna do the classic \"hi\" post (not that there is anything wrong with those, just not my speed).  So, after a bit of thought, figured I'd just say what I've been going through the past few weeks, what lead up to it, and thoughts on the future.  I know this sub, like all trans-centric subs, gets a lot of curious lurkers, and maybe my story might help someone.\n\nFirst, the basics.  I'm a 34yo AMAB.  I'm married to one of the best women on earth.  I work an entry level corporate job, and live with three room mates I consider good friends.\n\nI have been some flavor of depressed all my life.  No suicidal ideation or self destructive tendencies (thank chickens, I don't know if I'd been strong enough to resist those), but just this constant feeling of, well, not right.  It was like I didn't belong, like I was always on the outside, and I certainly felt unworthy.  I hated myself.\n\nI always, however, just chalked up the self loathing to poor life choices.  Didn't finish high school, didn't go to college, bad first marriage, bad with money, lazy, out of shape; all of these were what I believed was the source of all of it.  And this had gone on for a *long* time.\n\nAbout two years ago, a good friend of mine publicly came out as trans.  I really value my friends; they are the family I choose.  So, I started learning about being trans, what it entails, the difficulties trans folk face, and so on.  I wanted to be there for them, so I had to know about all of this.\n\nInterestingly, within a short time after that, a couple more of my friends also came out as trans, and I met some other trans friends through them.  I figured that, well, I've always known interesting people, I'm a geek and a gamer, isn't too odd that I know a bunch of trans folk.  That, and I'd been learning about what it is to be transgender, supporting my friends, so maybe I was just comfortable.\n\nNow, some way, way back-story here, before we go on.  I've always liked feminine clothing.  I didn't tell too many people about this, but it has always been the case.  I was the early teen who tried on his mother's clothes when no one was home.  And in my late teens, I went through a \"cross dressing\" phase.  I was lucky enough to have some very open minded and caring friends, and I often went days presenting female at their place.\n\nI knew one person trans at that point.  They were FtM, and they stayed with one of my friends for a time.  Being young, though, I just assumed they were a masculine lesbian, and didn't dig any further.\n\nEventually, I drifted away from those friends, and away from feminine clothing.  It didn't occur to me how comfortable I felt in them, and I pushed away the memories of wishing I could just live like that.\n\nNow, add over a decade of time passed, a couple of failed serious relationships, and a \"meh\" series of jobs that generally have paid the bills well enough (not really). Toss in 80 or 90 pounds gained. Along with that, put a successful marriage I do not deserve, and am eternally grateful for.\n\nI had recently, about six months ago, started dieting to lose weight, and have had some success.  I was feeling better about my self image, enough to try shaving my face, something I hadn't done in years.\n\nA good friend and my wife were both curious about me cross dressing again.  They thought it would be fun.  My wife is a cosmetologist, wanted to maybe do my hair and make-up.  I wasn't feeling as fat as I have, so I agreed.\n\nWell, I did, and got a look at myself, and things suddenly felt different.  Really different.  Better.  I felt good.  But the clothes weren't the only thing that changed.  My personality felt more open, I felt less weighed down, just, I felt...\n\n...happy.  I felt happy.  I'd forgotten what it was like.\n\nSo, I realized I needed to talk to people.\n\nI reached out to my trans friends.  I talked with them about my feelings, and they gently encouraged me to explore them.  Never anything heavy handed, never what they thought or didn't think I \"was\". Lots of questions and listening, lots of careful guidance towards introspection.\n\nI first thought I was genderqueer.  Like, it has to be in the middle, right?  I'm a little of A, a little of B, somewhere around there.  And I did talk some with the lovely people in r/genderqueer, though I more read their posts, heard what they had to say.  They helped me a lot.\n\nBut it wasn't quite right.  I wasn't in the middle, or even a little to one side.  \n\nMy room mates were all understanding, and I began presenting feminine at home.  It quickly became an all the time thing when I wasn't out and about.  Unless someone was over who didn't know, I was lounging about in shorts and a camisole, doing chores in a sweater dress, whatever.   I stopped wearing briefs, started wearing panties all the time.  I got a bra.  I really like my bra.\n\nI picked up a skin care routine, because I realized I really like to be pretty.  And there wasn't self loathing involved.  It wasn't \"you look like shit, fix it\".  It was \"I like being pretty and delicate, how can I get there more?\".  I started having an easier time working out, and my diet wasn't as much of a chore.\n\nI had discovered motivation again.  I was experiencing ambition.  I have struggled with ambition for over a decade.\n\nThis pushed me to more talks with my friends, more thoughts, more discussion...\n\nIt was interesting where the revelation came from.  I had messaged one of my trans friends, and asked her \"Do you know any exercises that target and tone the pectorals, but don't work the arms very hard?\". \n\nYeah, I know, that should been a revelation moment.  But it wasn't yet. It did, however, allow her to answer in the most witty way possible, which was to send a picture of the chemical composition of estrogen.\n\nI loved the humor in it.  I'm a nerd, it was a science joke, it was great.  I showed my wife, she... didn't laugh.\n\nShe was suddenly concerned with what would happen if I decided to go on hormones.\n\nSo, we had a talk.  I told her I wasn't considering that at all, but hypothetically, we could absolutely look through what that would entail.  So I read up with her, looked into the physiological changes estrogen would cause.  I told her the truth, that no matter who I am, or realize I am, I still love her, and always will.  And that helped her, and she was better, and supportive.\n\nAnd now, I had hormone therapy on the brain.  And how difficult it would be to get, *hypothetically*.  And how much it would cost, *hypothetically*.  And how long changes take, *hypothetically*.\n\nAnd I watched videos, and I realized that my self loathing, and my lack of ambition, and my feelings of isolation and being on the outside, could all be marked up to gender dysphoria.\n\nAnd I talked with my friends more.  And I asked myself more questions.  And I finally came to a conclusion.\n\nAnd I contacted a lot of my friends, trans and not, and told them my revelation: I am a woman.  I am a trans woman.\n\nAnd a lot asked if I was sure.\n\nAnd I told them yes.\n\nAnd a lot of them then said something to the effect of, \"Fucking hell, took you long enough to figure it out, we've known for months/years.  Congratulations, love.\"\n\nO_O\n\nApparently, I was one of the few surprised.\n\nSo, here I am.  I'm still not publicly out, but I know who and what I am, and it helps SO much.  It's like a limiter had been taken off my brain.  I'm happy. I'm actually fucking happy.\n\nAnd I'm terrified.  There is so much ahead of me.  There are so many people in the world that already hate me, and they've never even met me.\n\nBut I am also amazingly lucky.  I have friends who are ridiculously supportive, and a wife who is not only overjoyed to see me happy again, but honestly gets a kick out of buying me clothes and shopping with me.\n\nAs of where I'm going, I'm doing what a few friends recommended, which is slowly edging towards public presentation.  I'm \"feminizing\" my masculine styles, slowly switching out of my old \"potato sack\" clothes, working my way I to the feminine side of androgynous for now.\n\nI figure early next year, maybe February, I'll look into the medical side of things.  Talk to a doctor and a therapist.  Look into HRT.\n\nBecause, well, I'm a woman.  Always have been.  Just took me way too long to find myself.\n\nAnywho, if you've read through all this, thank you.  If you're lurking in here, unsure of who or where you are right now, I hope it helped.  And if anyone has advice, omg, FEEL FREE to stick it in the comments.  I'm game for any tidbits of knowledge, and I'm sure others reading this would love it too.\n\nAnd, well, I guess... hi.  :-)", "date": "2017-12-01 07:18:18", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7gth39/well_figured_out_im_a_trans_woman_heres_how_it/", "author": "Mewing_Raven"}, {"title": "[VIDEO] Lexie talks about Explaining Yourself.

After mulling this over in my mind I came to the idea of being raised in a time when being Trans was not accepted and how that has affected my views of dating someone who is trans. I am straight and not trans but despite thinking it over I do not think I could date a trans person. My reasoning being is that I am strictly attracted to male attributes so 1, I could not date someone who had transitioned to, or stayed physically as female so mtf or physically female were out. Moving on from this I also do not like the idea of dating women because that simply brings to mind the physical parts of women. So I'm not sure if I could.\nMy main question is this: I usually date people for their personality, but being physically attracted to them is something I want I'm my relationships. So am I somehow thinking this over wrong and being held back by some internal bias? Am I really just unattached to trans people? And is that even okay to not be attracted to it or is that discriminatory and wrong because I know I can't change what I am attracted to but it feels like I shouldn't be saying I wouldn't date a person who is physically male just me cause they are female originally or in their spirit.

As the title suggest, I'm gender confused, and while nobodies opinion on here replaces professional help, I'm kind of in a position where professional help isn't affordable, so it would be nice to hear some opinions on my situation.\n\nWhen I was a kid, for as long as I can remember I wanted to be a a girl. There were three girls my age that lived on my street when I was a kid, and they were my friends growing up. I played with dolls with them and did other girly things. I remember one point one of the girl's mothers got married, so we got to go to a wedding. I was honestly super jealous that the girls got to wear dresses and I couldn't wear one. When I would be home laying in bed by myself, I often wished there would be a magic pill I could take that would turn me into a woman. I was got obsessed with it to the point I went as far as to stealing my moms clothes to wear them and pretend I'm a woman.\n\nHowever around when I became a teen things changed a lot. The first thing that happened when I was in about 6th grade, my dad caught me dressed up in my mom's clothes. He was really disappointed and let me know about it. I felt so ashamed after that. So I stopped doing that, I tried to be a guy after that, I don't wanna be a disappoint to my parents. On the surface, I seemed like a normal cis guy, but I still felt the want to be a woman. But when I get to middle school my cast of friends change completely. Two of the three girls moved away, and my relationship with the other one declined to the point where we were hardly friends. So my new cast of friends is basically all male. I seem like a normal cis male on the outside. I must be a guy that was just confused as a kid is all right? Well I now kind of alternate between two clashing ideas.\n\nThe first one is that I'm definitely a guy that was confused as a kid, and the only reason I have these thoughts now is because I can't get a girlfriend. I know the girlfriend thing sounds stupid, but I'm honestly obsessed with the idea of getting one. Sometimes I feel like if I could get a girlfriend, it would end all thought of being transgender.\n\nThe other idea that goes in my head, is that I'm clearly a woman in a man's body that is just in flat out denial because of societal pressure. I think a lot about \"what if I could magically turn into a woman?\" I oftentimes conclude I would be a lot happier if I could. \nI don't do girly things like I did as a kid, but I own a set of woman's clothes and will wear them in my room by myself where I can't be seen. Don't do it as often as I could, but I do it. I also set most of my online avatars(like in online video games and stuff) to female, and never release the info that my gender is male in real life.\n\nNobody can diagnose me online, only a professional can. But what are your opinions on me being transgender or not? \n\nTL;DR: I alternate between thinking I'm transgender and I'm cis.

If you have advice, awesome, but really, I just need to say this to a bunch of people who get it.\n\nI've understood that I am trans for about a month now.  And, like with many of you, the realization and truth was freeing and uplifting.\n\nHowever, now I'm seeming to have a little trouble embracing my feminine, erm, \"persona\"?  Though it might be better to say that I'm having trouble discarding or distancing myself from my false \"male\" persona.\n\nMy previous coping mechanism for dealing with my misunderstood dysphoria was to simply embrace my flaws as my me.  My depression, my self loathing, my over-analytical, neurotic nature, I embraced and protected.  Even as it was damaging me, I held on tighter, under this tragically romantic fallacy that if I internalized it hard enough, I'd, I dunno, work?  Yeah, I know, i was doomed, but i didn't realize yet.\n\nSo, now I'm at this weird in-between, stuck in the middle of embracing my female identity, but still \"untangling\" myself from the man I thought I was.  \n\nI mess up on my own pronouns in my head, and I call myself my old name.  And it isn't comforting.  I described it to my wife as, like in a show or movie, how they will sometimes visually represent depression or sadness by showing the colors dim and drain around a person, like a blue-tone filter applied to everything.  That's how it feels when I misgender myself, or think about crawling back inside my old male clothes, and hiding again.  But it's familiar, and usual.\n\nOne the other side, when I'm gendered correctly, by myself or others, or when I'm in confirming clothing, or call myself my name, it's bright and vibrant, and happy.  But it's also new, and unfamiliar.\n\nAnd because of this, part of me wants to rush my transition as much as possible, to force everything into the world regardless of consequence.  However, this would not work yet.  I live in a conservative part of town, and I have a job I cannot, simply cannot, present while attending to.  Also, I'm still working towards getting my body where I want it, and embracing my own features in a feminine sense.  The last thing I want to do is push too hard, get the \"man in a dress\" kind of dysphoria, and scare myself into hiding again.  Depression is horrible and painful, but it is familiar, and familiarity has a weird, fucked up appeal.\n\nSo, i'm here.  I'm working on getting more feminine \"masculine\" clothes, such as women's jeans and shoes, more colorful shirts, things that still kinda pass for \"guy\", but let me feel like I'm being the girl I am.  I'm trying to call myself a woman, use my name.  I'm trying to see the girl that is there.  And I see it, sometimes.  I just wish I could get there faster.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading.

My name is Grady, I've been on HRT  (ftm) for about 6 weeks, I just had a meeting with my parents. We talked about my future, which always seems like a tricky topic for me. I mentioned how a bucket list goal was mine to get my name changed before 2018-2019 new years eve. My parents kept saying \"Well Gray, you always keep asking for more and more? Name, pronouns, hormones, and now a name change? Aren't you ever satisfied?\" I don't know how to communicate with my parents. Dysphoria literally cripples me into constantly feeling numb for a while when a change happens and then finding a week spot to target again. Its constantly making me feel less and isolating myself because I so uncomfortable with my chest without a binder or my voice in the early stages of transition. I feel I just want to take a deep breath and be greatful for my parents support, some kids don't have what I have and I feel greedy sometimes for asking for more?

Just wanted to talk about somethin for a little bit. I just made a new account after using my old one with my deadname on it for five years and wanted to make a first post with it.\n\nMy name is Dahlia, and I'm a trans woman of 21. I've been officially out for almost two and a half years, and I've only been on HRT for two months. I'm not good at makeup, my executive dysfunction makes it hard to get out of bed and brush my teeth, never mind shaving. I don't usually wear what most people would consider \"feminine\" clothing, being that it's not my personal style and it's getting cold here in Denver, CO.\n\nI'm pretty involved in the underground music scene in Denver; I play in two bands, [Flower Crown Me A Queen](https://flowercrownmeaqueen.bandcamp.com) and [Ludlow](https://ludlowmassacre.bandcamp.com), the latter of which has all trans members. I'm generally well known here as far as underground shows go, which are populated by folks like me: Gender-nonconforming, a rejection of the binary, disdain for authority and rules, and a presentation to match. I've got a beard, I dress in alternative fashion and I don't act explicitly feminine, because that's not who I am. I'm a firey, runaway cart that doesn't care if there are roadblocks in my path. I'm getting to where I'm trying to go.\n\nI'm just having trouble reconciling these spaces where I am welcomed and appreciated and respected, not in spite of my being transgender, but very much because of it, and how I still get misgendered at work by customers, and by strangers on the street and in my neighborhood. I know that it's because of my unwillingness to pass, partly because I know I can't yet (so why bother?) and also because I shouldn't need to pass in order to be respected. I shouldn't need to bend over backwards for people who couldn't give less of a fuck if I fit into the boxes they try to stuff me into. They won't be satisfied until they can't tell the difference between a trans person and a cis person, and even then there's still laws being made about us and a murder rate that's phenomenally fucked up.\n\nI don't wanna hide. [I don't want to have to force myself back into the closet if I can help it](https://sheherhers.bandcamp.com), and I want to make a world where people don't have to do that in order to be respected. I just want to be treated like a person, no strings attached, no fine print.\n\nIt was a lot easier when I was younger and there were less immediate consequences. Being a transgender adult in the US right now is a lot fucking harder than it should be, and I'm just mad about it. I needed to talk about it. It should be addressed and I don't know what avenues people would be willing to listen to. I'm frustrated, and tired. And I kinda just want to know that I'm not alone in this.\n\nI'm sorry this post got so long.

I was surprisingly annoyed as a cis woman by this particular person's choice to be \"trans.\" Okay, so as a trans person, you get to wear women's clothes when it suits you, but grow a beard and wear men's clothes when it will benefit your career? You don't buy me a drink when we go out on our first date, but you get to suggest sex repeatedly throughout the night (when I say I just want to take things slow and connect emotionally), basically, just be an entitled man to the NTH degree. Bragging about your blossoming business and all the connections you have through your family and 'mentors.' I can't take it. I'm like, okay, so you just want to be a trans person because you want to escape the societal expectations of being a 'man,' but still maintain the perks? Fuck that. The expectations we place on men are there for a reason. Namely, white, socioeconomically privileged men are given HUGE advantages in this society. Being a man means you have more to give, period. And yet, they take, and take and take and take. And don't know any better. How can you be so ignorant? As a cis woman, I face glass ceiling after glass ceiling in my career. The men who would 'mentor,' me tend to just hit on me, and when I reject them, refuse to promote me. The women I work for are struggling themselves, and are usually supported by a man to help them make ends meet financially. \n\nNot to mention, they got off, and then left immediately. \n\"Do you want to get off?\" \n\nOhh, no. I'm just the girl who's been accepting a man in silk underwear and a bra in her bed for the first time with an open and supportive mind. Definitely don't even try to grab my boobs or get me off in any way (me entirely clothed, them, mostly naked). I even felt some mild shaming from them about my body hair - total double standard.\n\nBasically, in sum, I'm like, okayyy dude, so you're going to be the entitled overly confident mediocre white man AND wear my underwear, bra and clothes? You really don't know where to stop. \n\nThis person even admitted they decided to become trans after their gf was angry with them for not fulfilling her expectations of being a man (read maybe just respectful partner?!?). \n\np.s I expect a ton of backlash here... this isn't easy to articulate. I have some very close trans friends, and I empathize greatly with them. This particular individual though... wth. \n\nEDIT: Just found this, which seems to go along with my ideas at the moment:\n\n\"In a society where men hold power, the most powerful thing a woman can do is to have influence over men. The idea of a member of an oppressed class influencing the powerful is fundamentally threatening to the existing order of society, because it puts some degree of power into the hands of those oppressed people. \n\nInitially, Siren mythos reflected an existing fear of the female potential to tempt and ruin powerful men. But over the course of centuries, their story grew into a tool to reinforce that fear. Sirens grow from a few sisters stranded on an island by a curse, to a working class of Sicilian prostitutes, to all women.

So he hasn\u2019t been able to take his shot in 2 weeks going onto 3 weeks and he\u2019s starting to get a lot of mood swings.

He made the appointment to get the prescription and they told him they were going to call it into Walgreens the next day. So a few days go by and they didn\u2019t call Walgreens to refill it.

I always was more of a girl than a boy. When inwas a child i always had long hair and liked girly things. Well, when i started hitting puberty i felt kinda forced to stop that and be a normal boy, i started to be someone who i really didnt want to be, just so i could fit in. i lost all of my self esteem in the process, started to hate myself, and i just wanst happy over the last two years. Well, now that started to change. Since the last 2 months or so there have been some big changes to myself, started wearing feminine clothes, dyed my hair blue and started wearing makeup. And i love it, it makes me look so much better! Also i've now accepted that i'm pansexual. Well, the thing is, that's not enough. I feel weird in my body, i don't feel like i'm a boy. My parents told me one thing that helped me to understand this: that i wasn't born entirely male. i was born without balls. I had a surgery at the age of one so i could have them, and be a normal boy. it worked, biologically i'm a boy now. But, while my parents could make my body a boy, my brain isn't.\n\nIf i could just push a button and wakeup as girl tomorrow, i'd do it. And i would be so so happy.\nBut, well, thats where my problems start. \n\nI'm extremely afraid of transitioning. I dont know if i could do it. I'm so afraid that i couldn't pass as a girl, even though i have a very feminine [figure/face](http://imgur.com/8kQdpRR) because my puberty stuffed me full of female hormones. I'm just afraid that people would know that i'm not a real girl. Also my voice is way too deep..  is a deep voice something you can change at all? The thing i'm most afraid of is, that i would loose all of the people i hold dear. I dont know what they would say. I'm afraid that they would see me as a freak. I dont wanna be that.. i dont wanna be a boy in a dress, i wanna be a girl, the one thing i was always meant to be. I know my parents would support me because they know about how i was born. but everyone else..? i get made fun of just for wearing makeup. I feel that, if i'm going to be a girl, then i'd have to start a new life as a girl. Somewhere where no one knows im not really a girl. And i dont know if i could ever do that.\n\nI don't know if i'm fully 100% just a girl tho, like, if i could i would want to swap genders like i want to. I'd like to be a girl mostly but also be able to be a boy sometimes.So maybe i'm bigender?

I\u2018m 17 and my family is on my side, and will help me, also my best friends also sad they think its cool that i\u2018m doing this and that they\u2018re surely be helping me.

I thought that i could accomplish that with extensions? Is my hair long enough to wear extensions, would they work on me or what should i do..? Does anyone have some experience with them? \n\nI do wanna start with HRT, my parents are okay with it but i\u2018m a bit confused about the whole process in austria. I dont know where to go really, do i just go to my doctor and tell them about it? I do need some doctors approval to do HRT so i guess i need to visit a psychiatrist...?

I hesitate before fixing this; it occurs to me that this is a thing women do.  This is a thing I do.  The presence of the camisole under my shirt comforts me, a reminder that, though the world presently sees me one way, I am something different.  I lightly smile from the validation as I think...\n\nIt's two months ago, give or take some days.  I've just slipped into my wife's Little Mermaid union suit, more than half as a joke.  I'd told a friend earlier that, since I had lost some weight, I'd be willing to try \"cross dressing\" again for kicks.  I used to do it some when I was younger, but I'd since gained weight, and didn't feel I could \"pull off the look\".  My wife had felt a little left out, so hopping into the jumper seemed a good way to make her grin.\n\nMy wife, she saw something, though, something I wasn't ready to acknowledge just yet.  She smiled, encouraged me to try on a camisole of hers.  It was light green, and a little too big, but it was nice, comforting.  I felt better than I had in a while.\n\nBut it was just a camisole.  Why would a shirt make me feel better?\n\nFlash back years ago.  It's about two decades past, actually, if I'm being honest.  I'm a teenager, and I'm at home by myself.  I can't remember where my younger brother was, but the important thing is he wasn't there.  I'm in my mother's bedroom, and I'm wearing a skirt of hers, as well as a blouse.  I have on a bra stuffed with socks.  I look in the mirror, and my heart is racing.  I'm confused, and excited, and honestly a little aroused.  I didn't understand euphoria, or elation.  I'd never heard the word \"trans\", and transvestites were those gay men who were always killed in movies.  \n\nI thought it was a kink.  I thought the clothes just turned me on.\n\nNow a few years later, I'm eighteen.  I have understanding friends who I spend a lot of time with.  They are older.  They have their own house.  They are the first poly triad I have ever known.  They are caring and accepting.\n\nWith their help, I experimented with \"cross dressing\".  I learned to apply basic makeup.  I bought my first panties.  I was happy when I wore these things.  I was a boy wearing women's clothes, and I was happy when I did.\n\nI talked to one of my friends there, stating I wanted to dress like that all the time.  I asked them if they knew anywhere what would allow that.\n\nIt was the early two thousands.  They were honest.  They told me that, sometimes men would dress in \"more effiminate\" clothes, in nice pretty shirts and form fitting slacks.\n\nI didn't want that.  I sat there in a lavender tank top and jean shorts with a pretty embroidered flower on the seat, and I began repressing.\n\nForward now, to just around this time last month.  I've been exploring, talking with my trans friends, talking with my wife.  The moment I realized I wasn't a cis male, that I was ANYTHING else, it was like a sickness had been cured.  So much of my self loathing, my depression, my pain, gone in practically an instant. The concept of internalized dysphoria became evident to me later, explaining so very many things.  I briefly entertained the thought of being genderqueer, but the comfort that I felt from my cotton panties, my new bralette, my camisole...\n\nAnd I'm back.  I reach under my collar, and pull up my camisole straps.  This is a thing women do.  This is what I do.\n\nI love camisoles.  :-)", "date": "2017-12-19 00:12:09", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7kpeme/writing_i_love_camisoles/", "author": "Mewing_Raven"}, {"title": "Christmas Savagery", "text": "Since my mom changed my Netflix name from \"Hannah\" to \"whatever\" I signed my Xmas present to her \"to mom from whatever\"\n", "date": "2017-12-19 02:45:22", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7kqbdw/christmas_savagery/", "author": "hannahtheviking"}, {"title": "I have an opportunity to start testosterone blockers", "text": "I'm just asking what experiences you had", "date": "2017-12-19 12:55:31", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7kt2rm/i_have_an_opportunity_to_start_testosterone/", "author": "dianeevolving"}, {"title": "transitioning f to m for about 17 months now, happy with results :D", "text": "", "date": "2017-12-19 20:30:13", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7kw0hf/transitioning_f_to_m_for_about_17_months_now/", "author": "The_Real_Orman_Ablo"}, {"title": "Nails Are Done !", "text": "", "date": "2017-12-19 22:00:25", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7kwmsn/nails_are_done/", "author": "Amber2718"}, {"title": "Thing that has surprised me: Different flavors of dysphoria.", "text": "One thing that has been an interesting, and upsetting, surprise to me since I came out to myself is the different kinds of dysphoria one can feel.\n\nUnderstand, before I came out to myself, I didn't realize I was experiencing dysphoria.  I just thought I had a serious self-loathing problem, and was fairly depressed.  I wasn't suicidal, I didn't self harm physically, and I functioned.  I mean, I said some REALLY eggy shit (\"I'd obviously prefer to be a woman, men suck, but I am this, and I gotta deal with it\"), but I still got by.\n\nOnce I realized I wasn't cis, nearly all of that lifted.  After some research, I came to realize this was an internalized dysphoria, manifesting as self loathing.  It felt heavy, and syrupy.  It felt like my everything was weighed down.  It was a limiter on being happy.\n\nSince then, I've experienced two other distinctly different kinds of dysphoria.\n\nThe first is, what I understand to be, a fairly traditional dysphoria.  It's realizing that I differ physically from what I understand myself to be emotionally.  This is usually brought on through trans music, writings, or something I make myself, like a poem or an entry on here.  It's the crying, the mild to moderate panic, the anger.  Most of us are familiar with this.\n\nThen, there is what I've started referring to as \"itchy\" dysphoria.  I get this when I have to present male, like at work, or when I do something like going to long since my last Nair session.\n\nItchy dysphoria feels like wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing underneath, but emotionally.  It's, like, mildly aggravating, and irritating.  It builds up over time, until I just HAVE to get into some confirming clothes, or get this body hair off, or shave my damned face.  It is frustrating, and bothersome, and well, \"itchy\".\n\nAnybody else get these?  Anybody else get any others?

Thought I'd document it here.\n\nSo a little backstory about me. I'm 31 MtF, been on HRT for about three months (started when I was thirty, but honestly its kind of a nebulous area with dates for me). I've got a bunch of old acne scars (from old self-harm days), though those (I know) only take a little makeup once I get the funds together to purchase some. I don't look the most feminine; in fact, to date the only feminine things about me are my hair and waist curvature, which I've thankfully maintained since I was twelve and trying to figure this shit out (yes, it took me eighteen goddamn years). I've also gained a meager amount of titflesh, which is nice. Also, still living with my parents. That's a story for another time.\n\nAnyway, today was kind of a trainwreck. A scheduled laser consultation (to find out if it can even help with my hair color) at 5, housekeeper comes at 12. Dad comes in, suggests we go out and get a bite to eat while HK does her magic dusting thing. We bounce after establishing that I'm broke (first gaffs, corsetry and bras ain't cheap, yo, gotta get them when the dough is floating) and its on his dime.\n\nHit up a kind of low-tier would-be classy place, relax, eat food, etc. I'm not presenting in any way other than my hair and voice, and I try to be pretty chill about pronouns and junk. It isn't my way to interrupt flow or try to jam a crowbar in a conversation that would otherwise last five seconds then leave us both feeling awkward.\n\nAnyway, its going fine- up until the point dad starts talking about his family; one of my grandmas and how she's doing, his family tree, and specifically how many suicides he's had in his family tree. Wonderful topics (clap clap). Especially considering this is the same grandma that only a few years ago was, around thanksgiving, telling me she was ready to stop living while I was trying to relax away from the crowd with a quiet cig (social anxiety coupled with minor dysphoria and primary-introvert personality. That's me).\n\nI try not to engage and worked to change topic, but it felt weird. Wouldn't it, for you?\n\nAnyway, about a half hour's gone by, so we finish eating and hop back in the car to go home so I can get ready for laser. ...And the conversation picks up where he left off before, this time about people getting older- like how he's 'twenty years from the average male death' (he's fifty-something), and how he wants to keep working until he kicks the bucket, so he's getting his master's (for the record, I'll be working to get an associate's here soon), yadda yadda, but he keeps hammering this one point- that the 'average male lifespan is seventy-five years'. Now he's a nurse- this kind of statistics shit (something I hold with derison) is his bread and butter, but me? I can't help but shut down. Fucking dying inside, for the first time since starting HRT.\n\nCan't get it out of my head how I should have sprung on this when I was twelve, how I effectively never was a teenager because I never got that angsty 16-year-old girl feels, how I never *will*, how by the time I'm actually the chick outside that I am inside I'll be halfway dead, how I've already had a bit of receding hairline (it isn't bad, my long hair covers it, but I gotta wear a hat when its windy), etc. etc. etc.\n\nAnd I can't help but put my face in my hands just for some feeling of support. Not crying, mind you. I don't cry. But the only emotion in me right then and there is dread. Not sorrow (that feels different to me. I dunno what, specifically, I was dreading), but dread.\n\nDad looks over, asks me if I'm okay, I ask (politely as I can. I was pretty shaken, it might have sounded crazier than I wanted it to) for a subject change, or that I can get out and walk home, and he says okay, we'll just go straight home instead of through the car wash. And immediately revs the engine, jumping from 0mph at a stop light to somewhere around 40-50, the wheels swerving as they tried to grip. To be fair, it was a semi-empty road. And we were in mom's sportscar, so maybe he just wanted to have fun with it?\n\nNow its no secret I've had a huge amount of anxiety, ever since I had a bit of a mental breakdown at College Attempt 1. This has lessened a lot (read: 80%) since starting estro, but I can still be a little easy to set off at times with paranoia or worries. Right here, right now, I felt myself crawling up the back of the seat. I don't even know if I said anything, that's how messed up I was right then and there. I still feel it a little, sitting down and writing this up.\n\n\"What's wrong with you? Maybe you should talk to your therapist about getting something for your anxiety.\"\n\nI didn't even know what to say. Right then and there, I wanted to scream, cry, run and strangle him all at the same time. I literally did not know what to do. He tells me later that he feels like he's walking on eggshells when talking to me, which I don't understand. Maybe he wants someone he can talk to about death and shit all the time? idk. Did I overreact? Am I overthinking this? Is this just all one weird coincidence that got strung together in my head to become despair, or was there some point here that I missed?\n\nBut yeah. I'm writing this so that, at some point, I can look back on it with maybe a little more knowledge. And so I can write down this next bit.\n\nI do know one thing. One very, very strange and important thing. One thing of such magnitude that I cannot forget or ignore it, because it is a good thing to come out of a shit day. I have discovered my will to live. Before all this, I was in a daze, learning little and knowing less, likely because my head was filled up with questions I was rejecting the answer to, and it was sapping my interest in survival. I don't think I even registered what it left behind as suicidal thoughts- just emptiness.\n\nBut if, in a vehicle I can't control, I suddenly claw my way up the back of the seat out of fear for the way its driving? I know I don't want to die anymore, if I ever did. I feel a need to live, now, if ever.

I was intrigued by the situation and decided to research more. That was in January, that is, practically 1 year.\nFrom that moment I began to have old memories of when I was little. I remembered when I prayed to God that when I woke up I would become a boy - and I really believed it would work. I did this for a while. I also remember heaving a time (I was still little) where I imagine myself as a boy. There were times when I would put the little shower in the middle of my leg and pretend that it was a penis - please do not laugh about it.\nI was still a little kid, I liked a girl (yes I know, sexual orientation is different from gender identity - I am bisexual with preference in women) but she was moving away from me. My thinking was: if the girls her age (she was 2 years older than me) like feminine things, I'll start using. Obviously, I did not last for long. And then came a phase of everyone wanting to change me - maybe people would already be realizing that it was diferente.\nAnd then I grew up a little. By the time I was 13, I began to realize that I was different from the other girls - I always knew, but I was percebed only when I have 13 years at the time. Then I started to be kidden in a healthy way - I told everyone that I was a boy. Was funny.\nAnd then came the documentary at age 14 and we got to where we are ..\nI remember when I was little I had also seen another documentary about transsexuals and had identified myself at the time. I was so distressed and wondered why all that identification. She was completely frightened. That intrigued me so much, that I searched the internet about what transgender people were - I had even asked my mother but she did not know what it was either - it happened that I ended up excluding all this idea from the head and I thought, 'Ah, it should not be anything at all ''. I literally forgot in 3 seconds what it was like to be transsexual.\nI'm afraid that all this is just a phase - no matter how much I look at the past at this moment, I realize that this has been with me for a long time.\nI try to suppress all this feeling of living the life of another person and accept myself as I am. But always when I do something that my other self would do ( maybe my true self, because I don't know if I'm a transsexual and can not take it anymore), inner peace reigns.\nAnd like things, I would like to give an example and say to dress in a '' masculine '' way.

And I still misgender myself.\n\nAnd I wanted to know why.  So I did the only thing I could think to do, which was think about it a lot.\n\nWhat I've realized is, well, kinda weird.\n\nWhen I thought I was a guy, I was miserable.  I mean, I didn't realize *how* miserable, because really, I'd just become extremely numb.  I mean, I'd have highs and lows, but looking back, everything was very muted.  I was nothing but shades of gray and brown, washed out, with differences only really standing out in comparison to the rest of me.\n\nAs I've said in previous posts, once I realized I was not cis, and especially when I understood I was a woman, I could *feel*.  This fog, this weight of what I thought was simple self loathing, it lifted off of me.  I could experience ambition and motivation again.  I could enjoy the moment.  I smiled.\n\nI also cried.  And I can't handle as much stress.  I can't tune out the emotional turbulence like I used to.\n\nAnd I noticed, when I would misgender myself, it was often in times of stress.  My thoughts of \"what if this is all just a phase\" would come at my worst times.\n\nUnderstand, if I embrace my femininity during these times, that also makes me feel better.  But instead, I find myself leaning into the old \"you're just a guy\" idea.\n\nI realized that the apathy, that numbness, that constant pain, gave me a perverse, self deprecating strength.  See, I was already hurting so much, more pain wasn't a big deal.  I was already so stressed, more was a marble on the pile.  I had cultivated an almost nihilistic apathy as a coping mechanism, and then used that as a coping mechanism against other stresses.\n\nIt was a crutch.  A broken, damaging crutch. And part of me misses it.\n\nI don't miss thinking I was a guy, mind you.  But I miss that ability to just \"handle\" anything.  To put myself in a box, and sort it out later, so I could handle the now.\n\nBut that isn't good. It isn't healthy.  I wasn't caring for myself, I was emotionally lobotomizing myself to progress through life.  Yeah, I got pretty good at it, but it was still damaging me.\n\nSo, now I'm making a conscious effort to lean into my gender more.  To embrace myself as a woman, and internalize the joy it brings me.  And yes, the stress is harder.  And hardships hurt a little more, and I can weather a lot less.  But I can be happy.  I can like myself.  \n\nI'd forgotten what it's like to like yourself.\n\nSo, I guess my point is, if you find yourself doubting your \"transness\", stop and ask why.  Really think about it.  Because you might just be missing what you were used to, even if it was hurting you.\n\nThanks for reading, and I still love you all. &lt;3", "date": "2017-12-27 01:25:56", "subreddit": "trans", "permalink": "/r/trans/comments/7mbupu/the_strength_of_apathy_and_the_hardest_part_about/", "author": "Mewing_Raven"}, {"title": "How do you pick a new name as a multicultural individual?

I always believed that trangenders should do what makes them feel better, does transition really help them or do they still battle depression afterwards...or do they even experience depression?

I'm currently 19 years old.\n\nThe first time i started questioning myself was 5 years ago, when i was 14. I didn't knew anything about being transgender/genderqueer or anything until i was 15. But i felt like there is something wrong with me. Then i found a random video on YouTube about a transgender man who talked about his transitioning. The whole thing just blow my mind and i felt like i finally knew who i'm. I did a lot of research about trans people, different identities, surgeries, hormone therapy and name changing. After all this i felt like o know what i want &amp; i was so happy. So i thought i should came out to my best friend.\n\nHowever when i /tried to/ came out to her, she said i'm too feminie to ever pass as a guy. This made me really depressed and broken. So for a whole year i give up on this whole gender identity thing. I tried to be more feminine &amp; just be a regular teenager and try to get a boyfriend. However i just got more &amp; more depressed so i give up on that too.\n\nA year later when i was 16, i become really anxious about everything and i realized i can't just let this gender thing go. I tried to become more masculine and cut my hair shorter, wore male clothes and also tried to bind my chest down with the only things i had back in the day, bandages &amp; sport bra's.\n\nI felt so much happier but i still felt like something is wrong. In the same year, i met with a girl who later on become my first partner and girlfriend. She was lesbian so i thought maybe i should be more feminine, for her. Later on, i realized once again i was not happy like that so i just stopped it and tried to be even more masculine than before.\n\nAnd an another year passed. I was 17 and my parents slowly noticed my changing and they were really mad. Mostly because my mother really disliked the relationship between me and my girlfriend. She thought i try to be more manly for her etc. I remember i once stole an unused underwear from my father who didn't mind it, but when my mother found it she was mad and went crazy on me saying things like \"you'll never have a dick get used to it\".\n\nMy girlfriend on the other hand asked me about this 'manly style of mine', and i don't remember how but i came out to her. She cried for weeks, and asked me to never go on hormones and stuff. Hovewer, months later she accepted me and said she will love me no matter what.\n\nAn another year passed, i was still unhappy but felt better than before because i felt like i was closer to accepting myself. I was 18 when my parents disowned, and kicked me out. They had enough of me &amp; my girlfriend. So i moved to my gf &amp; her mother.\n\nI felt more free than before actually. I finally got my first real chest binder, i was able to cut my hair more shorter and i could buy my own clothes from the man's section.\n\nSo.. Now i'm 19, and another year passed. I got a job, and i live in an apartment with my girlfriend. I was also able to get a packer/STP what actually helps a lot. And for the first time, i actually visited a therapist to finally start my transitioning i've been waiting for.\n\nBut after all this time, i still have some doubts. I'm afraid i'm just faking it. I'm afraid i just \"want to be transgender\" so it would be easier for me to understand myself. I'm afraid it's just a phase. My psychologist said, that transitioning might be not the best idea because after that i might still be feeling depressed and empty.\n\nI don't really like feminine things but sometimes i wear makeup &amp; dresses at home just for fun. Maybe it will sound strange but i still don't feel like a woman when i do that. I rather feel like a drag queen maybe..? Also i'm really attracted to guys. I've never been attracted to girls that much. I just say i'm bi/pansexual. But i don't know anymore. So i don't know what's up with me anymore.. When i was smaller i always hang out with boys &amp; i always dreamed about growing up to be a handsome man. I thought it was weird at the time, but i always imagined myself as a man when i grow up. Also there was a time when i asked my mother if she wanted to have a boy or a girl. She said she wanted a boy. And i said, \"well you can be happy because you got one\" and laught. I don't know where did that came from.. And there were other times when my family referred to me as a girl and i said 'but i'm not a girl'. \n\nI feel like it's weird but still.. What if i'm right?
